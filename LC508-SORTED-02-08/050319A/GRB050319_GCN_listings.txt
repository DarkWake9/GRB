<> V. Simon, R. Hudec (Astronomical Institute AV CR, Ondrejov, Czech

Republic) and G. Pizzichini, N. Masetti (INAF/IASF Bologna, Italy) report: 

<>
We have determined the color indices of the optical afterglow (OA) of

GRB050319 in its very early phase from the available data (GCN 3124, 

3129). The interpolation method described in Simon et al. (2001, A&A, 

377, 450) was used. Since the Swift UVOT magnitudes need a confirmation 

of their calibration, we determined the indices separately for UVOT and 

ground-based observations. The indices of the OA from UVOT are: 

t-To=0.0044 d: B-V=0.68; 0.0119: -0.10; 0.0625: 0.85; 0.1968: 0.64, 

while those of the ground-based observations (GCN 3124) are: t-To(d)=

0.331 d: B-R=0.73; 0.448: 1.12. The typical error of these indices is 

about 0.10 mag. 

 

The Galactic reddening E(B-V)=0.011, determined from the maps by 

Schlegel et al. (1998, ApJ, 500, 525), is comparable to the errors 

of the measurements. 

 

We note that the variations in B-V, with a peak at t-To=0.01 days, 

are caused by a plateau in B while the V magnitude was already 

steadily decreasing. The last two measurements from UVOT can 

suggest that B-V reached the value roughly consistent with the 

typical one for the ensemble of 23 OAs, defined by Simon et al. 

(2001; 2004, AIP Conf. Proc., Vol.727, p.487), not later than at 

t-To=0.06 days.

 

The indices of the OA of GRB050319 for t-To > 0.06 days thus appear 

to be plausibly consistent with the mean values of the ensemble 

(B-V)o=0.45+/-0.15, (B-R)o=0.86+/-0.17. This suggests that the shape 

of the spectrum of the afterglow of GRB050319 is similar to the other 

afterglows and that its intrinsic reddening (that is inside the host 

galaxy) must be again small (Simon et al. 2001; 2004, AIP Conf. 

Proc., Vol.727, p.487). Also the redshift of GRB050319 z=3.24 (GCN 

3136) suggests that this GRB appears to be another member of the 

above-mentioned ensemble of the OAs with z < 3.5. 

The search for the host galaxy and the determination of its type 

are also encouraged.

D. Sharapov, M. Ibrahimov,  R. Karimov, B. Kahharov (UBAI), A.Pozanenko
(IKI), V.Rumyantsev (CrAO),  G.Beskin (SAO) report:

We continue observation (Sharapov et al. GCN 3124) of GRB050319 afterglow
(Rykoff et al.  GCN 3116, Krimm et al. GCN 3117) with 1.5m telescope of
Maidanak Astronomical Observatory, Mt.Maidanak, Uzbekistan. R-band images
were taken in several sets of observation on March 19-22. Preliminary
photometry against of USNO-B1.0 Catalog is following:

Mean time  Exposure Filter  Mag.
(UT)         (s)

Mar.20 21:49  2640   R   21.62 (0.07)
Mar.21 21:34  1560   R   21.67 (0.09)
Mar.22 18:41  1260   R   21.27 (0.13)

Observations obtained on March 22 are not compatible with power law index
decay  1.59 (.05) for early and first day afterglow observations (Torii et
al. GCN 3132, Quimby, GCN 3135) suggesting a presence of knee or
re-brightening of the afterglow light curve.

Excellent seeing conditions during the observations on Mar. 22 (~0.7") allow
us to investigate some details of the field objects. In particular IDs
(USNO-B1.0) 1335-0213759 and 1335-0213777 seem to be galaxies, and ID
1335-0213724 is a variable star. All above is leaving a few field stars for
calibration.

Deep field photometry for correct calibration would be encouraged.

FROM:    Robert Quimby at U of Texas/ROTSE  

R. M. Quimby, E. S. Rykoff, B. E. Schaefer, T. McKay, and S. A. Yost
report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded
automatically to Swift GRB 050319 (Krimm et al., GCN 3117, GCN 3119)
with the first 5-second exposure beginning Mar 19, 09:31:45.56 UT
(Rykoff et al., GCN 3116), 27.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. The
observing sequence consisted of ten 5-second and ten 20-second images
followed by about 70 60-second exposures before clouds set in. All
images are unfiltered and the average time between exposures was 9.5
seconds.

We measured the afterglow flux in circular apertures relative to our
deepest image, and calibrated the magnitude scale by adopting SDSS
r-band values for our fiducial reference stars. Magnitudes on this
system for our first 5, 20, and 60-second images are given below.

                     Time (UT)    mag   +/-
                    09:31:45.56  16.16  0.17
                    09:34:09.95  17.22  0.20
                    09:39:05.24  17.58  0.18

The afterglow is detected in the first 30 images, and coadding the
later exposures in groups of 5 to 10 also results in detections,
making this one of the best sampled early light curves for any
GRB. The afterglow is well fit by a t^(-alpha) power law with
alpha=0.59 +/- 0.05, consistent with later R band observations
reported in the GCN Circulars (GCNs 3120, 3121, 3124). Continuing this
trend predicts the afterglow is currently brighter than 22nd
magnitude.

No host is present in the SDSS data at the location of the afterglow,
which implies the redshift for this GRB is larger than 0.3. We also
note the IR detection reported by George et al. (GCN 3125) gives a J-R
color of about 7, and could suggest a high-z source. Spectral
observations are encouraged to accurately determine the GRB redshift.

Rykoff et al. (GCN 3116) The V band magnitude is V =
17.5(1).

The UVOT obtained a series of images of this burst with
a variety of integration times. Mid-exposure times,
Delta-T, with respect to the BAT trigger at 09:31:18 UT
are measured in seconds. Observations with the V and B
filters are listed below:

Delta-T	 Exposure(s)  Filter   Mag
   140      100         V      17.5    (Finding Chart)
   380       80         B      18.8
   600       80         V      18.4
  1030      100         B      18.9

  7080      700         V      20.2
 17000      900         B      21.2
 18700      700         V      20.6

No signal was detected in the U band in a total exposure
time of 90s centered approximately 600s after the
trigger with an upper limit of U = 19.

We caution that the absolute magnitude scale is based on
ground calibration and will require confirmation in
flight.

We report on the detection of near infrared afterglow of GRB 050319 using
NICMOS camera coupled with 1.2m telescope of Physical Research Laboratory

The observations  started at 15:41:00 UT on 19 March in J-band filter at
a 4'* 4' field of view shows a probable Infrared candidate at the error
region of optical afterglow candidate (GCN 3116 & 3117). 
We had taken a net fourty minute exposure and the source which was present
in our first 20s frame was found to be faded down to our observational
limits with in 4min (four frames of  each 60s exposure).
Preliminary analysis and on  comparison with two near by stars present in
our field shows that the near infrared afterglow candidate corresponds to
a J-band magnitude ~ 13 at 15:41:20 UT

We observed afterglow candidate of Swift GRB050319  (Rykoff et al.  GCN
3116, Krimm et al. GCN 3117)  with 1.5m telescope of Mt.Maidanak
high-altitude observatory. BR-band images  were taken in two sets of
observation on (UT) March 19, 17:14 --17:58  and 19:18 -- 21:45.  We confirm
a fading afterglow (Yoshioka et al. GCN 3120). Preliminary  photometry
against of USNO-B1.0 Catalog is following:

Mean time  Exposure Filter  Mag.

Mar.19 20:17 1800   B  21.29
Mar.19 20:16 4800   R  20.17

with typical magnitude error of less than 0.10.
B-R at the two epochs marginally indicate color variation which is not
typical for this phase of afterglow.

K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports

 "The error region of GRB 050319 (GCN 3117) was observed by the 
ART 14-inch telescope. BVRcIc imaging started at 2005 March 19, 11:24
UT and 60-s exposure in each filter was repeated.

 By stacking twenty Rc and twenty Ic frames obtained between 11:36 UT
and 13:05 UT (Mean Epoch 12:20 UT), we note an enhancement of
2.3-sigma level at the position of the optical afterglow (GCN
3116). The enhancement in the stacked frame corresponds to 19.6 mag
with reference to USNO-A2.0 red magnitude.

 Combining this magnitude and those reported in GCN 3116 and GCN 3120,
the early optical afterglow of GRB 050319 decays with relatively
shallow power-law index of t^(-0.6)."

on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

Analysis of the full data set for the Swift-BAT GRB 050319  (Krimm,
et al., GCN 3117) yields a fluence of 8 X 10^-7 erg/cm2 in the 15-350 keV
band and a peak flux of 1.7 ph/cm2/sec  (also 15-350 keV).  The photon index
of the 1-s peak spectrum ( starting at T0 +0.36 sec.) is 2.1 +- 0.3
(90% confidence).  The time-averaged spectrum yields a photon index of
2.2 +- 0.2.

The overall measures of burst duration give T90 = 10 +- 2 seconds (including
systematics).

report on behalf of the Swift-BAT and Swift-XRT teams:

At 09:31:18.44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB 050319.  The burst was 37 degrees off the BAT 
boresight.  The spacecraft executed an immediate slew and was on 
target by 09:32:45.53 UT at which time the XRT began taking data in 
Auto State.  On-board software recognized a bright source at location

RA 154.2016d {+10h 16m 48s} (J2000),
Dec  +43.5463d {+43d 32' 47"} (J2000)

We estimate an uncertainty of 7 arcseconds.

The burst lightcurve as seen in the BAT has a single peak with a fast 
rise, exponential decay.  The estimated duration is 15 seconds.  The 
peak count rate is 2,000 counts/second (15-350 KeV)
