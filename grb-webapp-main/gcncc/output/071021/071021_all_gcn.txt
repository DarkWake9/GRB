report on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 6958) with the 
8.2m VLT+FORS2 equipped with the z_Gunn filter (effective wavelength: 
9100 A; FWHM: 1300 A).

In a coadded image totalling 15 min exposure, we see a weak source at 
the coordinates provided by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCNs 6968, 6971).

Our detection would suggest a redshift less than roughly 6.5.

(Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 6958) beginning 258 seconds after the GRB
trigger time (UT 09:41:33).

We detect a fading uncatalogued source at

RA  =  22:42:35.41
Dec = +23:43:08.9

with un uncertainty of 0.7 arcsec on both coordinates. This position
is 11.4 arcsec from the centre of first XRT error circle (Sakamoto et

We measure a magnitude of R = 17.8 +/- 0.3 for a 3x10 seconds coadded
frame, from 258 to 308 seconds after the trigger time. In subsequent
images the source clearly faded.

Magnitudes are calibrated with respect to R2 mag of several nearby
USNO-B1 objects. Observations are still ongoing.

report:

"Following the detection of GRB 071021 by SWIFT (Barthelmy et al. GCNC

Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos

Nevada.
The NIR frames were obtained  starting on 21.872 Oct (i.e. 11.25 hr after
the BAT trigger).

Within the XRT error box (Page et al. GCNC 6963) there seems to be an
indication of a faint source at RA(J2000) = 22:42:34.31  Dec(J2000)=
+23:43:06.5 (+/- 1"). The object seems to be barely detected in the -H
and -K bands, but not in J,  indicating a highly obscured object or a
very high-z (~10) event, supporting in the latter case the SWIFT high-z
indications (Sakamoto et al. GCNC 6967).

A finding chart is available at:

K.L. Page (U Leicester), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) and T. Sakamoto 
(NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed three orbits of Swift-XRT data obtained for GRB 071021 
(Sakamoto et al. GCN Circ. 6958), totalling 1.7 ks of Windowed Timing (WT) 
data and 5.3 ks of Photon Counting (PC) data. Using the PC data we derive 
a refined position of RA, Dec = 340.64311, +23.71808, which is equivalent 
to

RA(J2000)  =  22 42 34.35
Dec(J2000) = +23 43 05.1

with an estimated error radius of 3.9 arcsec (90 percent containment). 
This is 4.8 arcsec from the onboard XRT position given by Sakamoto et al. 
in GCN Circ. 6958). The position is also 15.1 arcsec from the Faulkes 
Telescope South optical candidate (Guidorzi et al., GCN Circ. 6959) and 
therefore not consistent with it.

The X-ray light-curve is initially quite flat, remaining at around 40-50 
count s^-1 until 230 seconds after the trigger. There follows a very steep 
decay, until about 700 seconds post-trigger, when a series of strong 
flares are seen; this behaviour continues into the second orbit, with the 
third orbit showing the afterglow emission has decayed further.

There is spectral evolution during the initial light-curve, although the 
WT data before the steep decay (135-245 seconds) can be modelled as an 
absorbed power-law, with Gamma = 2.12 +/- 0.09 and a total absorbing 
column of NH = (1.8 +/- 0.2)e21 cm^-2, considerably in excess of the 
Galactic value of 4.8e20 cm^-2. The 0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux 
during this time is 1.3e-10 (1.9e-10) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Because of the flaring activity, it is not feasible accurately to predict 
a count-rate at 24 hours.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.

(UC Berkeley), H.-W. Chen (U Chicago), D. L. Starr (UC Berkeley &amp;

"We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6958) with  
PAIRITEL (*) starting at 2007-10-22 04:53 UT in high wind and poor  
seeing conditions at Mt Hopkins, Arizona. In the first 1340 second  
stack, the IR source noted by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 6968/6971) is  
not detected to J=18.35 mag, H=16.87 mag, Ks=16.43 (2.5 sigma upper  
limit). This is not particularly constraining in light of the deep  
Subaru imaging (Terada et al. GCN 6976) at a similar epoch.

  We note that despite the z-band detection (Malesani et al. GCN  
#6972) the very high-redshift hypothesis of Sakamoto et al. (GCN  
6967) is not yet ruled out. In particular, in high z QSO spectra  
there can be some transmitted flux (in the z-band filter  
transmission) through the Lyman-alpha forest between ~8000 Ang and  
8500 Ang (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2006 **) for z &gt; 6.3 sources. So long  
as the redshifted Lyman limit at the redshift of the emitting source  
is blueward of ~8500 Ang, this light would not be entirely  
suppressed. This consideration yields an upper limit:

                         (1 + z_GRB)*912 Ang &lt; 8500 Ang
                                     z_GRB &lt;~ 8.3

  At such redshifts, say z_GRB = 8, all reported long-wavelength  
observations to-date would be naturally accommodated:

  - the deep non-detections at R and i-band (Berger &amp; Covarrubias,  
GCNs 6973,6974), being blueward of 912*[1+z_GRB])
   - the faint detection at z-band (GCN 6972) due transmitted flux  
between 912*[1+z_GRB] = 8200 and 8500 Ang is allowed (as above)
   - the afterglow detections at H and K (GCN 6968; Terada et al. GCN  
6976)
   - the apparent faintness of J-band flux (GCN 6968) relative to H  
and K given the Gunn-Peterson trough would extend to (1 + z_GRB)*1216  
Ang =~ 1.1 micron.

  All of this assumes that the z-band source is not a foreground  
galaxy (in which case a higher-z GRB suggested by Castro-Tirado et  
al. is allowed).  If indeed the GRB originated from z &gt; 7, we would  
expect to see what would resemble emission lines between lam_obs =  
912*[1+z_GRB] and ~8500 Ang, motivating the utility of *optical*  
spectroscopy of this source. Even without spectroscopy, when final  
magnitudes are reported along with filter transmission curves, a full  
SED should be illuminating."

The ABC is an unfiltered camera, with enhanced sensitivity in the red

At 09:41:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071021 (trigger=294974).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 340.636, +23.707 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 42m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 42' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As with most 64 second image triggers,
there is no obvious variation in the count rate light curve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 09:43:44 UT, 130 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA, Dec 340.6445, +23.7185 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 42m 34.6s
   Dec(J2000) =  23d 43' 06.5"
with an uncertainty of 6.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 50 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position,
within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image
was 3.2e-09 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT is still in engineering mode after the gyro restorations, so there
will be no data products for this trigger.

T. Sakamoto (GSFC/UMBC), N. Gehrels (GSFC) and Kim Page (U. Leicester)

We point out that GRB 071021 has several signatures of high redshift.
As pointed out in GCN 6966, it has BAT high-redshift indicators
(Sakamoto et al. 2007 in prep.) as follows:

- long duration T90 = 225 sec
- relatively few (two) significant peaks
- peak flux (1 s) &lt; 1.0 ph/cm2/s
- power-law photon index (1.70) &lt; 2

Since May 2007, only this burst and GRB 071018 (GCN 6933) have
satisfied all four indicators.  GRB 071021 also has an X-ray
afterglow lightcurve with strong late-time flares (GCN 6963; see
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/other/071021_xrtlc.gif) reminiscent 
of high-redshift burst GRB 050904.  It also has optical observations 
without detection (GCN 6961, 6962).

Deep IR observations are strongly encouraged.

P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii), T. Minezaki (IoA, Tokyo), L. Cowie (IfA,
Hawaii), Y. Yoshii (IoA, Tokyo) and Y. Kakazu (IfA, Hawaii) report:

We observed the candidate optical afterglow of GRB071021 (GCN##6968,
6971,6972) with the robotic MAGNUM telescope + MIPS dual-beam imager. 
Some observations were significantly affected by cloud, but images in I,
H and K were obtained through thin clouds.  We do not detect any source
in our images at the candidate afterglow position, to the following 3
sigma limits, derived from the USNO-1B and 2MASS catalogues:

Filter  midtime(UTC)       Exp. time    upper limits
  I     2007-10-22 6.9h    67min         &gt;22.5mag
  H     2007-10-22 7.7h    30min         &gt;20.4mag
  K     2007-10-22 6.1h    33min         &gt;19.8mag

Our K-band upper limit is consistent with the detection of the afterglow
in K band reported by Kawai et al. (GCN 6976; K~21 mag at 2007-10-22
05:38 UTC).

Using the data set from T-239 to T+472 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071021 (trigger #294974)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 6958).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 340.573, 23.764 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 22h 42m 17.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 23d 45' 49" 
with an uncertainty of 3.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a slow rise starting at ~T-30 sec and
peaking around T+85 sec.  The remaining portion of the lightcurve is
consistant with either a low-level constant emission out to ~T+225 sec or
with a decline to background around T+150 sec and then another weak peak
from ~T+180 to ~T+220 sec.  This latter interpretation is consistant with a
small flare in the XRT afterglow lightcurve around T+220 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 225 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-31.4 to T+252.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.70 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+87.32 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

This burst has several characteristics which are typical of high
redshift bursts.  Its duration is long (T90 = 225 sec) with relatively
few (two) significant peaks.  The 1-s peak flux is &lt; 1.0 ph/cm2/s
and the power-law photon index (1.70) is &lt; 2.

EAFON team

The B,V,R band observations for GRB 071021 field with Lulin 1-m
telescope started at 1.38 hours after the burst. No source was found
at XRT position (Sakamoto et al.; GCN 6958) and optical candidate
position (Guidorzi et al.; GCN 6959) in our combined images. The
R-band limiting magnitude, compared with several USNOB stars, is about
20.4 at 1.87 hours after the burst . This result suggests that the
fading optical source reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 6959) is the
optical afterglow of GRB 071021.

G. Chincarini (U.Bicocca), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), F. Fiore (INAF/OAR),
D. Fugazza (INAF/OABr), L. Stella (INAF/OAR), report on behalf of the
MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 6958) with the
8.2m VLT+FORS2 equipped with the R filter (effective wavelength:
6550 A; FWHM: 1650 A).

An eight-minute exposure was obtained on Oct 22.06688 , and a second,
thirty-minute exposure, on Oct 22.99604. A weak source is detected in
both images at the position of the candidate afterglow provided by
Castro-Tirado et al. (GCNs 6968, 6971).

The object has not faded significantly between both epochs, although
the very low S/N (~2) in the first image does not allow for a strong
statement regarding its variability.

Combining our own data and all the available optical-NIR data (GCNs
6962, 6973, 6974, 6975, 6976, 6980, 6983) we have measured a
photometric redshift z~5, but with a 2-sigma confidence interval that
includes all values in the z=[0 ... 5.5] range.

An alternative explanation for all the available data is that of a
strongly reddened afterglow (detected as a fading source in the H- and
K-band images), having taken place in a galaxy at a significantly
lower redshift (detected in our deeper, bluer, R- and z-band
images). This model should be checked via spectroscopy of the putative
host galaxy.

Our R-band images and the results of the preliminary photometric
redshift analysis are posted at:
