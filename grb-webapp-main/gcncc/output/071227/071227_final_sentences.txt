"We obtained three 900-s spectra of the candidate host galaxy of GRB 
071227 (GCNs 7150,7151) with IMACS on the Magellan/Baade telescope.  We 
find the same emission line noted by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 7152), as well 
as a second emission line which corresponds to [OIII]5006 at the same 
redshift.  From preliminary wavelength calibration we find z=0.384.  If 
this is the host galaxy of GRB 071227, the observed fluence of 2.2e-7 
erg/cm^2 (GCN 7148) translates to an isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy 
of 8e49 erg, typical of previous short GRBs."

This position is 4.5 arcsec from the XRT position.
The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.01 mag in the

We observed the field of GRB 071227 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 7147; Sato et 
al. GCN 7148) with the ESO-VLT equipped with the FORS2 camera. A 
spectrum (grism 300V) of the galaxy inside the XRT error box (Cucchiara 
&amp; Sakamoto GCN 7150; Berger et al. GCN 7151) taken on Dec 28.1885 (about 
8.3 hours after the burst) displays an emission line at 5154.77 A. 
Interpreting this feature as [O II] 3728 we infer a tentative redshift 
of z = 0.383 (based on a preliminary wavelength calibration).

The XRT began observing the field at 20:15:06 UT, 79 seconds after the
BAT trigger. From prompt downlinked data, XRT found a  variable, uncatalogued 
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 58.1316, -55.9833 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 52h 31.58s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 58' 59.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 112 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position,
within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image
was 9.6e-10 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 
UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 86 seconds after the BAT trigger, and a
second finding chart of 400 seconds in V starting 192 seconds after
the trigger. No afterglow candidate has been found in the initial
data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error
circle. The 3-sigma upper limit at the XRT position is 19.9 mag in
White, 19.0 in V. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is
typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) = 0.01.

Using the data set from T-120 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071227 (trigger #299787)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 7147).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 58.132, -55.959 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 3h 52m 31.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 57' 32" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.
 
The mask weighted light curve shows multiple peaks during ~2 sec 
duration of the burst.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.8 +- 0.4 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).  Therefore, this burst might be
classified as a short burst.  Additional BAT analysis (e.g. spectral
lag) is on-going, and will be presented later.  
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+1.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.99 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.09 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.

The Swift-XRT began observing GRB 071227 (trigger #299787) at
20:15:04UT, 79.5 seconds after the BAT trigger (Sakamoto et al., GCN
Circ. 7147). Using 382 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and
UVOT V-band data, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position
(using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the
USNO-B1 catalogue) of RA, Dec = 58.13002, -55.98419, which is equivalent 
to:
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is
4.5 arcsec away from the position derived from the promptly downlinked
XRT data reported in Sakamoto et al. (GCN Circ. 7147), 91 arcsec from
the refined BAT position of Sato et al. (GCN Circ. 7148) and 2.6 arcsec
from the possible UVOT optical transient reported by Cucchiara and 
Sakamoto (GCN Circ. 7150).
The XRT light curve from 210s to 34.8ks after the BAT trigger can be
modelled by a doubly broken power-law, with parameters alpha1 = 1.1
+/- 0.2, tbreak1 = 183 +/- 7s, alpha2 = 5.3 +1.2 -0.6, tbreak2 = 389
+/- 65s, alpha3 = 1.1 +/- 0.2.
The XRT spectrum from a time interval spanning 104s to 208s after the
BAT trigger is well fit by an absorbed power-law, with a photon index
of 1.62+/-0.14 and a column density (9.3+/-4.3)e20 cm^-2, in addition
to the Galactic column of 2.6e20 cm^-2 in this direction. The observed
(unabsorbed) 0.3-10.0 keV flux from this period is 3.9e-10 (4.6e-10)
ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a duration (T90) of about 1.5 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was (1.3 Â± 0.2)*10^-6 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0-1s was
2.1 (+0.1, -0.1) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.
Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-1s to
T0+1s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 1.2 (+0.2, -0.2) (chi^2/d.o.f = 18.5/17).
