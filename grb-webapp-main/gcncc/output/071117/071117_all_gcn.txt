C. Guidorzi, P. Romano (Univ. Bicocca &amp; INAF-OAB),
A. Moretti (INAF-OAB) and T.N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU),
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We recalculated the XRT refined position of GRB 071117
(trigger=296805, Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 7098)
by excluding the first orbit data, which were affected
by the presence of a dead pixel column.
In 8.3 ks of Photon Counting mode data spanning 8.7-28 ks after
the trigger the position of the X-ray afterglow is
RA,Dec =335.04336,-63.44278 degrees, which corresponds to

RA(J2000) =  22 20 10.41
Dec(J2000)= -63 26 34.0

with error circle of radius 3.8 arcsec (90%, including
boresight uncertainties). The optical afterglow reported by
Bloom et al. (GCN Circ. 7110) now lies 1.5" away from the new
XRT centroid.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.

Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071117 (trigger #296805)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 7098).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 335.026, -63.442 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 20m 06.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 26' 31" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like peak starting
at ~T-0.5 sec, peaking at ~T+0.5 sec, and decaying away out to ~T+15 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.6 +- 1.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.4 to T+13.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 11.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.

P. Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire), J.P.U. Fynbo, D. Malesani 
(DARK/NBI), N.R. Tanvir (Univ. Leicester), B. Milvang-Jensen (DARK/NBI), 
A.O. Jaunsen (Univ. Oslo), P.M. Vreeswijk, J. Hjorth (DARK/NBI), report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071117 (Ukwatta et al., GCN 7098) with the 
ESO VLT, starting on 2007 Nov 18.005 UT (9.28 hr after the GRB). We 
clearly detect the two sources indicated by Bloom (GCNs 7105, 7110), 
including the afterglow s2. Source s1 appears extended in our images, 
while source s2 is indeed pointlike (seeing 0.85"). A faint nebulosity 
is apparent surrounding both objects.

A VLT spectrum was obtained with the FORS1 instrument starting on 2007 
Nov 18.03 UT, placing both sources on the slit. Three exposures of 30 
min each were secured. The afterglow spectrum shows a faint, blue 
continuum between 3700 to 9000 A, and a weak emission line is apparent 
at 8688 A. Interpreting this as [OII], we infer a redshift of z=1.331, 
which we consider as the likely redshift of the GRB. Interpreting the 
observed line as [OIII] or Halpha, we would expect to detect [OII] at 
6466 or 4934 A, respectively, which we do not see. A more conservative 
upper limit to the GRB redshift comes from the nondetection of any 
dropout in the blue down to 3800 A, which implies z &lt; 2.1.

The spectrum of s1 is very red, with no significant flux below 5000 A. A 
plot of the 2D spectrum and a finding chart showing the afterglow and 
the various XRT error circles is posted at:

Konus-A teams report:

The GRB 071117 (Swift-BAT trigger #296805:
Ukwatta et al., GCN 7098; Krimm et al., GCN 7102) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=53404.535 s UT (14:50:04.535).
This burst also triggered Konus-A at T0=53408.587 s UT (14:50:08.587).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse with a 
duration of ~5 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 5.84(-2.40, +0.30)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.160 s
of 6.66(-2.95, +1.13)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).
The burst shows strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution.

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 1.53(-0.16, +0.15)
and Ep = 278 (-79, +236) keV (chi2 = 37.5/52 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

program GS-2007B-Q-2  (PI = H.-W. Chen). Starting at 2007 Nov 18

The uncertainty is 350 mas in each coordinate (relative to USNO  
B1.0). This source, s1, is roughly R=23.3 mag at the time of  
observation (based upon the USNO B.10 catalog magnitude of the source  
at 22:20:13.33 -63:26:32.9).  There is another source straddling the

southeast at:

   s2:   ra= 22:20:10.42  dec = -63:26:35.5 (J2000)

Further observations will be required to determine if either of these

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 071117 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 296805) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 9.5h after the GRB trigger
(GRB occured during daytime). The elevation of the field
decreased from from 54 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were excellents.

We co-added series of exposures taken in VRI filters
from t_trig+9.5h to t_trig+11.3h. There is no OT detected in
V and R bands. A source is detected in the I-band
close to the limiting magnitude I~20 at a position
compatible with XRT (Romano et al. GCNC 7100) and
s1,s2 sources of Bloom (GCNC 7105). Due to the spatial
sampling of TAROT (3.3arcsec/pixel) and to the very low
signal to noise ratio we cannot discriminate
between s1 and s2.

The source is also present in I-band in series
11.6-13.3 h and also in the series 13.7-15.8 h but
the actual processing does not allow to say if the
brightness decreases or not.

If we consider the I-band source TAROT is the same as the
s1 source of Bloom (R=23.3), the corresponding (R-I)~3
is very high. The galactic extinction in R band is only 0.06
magnitude (estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998).
As a consequence, we estimate that GRB 071117 is a good
high redshift candidate (z&gt;4.5).

report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 14:50:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071117 (trigger=296805).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst due to an Earth constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 335.020, -63.441 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 20m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 26' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single FRED
peak with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~16000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT data products
to analyze.  NFI observations are expected at T+43 minutes, when it comes
out of constraint. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see

Swift XRT observed the GRB 071117 (trigger=296805, Ukwatta et al., GCN
Circ. 7098) beginning 2.8 ks after the BAT trigger.
In 4.4 ks of Photon Counting mode data spanning 2.8-14.7 ks after
the trigger the position of the X-ray afterglow is
RA,Dec =335.04579,-63.44278 degrees, which corresponds to

RA(J2000) =  22 20 10.99
Dec(J2000)= -63 26 34.0

with error circle of radius 3.8 arcsec (90%, including
boresight uncertainties). This lies 3.6 arcsec from the previous
XRT position (Romano et al., GCN Circ. 7100) and 32 arcsec from
the BAT refined position (Krimm et al., GCN Circ 7102).

The X-ray light curve can be fit by a power law from
T+2.8ks to T+14.7ks, with a decay index of 0.8 +/- 0.2.

The Photon Counting spectrum can modelled with an absorbed power-law, with
a photon index of 2.2 +0.4/-0.3 and a total absorbing column of NH = (2.3
+0.9/-0.8) e21 cm-2. The Galactic value is 2.3e20 cm-2 in the direction
of the burst. The 0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux during this time
is 3.0e-12 (5.0e-12) erg cm-2 s-1. Uncertainties are given at 90% 
confidence.

Assuming the source continues to decay with the same rate,
we predict an XRT count rate of 1.3e-2 counts/s at T+24 hours, which
corresponds to an observed 0.3-10keV flux of 7.8e-13 ergs cm-2 s-1.
