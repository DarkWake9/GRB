W. Li and A. V. Filippenko, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf
of the KAIT GRB team, report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080129 detected by Swift (trigger 301981;
Immler et al. GCN 7226) with the robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging
Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory. The automatic sequence was not 
executed due to poor weather, but a manual sequence was observed remotely.
In total, 14 x 20 s  unfiltered observations were observed. Our first 20 s
image started at 6:11:31 UT, 286 s after the GRB trigger. We did not detect 
the optical/NIR afterglow candidate reported by Bloom (GCN 7229) and
Kruehler et al. (GCN 7231) to a limiting magnitude of 17.9 (calibrated to 
USNO B1). A 200 s co-added image with the middle exposure time at 643 s 
after the GRB trigger did not detect the afterglow candidate to a limiting
magnitude of 20.0.

collaboration:

"Automatically triggering off of the original GCN/SWIFT_BAT_POSITION  
notice for GRB 080129 (GCN 7226), we observed the field with Gemini  
South + GMOS in the r-band starting at 06:50:21.4 2008-01-29 in a  
series of 5 dithered exposures of 5 minutes apiece. Consistent with  
the position of the X-ray source (GCN 7228) we find a point-like  
object at:

     07:01:08.20  -07:50:46.3  (J2000)

(preliminary uncertainty of 300 mas rms relative to 2MASS). We suggest  
that this is the optical afterglow of GRB 080129 but cannot confirm  
variability at this time. More observations are encouraged."

We thank the Gemini Staff for conducting these observations.

M. Perri (ASDC), G. Stratta (ASDC) and D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing the possible GRB 080129 (trigger #301981,
Immler et al., GCN Circ. 7226) at 07:00:08 UT, about 53 min after the
BAT trigger.

Analysis of prompt downlinked data finds an uncataloged X-ray source
located at RA, Dec 105.2848, -7.8463 which is
   RA(J2000) = 07 01 8.35
   Dec(J2000) = -07 50 46.8
with an uncertainty of 3.3 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This location
is 71 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within the BAT error
circle (Immler et al., GCN Circ 7226). Further analysis will be
reported in a subsequent circular.

FROM:    Daniel Perley at U.C. Berkeley  <dperley@astro.berkeley.edu>

D. A. Perley and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of the 
GRAASP collaboration:

Preliminary photometry of our first series of r-band observations of the 
candidate afterglow of GRB 080129 (Immler et al., GCN 7226; Bloom, 7229) 
yields the following magnitudes, calibrated using three DSS stars*:

t=44 min: R = 22.93 +/- 0.06
t=50 min: R = 22.86 +/- 0.05
t=56 min: R = 22.78 +/- 0.04
t=62 min: R = 22.56 +/- 0.04
t=68 min: R = 22.87 +/- 0.05

As these magnitudes are approximately consistent with the value reported 
by Kruehler et al. (GCN 7231/7232) we do not confirm general fading 
behavior of this source over the interval of our observations. 
However, we note that the fourth exposure shows statistically 
significant evidence of a short-lived rebrightening.  While an 
instrumental cause has not been ruled out, given the location in the 
Galactic plane of the source and the very slow fading reported by 
Kruehler et al. (0.5 mag from 4 to ~94 minutes, atypical of extragalactic 
GRBs), it is possible that the GRB may be an analog of GRB 070610 / 
SWIFT J195509.6+261406 (Pagani et al., GCN 6489; Kasliwal et al. 2007, 
arXiv:0708.0226), which showed extensive short-time scale early-time 
variability above a nearly-constant baseline.  Further observations 
(including rapid-time-series optical observations), and further analysis 
of the X-ray afterglow, are encouraged to further investigate the nature 
of this source.

Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080129 (trigger #301981)
(Immler, et al., GCN Circ. 7226).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 105.297, -7.840 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 01m 11.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -7d 50' 24" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single broad peak starting at ~T-20 sec,
peaking at ~T+20, and ending at ~T+50.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 48 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.0 to T+49.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.9 +- 1.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+24.50 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.2 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

The majority of the indicators say this is a GRB, but at this time
we can not rule out a galactic source explanation for this trigger.

Decl. (2000.0) = -07d 50' 47'

G. Stratta (ASDC), M. Perri (ASDC) and D. N. Burrows (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT began observing GRB 080129 (trigger=301981) on
2008-01-29 at 07:00:17 UT, 53 minutes after the BAT trigger
(Immler et al., GCN Circ. 7226).

Using 2045 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
v-band data for GRB 080129, we find a refined astrometrically
corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and
matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec =  105.284125, -7.846722 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 07h 01m 8.19s
Dec (J2000): -07d 50' 48.2"

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
This is 1.2 arcsec away from the previous position derived from the
XRT and UVOT data reported in Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 7230),
51 arcsec from the refined BAT position of Barthelmy et al.
(GCN Circ. 7235) and 1.9 arcsec from the Gemini South position
(GCN Circ. 7229).

The X-ray light curve from T + 3.2 ks to T + 85.8 ks can be
fitted by a broken power law model (chi2 of 39 for 28 degrees
of freedom) with a temporal break at about T + 15.5 ks and
decay indices alpha1 = 0.6 +/- 0.1 and alpha2 = 1.5 +/- 0.1
before and after the break, respectively.

The 0.3-10 keV spectrum from T + 3.2 ks to T + 32.2 ks
is well fit by an absorbed power law
(reduced chi2 of 1.02, with 20 degrees of freedom).
The best fit photon index is 2.0 +/- 0.1, with an hydrogen column
density of (2 +/- 1)e21 cm^-2, in addition to the Galactic column along
the line of sight of 6.3e21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).
The observed (unabsorbed) flux in the 0.3-10 keV band is
4.2e-12 (8.5e-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

The timing and spectral behaviors are completely consistent
with those of a typical GRB X-ray afterglow,
removing any uncertainty about the nature of this burst.

The predicted XRT count rate 48 hours after the trigger is 1.6e-3
count s^-1, which corresponds to an observed 0.3-10.0 keV flux of
1.3e-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

(trigger 301981) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 352.7s after the GRB trigger
(270.9s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
from 42 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-01-29T06:06:45.216

The fiirst image is 90.0s exposure in tracking mode.
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+352.7s to t0+442.7s : R &gt; 16.4

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+448.5s to t0+1039.0s : R &gt; 18.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=220.9983 lat= -1.4244
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 9 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.

D. Perez (U Leicester), M. Perri (ASDC), M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) and
G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:06:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible GRB 080129 (trigger=301981). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 105.280, -7.827 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 01m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 49' 35"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve for this event appears
to show a duration of about 80 sec with a peak of ~600 counts/sec 
(15-350 keV), at ~30 sec after the trigger although, as is usual
for image triggers, the TDRSS light curve is noisy. 
The location of the source, 1.4 degrees from the Galactic plane
raises the possibility that this is a Galactic transient. 
Further analysis will require the downlinked data from Malindi. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze.  Swift will slew to this position at about T+3006 s, or 
about 06:56 UT. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Immler (immler AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)

SUBJECT: GRB 080129: Swift/UVOT Refined Upper Limits
DATE:    08/01/31 13:12:48 GMT
FROM:    Stephen Holland at USRA/NASA/GSFC/SSC  <sholland@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov>

S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and S. Immler (CRESST/UMCP/GSFC)
report on the behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

        The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080129 starting 3188 s
after the BAT trigger (Immler et al. 2007, GCN Circ. 7226).  We do not
find any source, in any of the UVOT observations, at the location of
the Gemini-South source (Bloom, 2007 GCN Circ. 7229).

        The 3-sigma upper limits for detecting a source at this
location in the co-added images are:


Filter    T_start   T_stop    Exp(s)    Mag (3-sigma upper limit)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    v         3188   21,457      2023    21.3
    b         4134   28,152      2164    22.2
    u         3929   27,239      1278    21.5
  uvw1        3724   32,166      1182    21.3
  uvm2        3519   22,362      1279    21.2
  uvw2        4545   17,372      1920    21.7
white        3207   28,940      2856    23.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This burst occurred 1.43 degrees from the Galactic plane, so the
Galactic reddening along the line of sight is highly uncertain.  The
values quoted above are not corrected for Galactic extinction.  All
photometry is on the UVOT flight system described in Poole et al.  
(2008).
