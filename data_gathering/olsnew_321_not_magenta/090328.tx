Notes.
a UT at the beginning of exposure.
b Time from midpoint of exposure to Fermi-GBM trigger.
c Reported magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction (E(B − V ) = 0.057 mag; Schlegel et al. 1998). Observations in the
U band are referenced to Vega, while all other filters are reported on the AB magnitude system (Oke & Gunn 1983).

TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  9048
SUBJECT: GRB 090328: Swift UVOT observations
DATE:    09/03/29 15:11:20 GMT
FROM:    Samantha Oates at MSSL  <sro@mssl.ucl.ac.uk

S. R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 090328 16 hrs
after the Fermi LAT trigger (McEnery et al., GCN 9044). We detect
a candidate optical afterglow in the u and white filters at:

RA(J2000.0)  = 06:02:39.67
DEC(J2000.0) = -41:52:54.5

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
At the moment we are unable to tell if the source is fading, further
observations have been performed, but due to a data gap, the data
is currently unavaliable.

Preliminary magnitudes for the white and u filters are:

Filter    T_mid (hrs)  Exposure(s)       Mag  Err
------------------------------------------------------------
u         16.0         793           19.04 +/- 0.13
white     16.1         173           19.56 +/- 0.14

The above magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
corresponding to a reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.06 mag (Schlegel et al.,
1998, ApJS, 500, 525).  The photometry is on the UVOT flight system
described in Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383,627).

TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  9054
SUBJECT: GRB 090328: GROND Detection of the Optical/NIR Afterglow
DATE:    09/03/30 03:36:16 GMT
FROM:    Adria C. Updike at Clemson U  <aupdike@clemson.edu

Adria Updike (Clemson University), Sylvio Klose (Tautenburg Obs.),
Christian Clemens and Jochen Greiner (MPE Garching) report on behalf of
the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 090328 (Fermi trigger 259925808; McEnergy et
al., GCN 9044) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al.
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 23:24 UT on date, about 1.6 days after the GRB
trigger, and are continuing. They were performed at an average seeing of
1.8" and at an average airmass of 1.06.

We detect the afterglow reported by Kennea et al. (GCN 9045) in all bands.

Based on the first 8 min of total exposures in g'r'i'z' JHK, we estimate
preliminary magnitudes (all in AB system) of

g' = 20.97 +/- 0.05 mag,

r' = 20.23 +/- 0.03 mag,

i' = 19.89 +/- 0.04 mag,

z' = 19.54 +/- 0.03 mag,

J = 19.54 +/- 0.06 mag,

H = 19.02 +/- 0.06 mag and

K = 18.52 +/- 0.08 mag

Given magnitudes are calibrated against USNO as well as 2MASS field stars
and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction
corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.06 mag in the direction of the
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
