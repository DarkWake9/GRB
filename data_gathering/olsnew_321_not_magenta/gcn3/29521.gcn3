on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 23:25:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210217A (trigger=1033264).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 97.610, +68.715 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 30m 26s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 42' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:27:20.1 UT, 97.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 97.58675, 68.72497 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 06h 30m 20.82s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 43' 29.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 47 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 8.69
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 103 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	06:30:19.93 =  97.58305
  DEC(J2000) = +68:43:30.6  =  68.72516
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.63 arc sec. This position is 6.2
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
18.72 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.15. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.103.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
