The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:44:26 UT on 4 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191104C (trigger 594557071.308326 / 191104448).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 289.4, Dec = 22.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 17m, 22d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53.0 degrees.
