E. Semkov (Institute of Astronomy, Sofia, Bulgaria) report:
 
The afterglow of the HETE burst (H10893) GRB 030226 (Fox et al., GCN 1879;
Price et al., GCN 1880) was observed with the 2m RCC telescope of the

x 300 sec coo-added exposures.
We used A and B stars from Garnavich et al. (GCN 1885) as a references.
We estimate the brightness of the optical afterglow in R band as follows.

26 (UT 22.2) R=20.27 +/-0.1
27 (UT 01.2) R=20.4  +/-0.15
27 (UT 21.3) R=21.3  +/-0.3
