At 12:15:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060708 (trigger=217805).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 7.798, -33.730 {00h 31m 12s, -33d 43' 46"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single, roughly
triangular peak structure with a duration of ~12 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:17:01 UT, 62 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright and fading X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) =  00 31 13.50, Dec(J2000) = -33 45 33.8, with an
estimated uncertainty of 4.1 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). 
This location is 103 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within
the BAT error circle and it is 4.6" from the UVOT candidate (see below). 
The initial flux in the 2.5s image was 3.4e-09 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 72 seconds after the BAT trigger.  There
is a candidate afterglow in the list of sources generated on-board at
(RA,DEC) (J2000) of (7.8077,-33.7590) or (00h31m13.85s,-33o45'32.4") 
with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5 arcsec.  This position is
4.5 arcsec from the center of the XRT error circle.  The estimated
magnitude is 17.4 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.5 mag. 
No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.01.
