The long-duration GRB 130605A
(Swift-BAT trigger 557508: Holland, et al., GCN 14773;
Barthelmy, et al., GCN 14787)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=85303.441s UT (23:41:43.441)

The burst light curve shows a single pulse from ~T0-1 s to ~T0+5 s.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB130606_T85303/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (3.4 ± 0.4)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.320 s,
of (2.5 ± 0.3)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.128 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by a simple power-law
model with the photon index 2.19 ± 0.07, chi2 = 80/69 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
