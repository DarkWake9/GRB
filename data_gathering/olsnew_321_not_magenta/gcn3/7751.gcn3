The bright GRB 080514B localized by SuperAGILE/IPN (Rapisarda et al., 
GCN 7715) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=35758.672 s UT (09:55:58.672).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a duration of
~7 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.23(-0.26, +0.27)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+3.328 s
of (2.07 +/- 0.43)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+12.032 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV-5 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.599(-0.134, +0.161),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.48(-0.25, +0.18),
the peak energy Ep = 224 (-22, +23) keV (chi2 = 72.3/76 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
