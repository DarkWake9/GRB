D. Xu (NAOC/CAS) reports on behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160203A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 18979) using 
the LCOGT-1m located at Cerro Tololo. Observations started at 02:35:09 
UT on 2016-02-03 (i.e., 1319 s after the BAT trigger) and 10x150s R-band 
frames were obtained.

We detect an uncatalogued and decaying source at the position reported 
by Kruehler et al. (GCN 18980), which has m(R)= 18.04 in the first 150s 
exposure, calibrated with the nearby USNN star, #0651-0249724 
(R1=R2=16.84 mag). The fading nature confirms the source is the 
afterglow of GRB 160203A.
