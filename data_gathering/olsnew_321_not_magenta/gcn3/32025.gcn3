The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:03:55 UT on 12 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220512A (trigger 674024640.16888 / 220512211).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 128.6, Dec = 84.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 34m, 84d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118.0 degrees.
