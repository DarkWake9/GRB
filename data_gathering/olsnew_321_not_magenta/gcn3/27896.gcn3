The long GRB 200530A (Fermi GBM Localization: the Fermi GBM team,
GCN Circ. 27861; AstroSat CZTI detection: Gupta et al., GCN Circ. 27864;
Fermi-LAT detection: Longo et al., GCN Circ. 27891;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200530A.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:44:15.067 UTC on 30 May 2020.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script, the GCN
notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at
T-2.9 sec, peaks at T+5.6 sec and ends at T+21.1 sec. The T90 and T50
durations measured by the SGM data are 19.7 +- 2.0 sec and 9.5 +- 0.9 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
