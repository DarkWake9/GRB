behalf of the Swift Team:

Beginning at 14:45:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 
triggered and located a point source in a 27 minute image. 
Swift slewed immediately to the source at the location of the 
known gamma-ray transient IGR J08408-4503 (ATel 813; Gotz et al.)
= V* LM Vel (ATel 818; Kennea et al.). The BAT
on-board calculated  location is  RA,Dec 130.214, -45.063 
{08h 40m 51s, -45d 03' 44"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin 
(radius, 90% containment, including  systematic uncertainty). 
As is typical for long image triggers, the BAT light curve 
shows no obvious variation attributable to the source. 

The XRT began observing the field at 15:17:07 UT, 1885 seconds after the
BAT trigger (which is at the beginning of the 27 minute discovery image). 
XRT found a bright X-ray source located at 
RA(J2000) = 08h 40m 47.3s, Dec(J2000) = -45d 03' 29.5", with an
estimated uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds (90% confidence radius,
including boresight uncertainties).  This location is 46 arcseconds 
from the BAT on-board position, within the BAT error circle. 
It is 5.2 arcseconds from the pulsating star V* LM Vel. 
The initial flux in the 2.5s image was about 1e-9 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV).  
No obvious variability is seen in the quick-look light curve. 

Due to the presence of bright stars in the field of view, the UVOT was unable to observe.
