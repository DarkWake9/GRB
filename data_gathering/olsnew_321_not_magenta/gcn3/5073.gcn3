A.Yoshida (AGU) report:

After the previous report (GCN 5065), we carried out
further photometric calibrations for the observations
of the GRB 060502B field (Troja et al. GCN 5055, GCN 5059).
We have taken 100 frames of R band image with 20s exposure
each and photometric calibration was mede by every 20 frames
by comparing with USNO A2.0 stars in the same field.
The 3 sigma limiting magnitude of each combined image
is as below.
