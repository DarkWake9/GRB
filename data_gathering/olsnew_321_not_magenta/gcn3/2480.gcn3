report:

Konus-Wind and HETE (FREGATE and WXM)  observed this GRB at
21537 seconds.  Its duration was approximately 9 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA,
Decl(2000)= 76.207, 18.592 degrees, with radius 56.016 +/-  1.739
degrees (3 sigma).

GRB031203B was detected by HETE as trigger H2949.  The burst was
detected just a few seconds before the end of orbital science
operations, when the optical aspect was not available.  It was observed
by the WXM X-camera, but not by the Y camera.  This event has a hard
spectrum (Epeak ~ 160 keV) and a 30-400 keV fluence of 8E-6 erg/cm2.
The  HETE localization is a circle of 10 degree radius centered at RA,
Decl(2000)=133.41, +53.22 degrees.

The IPN annulus intersects this circle at four points to form an error
box whose area is approximately 69 sq. degrees.  The intersection
points are:

RA(2000)  DEC(2000)
134.252   43.235
123.689   61.775
130.660   63.116
138.978   43.915

A map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/031203B.  HETE
lightcurves and the results of automated spectral analyses can be found
on the HETE web page http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/GRB031203b. 
This localization may be improved, but a small error box cannot
be determined for this event.
