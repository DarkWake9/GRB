Montanari (Univ.Ferrara) and M. Della Valle (INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di 
Arcetri) report:

"Based on the redshift of 1.314 (GCN 5826) and the fluence and spectral 
properties of the prompt emission as measured by Konus-Wind (GCN 5837) and 
RHESSI (GCN 5838), we estimate for GRB 061121 a total isotropic released 
energy, Eiso, of ~(3+/-0.3)x10^(53) erg (1-10000 keV cosmological 
rest-frame, H0=65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7) and an 
intrinsic peak energy, Ep,i, of ~1200+/-400 keV. These values are 
consistent with the best fit of the Ep,i-Eiso correlation within ~0.9 - 
2.3 sigma (see, e.g., Figure 1 of Amati et al. 2006, astro-ph/0607148v4).

Given that the Konus-Wind and RHESSI spectra were measured during the 
brighter and harder portion of the event (~20s), the inclusion in the 
spectral analysis of the BAT and XRT data covering the whole prompt 
emission (i.e. up to ~120 s from the Swift trigger, see GCN Report 15.1) 
may provide a lower value of Ep,i and a slightly higher value of 
Eiso, improving the match with the Ep,i-Eiso correlation."
