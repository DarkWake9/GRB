R. Wark (CSIRO), M. Wieringa (CSIRO), D. A. Frail (NRAO) and
S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Beginning at 7:39 UT on 1999 February 18 we observed a region
covering the WFC error circle of GRB 990217 (GCN #258, IAU Circ 7710)
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 4.8 GHz and 8.6
GHz.  The total observing time was 3.6 hours.

Within a 3 arcmin radius around the GRB position no radio sources were
detected down to 0.28 mJy (5 sigma) at either frequency. Deeper ATCA
observations are planned for this week."
