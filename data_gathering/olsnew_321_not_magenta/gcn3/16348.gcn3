V. D'Elia (ASDC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have observed again the field of the Fermi GRB 140523A (von Kienlin  
and Connaughton, GCN 16321; Vianello et al. GCN 16322), to search for  
variability of the X-ray afterglow candidates.
In the 5 ks of XRT data acquired, starting on 2014-05-31 at 02:33:06  
UT (i.e., ~ 8 days after the burst), all X-ray candidates are still  
detected with no hint of afterglow-like variability behavior.
We thus conclude that none of the candidate sources is the X-ray  
afterglow of GRB 140523A.
