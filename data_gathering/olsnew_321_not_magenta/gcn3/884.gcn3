B. Altieri, N. Schartel, D. Lumb (XMM-Newton), L. Piro (IAS/CNR),
A. Parmar (SSD/ESA) report:

analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of GRB001025
(Altieri et al. GCN 869) based on the final attitude
reconstruction shows the presence of 2 sources
in the IPN/RXTE error box (Hurley et al. GCN864):

S1 (J2000): R.A. =  8h36m35.92s   Decl. =  -13 04' 09.9"
S2 (J2000): R.A. =  8h36m27.24s   Decl. =  -13 03' 41.5"

The error is expected to be less than 10".

Seven objects in the field of view of the X-ray cameras
(30 arcminute diameter) appear to be the counterpart of
sources in the USNO-A2.0 catalogue. They show position
coincidences better than 7 arcsec for the positions
obtained from the EPIC-MOS images and better than
4 arcsec for the positions obtained from the EPIC-pn
image, respectively.
