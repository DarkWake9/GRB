Dong Xu (DARK/NBI) reports

The Swift/BAT data were reduced in a standard way. Making use of the
Cross Correlation Function (CCF) for different energy bands over 15-150
keV, we found negligible spectral time lags, being consistent with the
values/range of previous Swift short-duration GRBs. Also we note the
rest-frame energy band which BAT corresponds to for this burst (z~6.7,
Fynbo et al. GCN 8225) is higher than that for previous GRBs.

DX is grateful to R. L. C. Starling, P. T. O'Brien, and K. Page through
the SPARTAN program on Swift data reduction.
