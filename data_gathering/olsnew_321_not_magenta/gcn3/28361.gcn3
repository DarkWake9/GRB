The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:38:58 UT on 3 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200903C (trigger 620861943.576056 / 200903902).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 9.8, Dec = -2.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 39m, -2d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 85.0 degrees.
