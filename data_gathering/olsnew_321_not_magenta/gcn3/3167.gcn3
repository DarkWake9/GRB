The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observing the field 
of GRB 050402 at 06:12:01.6 UT, approximately 125 seconds after the BAT 
trigger.  The first image was sent down via the TDRSS link approximately 
300 seconds after the trigger.  This image was a 100 second exposure taken 
with the V filter.  It was centred on the BAT position, and had a size of 
5 x 5 arcminutes, which covered 88% of the BAT error circle. The image was 
binned 8 x 8 to reduce the bandwidth required for transmission.  A 
comparison against the DSS showed no new sources down to a 5-sigma 
limiting magnitude of approximately V = 18.84 +/- 0.09 , based on 
preliminary in-orbit zero points.
