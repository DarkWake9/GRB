Page report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 201221D (Page et al. GCN
Circ. 29112), from 96 s to 23.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for
this burst was given by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 29113). The source is
fading with alpha >0.4.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01014037.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
