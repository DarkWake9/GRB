S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 12:49:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located V404 Cyg (trigger=646721).  Swift was already observing this location
because of a TOO commanded upload.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 306.006, +33.868 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 24m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 52' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  We are not reporting a light curve due to a loss
of a data packet in the TDRSS real-time.
