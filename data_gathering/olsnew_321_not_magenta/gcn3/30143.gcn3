and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The bright, short-duration GRB 210605A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 30127)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 644562543), Konus-Wind,
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT) at about 18538 s UT (05:08:58).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    21.609 (01h 26m 26s) -45.089 (-45d 05' 19")
  Corners:
    24.666 (01h 38m 40s) -49.385 (-49d 23' 08")
    19.468 (01h 17m 52s) -41.356 (-41d 21' 22")
    19.355 (01h 17m 25s) -41.513 (-41d 30' 47")
    24.633 (01h 38m 32s) -49.663 (-49d 39' 47")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.2 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 9.0 deg (the minimum one is 8.4 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 81 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi RoboBA and BALROG localizations.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
