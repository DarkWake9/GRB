We obtained spectroscopy of ZTF19acykzsk/AT2019wqj, reported by Andreoni et
al. (GCN #26424) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS-N)
mounted on the Gemini-North 8-meter telescope on Mauna Kea. We combined six
450 second exposures using the R400+_G5305 grating starting 2019-12-14
11:18 UTC at an airmass of 1.9. A prominent broad H emission feature is
seen in the spectrum consistent with a SN II at z=0.02, same redshift of
the closest galaxy. Thus, this object is unrelated to LIGO/Virgo S191213g
(GCN #26402).

We thank the observer S. Xu and the Gemini staff for their rapid response
and  facilitating this Target of Opportunity observation.
