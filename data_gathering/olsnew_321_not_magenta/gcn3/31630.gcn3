The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:21:17 UT on 22 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220222A (trigger 667189282.835626 / 220222098).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 27.1, Dec = -8.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 48m, -8d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59.0 degrees.
