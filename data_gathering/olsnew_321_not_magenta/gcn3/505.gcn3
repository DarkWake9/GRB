K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the NEAR GRB team, and C. Kouveliotou, on behalf of the BATSE
GRB team, report:

We have obtained a ~24 sq. arcmin. (3 sigma) Ulysses-BATSE-NEAR 
error box for GRB991216 ((BATSE 7906: GCN 463, GCN 502).  The 
corners of the box are:
 
 RA(2000)          Decl.(2000)
 5 h 9 m 34 s      11 o 16 ' 41 "
 5 h 9 m 03 s      11 o 03 ' 54 "
 5 h 9 m 52 s      11 o 27 ' 06 "
 5 h 9 m 21 s      11 o 14 ' 40 "

This box includes the optical transient (GCN 472), and further
refinements to it are possible.  Maps of this box and the earlier
SAX-Ulysses annulus (GCN 472) may be found at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/991216.
