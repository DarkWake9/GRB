TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6068
SUBJECT: GRB070126: Swift-XRT Observation
DATE:    07/02/02 00:06:37 GMT
FROM:    Loredana Vetere at PSU  <vetere@astro.psu.edu>

L. Vetere, J. Racusin, D.N. Burrows, C. Pagani (PSU) report on behalf
of Swift XRT Team:

We have re-observed the field of GRB 070126 (Vetere et al., GCN 6027)
from 2007-01-30  00:49:07.62 (~340ks after BAT trigger) to 2007-02-01
14:10:17.0 for a total exposure of ~27.2ks.

The possible afterglow candidate that we reported in GCN 6045 is still
present and shows a slightly increased count rate (1.4 +/- 0.3)E-03 cts/sec
compared to (0.76 +/- 0.23) E-03 cts/sec obtained with the first 28ks of
observation. We thus conclude that the object reported is not the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 070126.

No other point sources are detected above the 3 sigma upper limit of
1.0e-3 cts/s inside BAT error circle.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
