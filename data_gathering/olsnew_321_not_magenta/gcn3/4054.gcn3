TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4054
SUBJECT: GRB 051001: I-band limit
DATE:    05/10/02 01:41:05 GMT
FROM:    Derek Fox at PSU  <dfox@astro.psu.edu>

D.B. Fox (Penn State), N.E.D. Noel (Instituto de Astrofisica de
Canarias), and S.L. Prior (RSAA/ANU), with B.A. Peterson and
B.P. Schmidt (RSAA/ANU) report:

"We have observed the Swift XRT localization region for GRB 051001
(Swift Trigger 157870; Moretti et al., GCN 4051) with the 40-inch
telescope at Siding Spring Observatory.  A coadded I-band image with
mean epoch 1 October 11:53 UT (52 minutes after the burst) reveals no
sources within this region, to a limiting magnitude of I>20.8 mag as
calibrated against the photometry of the USNO-B1.0 catalog.

In particular, we do not detect the extended object of Rol, Levan &
Tanvir (GCN 4053) to the quoted limit."
