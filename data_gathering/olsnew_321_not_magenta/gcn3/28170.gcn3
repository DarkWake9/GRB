We observed the field of GRB 200729A (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 28165) with the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope equipped with 
NICS in imaging mode. A series of images were obtained with the J filter on 2020-06-29 from 22:28:28 UT to 22:55:43 UT 
(i.e. between about 2.8 and 3.3 hours after the burst). 

No obvious source is found within the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 28168) down to a 3-sigma limiting 
magnitude of J > 19.6 (Vega, calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).
