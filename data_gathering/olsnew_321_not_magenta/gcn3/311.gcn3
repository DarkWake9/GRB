Luigi Piro (BeppoSAX Mission Scientist on behalf of the BeppoSAX team) report:

BeppoSAX MAIL n. 99/8: GRB990510: possible X-ray afterglow

A BeppoSAX follow-up of GRB990510 started about 8 hr after the burst.
Preliminary analysis of the first two orbits of the MECS data at SOC shows
a previously unknown strong source in the center of the WFC error circle.

Preliminary coordinates  are:
R.A.(2000)= 204.605
DEC(2000)= -80.490

The error radius is 1.5'

Considering its strength, this X-ray source is likely the X-ray
afterglow of GB990510. BeppoSAX is continuing its observation.
