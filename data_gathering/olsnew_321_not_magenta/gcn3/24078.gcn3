Lipunov et al (GCN 24076) reported the discovery of an optical transient 
MASTER OT J140518.22-395309.9  close to the southern part of the 
skymap of LIGO/Virgo source S190408an. 

The ATLAS survey (Tonry et al. 2018, Stalder et al. 2016) has detected
this source since MJD=58555 (2019-03-13) at  o = 17.4. It peaked around 
MJD=58569 at o = 17 and has a SN like lightcurve. There is no obvious
catalogued host galaxy. 

In summary, we confirm the discovery of MASTER that this is a real 
optical transient (with no host galaxy) at coordinates : 

14:05:18.21 -39:53:10.0

211.32588 -39.88612

But that it is almost certainly a foreground SN about 1 month old, 
and very unlikely to be related to LIGO/Virgo S190408an.
