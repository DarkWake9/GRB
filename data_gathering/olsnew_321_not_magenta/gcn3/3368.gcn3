Edo Berger (Carnegie Observatories), S. Bradley Cenko, Chuck Steidel,
Naveen Reddy, and Derek B. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We obtained a 900-sec spectrum of the optical candidate (GCN 3366) of GRB
050505 (GCN 3360) with LRIS on the Keck I 10-m telescope on 2005, May 6.27
UT.  We find very strong absorption over the range of 6200-6500 A,
corresponding to Ly alpha absorption around z = 4.1 to 4.3.  In addition,
we find several metal absorption lines, including SiIV (1393,1402), at a
redshift of 4.27.

At this redshift, the second highest measured for any GRB, the isotropic
equivalent gamma-ray energy is 7.7e53 erg."
