Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 20:27:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201021C (trigger=1001130).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 12.550, -55.839 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 50m 12s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 50' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 20:29:00.6 UT, 102.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 12.53057, -55.86729 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 50m 07.34s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 52' 02.2"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 109 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.05
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 105 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the list of sources generated on-board at
  RA(J2000)  =	00:50:06.85 =  12.52855
  DEC(J2000) = -55:51:56.7  = -55.86576
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 1.10 arc sec. This position is 2.8
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
17.19. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.02.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
