Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130102A (trigger #544784)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 14127).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 311.435, 49.838 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 45m 44.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +49d 50' 16.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 99%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a peak starting at ~T+10 sec, peaking 
at ~T+22 sec, and ending around T+180 sec.  There is a possibility
of emission out to at least T+230 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 77.5 +- 18.2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+12.51 to T+100.43 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.39 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.2 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+23.54 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
