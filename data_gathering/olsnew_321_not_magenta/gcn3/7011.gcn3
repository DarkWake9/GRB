P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory) and G. G. Williams (MMTO), on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The 1.54m Kuiper telescope began observations of the error region of
GRB 071025 (Swift trigger 295301, Pagani et al. GCN 6986) at 04:37:08
UT, approximately 28 minutes after the trigger.  Observations were
obtained in the V, R, and I-bands. The afterglow first reported by
Rykoff et al. (GCN 6987) is clearly visible in the individual early R
and I band images but not in the V-band images or in the sum of the
V-band images.  Observations continued until 09:47:09 UT.

The aperture photometry results below were obtained from sums of
individual images using nearby stars in the USNO-B1.0 and NOMAD
catalogs. Further analysis of additional epochs is continuing.
