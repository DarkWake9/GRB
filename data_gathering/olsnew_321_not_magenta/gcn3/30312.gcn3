Toronto), B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Swift-BAT-detected burst GRB 210618A (Bernardini et al. GCN Circ.
30250). The observations now extend from T0+3.7 ks to T0+424.9 ks. 

Of the sources reported by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 30252), "Source 2"
is believed to be the afterglow.  The position of this source is RA,
Dec=235.7698, +46.0691 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 15:43:04.75
Dec(J2000): +46:04:08.6

with an uncertainty of 9.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 2.6 arcmin from the Swift-BAT position.  The results of the
XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01056426.
The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
