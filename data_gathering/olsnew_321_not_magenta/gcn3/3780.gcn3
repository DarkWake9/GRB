J. Haislip, D. Reichart report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically observed the localization
of GRB 050803 (Band et al., GCN 3748) beginning 7.1 hours after the burst
in repeating blocks of BVRcIc (two simultaneously).

We do not detect any new sources within or around the XRT localization.
In a 54 x 40 sec integration of mean epoch 10.0 hours after the burst, we
measure a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of Rc = 21.4, based on 3 USNO-B1.0
stars.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
