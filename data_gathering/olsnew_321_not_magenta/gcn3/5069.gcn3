TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5069
SUBJECT: GRB 060502B: Swift/UVOT upper limits
DATE:    06/05/03 10:37:39 GMT
FROM:    Tracey Poole at MSSL  <tsp@mssl.ucl.ac.uk>

T. S. Poole (UCL-MSSL), and E. Troja (INAF-IASFPA) on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team.

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB060502b (BAT 
Trigger=208275, E. Troja, et. al, GCN 5055) at 17:25:38 UT, 57s after 
the BAT trigger (which includes the 10s V filter settling  exposure). No 
new source is detected at the XRT position (E. Troja, GCN 5063) in 
coadded images with any of the filters. The following 5-sigma magnitude 
upper limits are not corrected for Galactic extinction; E(B-V) = 0.044.

Filter   T_range(s)  T_exp(s)  5sigma(mag)

V         57-35329   3002      20.29
B        658-24560   1204      20.62
U	 634-41112   3819      21.04	
UVW1     610-40198   4038      21.29	
UVM2     586-36126   3633      21.31	
UVW2     686-34417   2259      21.29	
WHITE	  74-6845    619       20.49	

Where T_range is time post-trigger, and T_exp is the exposure time of
the observation. A 6 arcsec radius was used for all filters.
