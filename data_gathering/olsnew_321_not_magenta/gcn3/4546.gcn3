Brian Schmidt (ANU), Mark Wieringa (ATNF),

report on behalf of a larger collaboration

"We observed the field of GRB 061117 (GCN 4519) with the Australia 
Telescope Compact Array at 4.8 and 8.6GHz beginning January 18.4 UT. We 
detect no sources in a 20" box around the XRT/OT position (GCN 
4522,4536) to an approximate 4 sigma limit of 0.6 mJy at both frequencies. "
 
We would like to thank the Director and Staff of the Australia Telescope 
National Facility for obtaining these observations as part of a Target 
of Opportunity Program.
