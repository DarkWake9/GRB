We observed the entire error box of the GRB 021201 burst
(GCN 1719) with the NOAO WIYN telescope on 2002 Dec. 5.5 (UT).
The 3x600s R-band images were taken in 1.2" seeing. We confirm
the presence of a bright optical source near the Chandra x-ray
source #10 (GCN 1741) identified by Castro Cerón et al. (GCN 1743).
The optical source is USNO-A2.0 1050.05586294 listed
in the catalog at 08:07:49.350 +21:12:33.66 (J2000) and
R=18.9. We estimate the brightness at R=20.4 using a zero
point from a nearby Landolt standard star field. To search
for fainter objects, we subtracted a PSF scaled to the
peak of the USNO star and found no other sources brighter
than R=23.3 within 4" of the Chandra #10 x-ray position.
