S. R. Oates & M. De Pasquale (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT Team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter of GRB 130627A (trigger= 559132)
starting 2979 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25%
of the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6
mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of
the BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete down to about 18
mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.09.
