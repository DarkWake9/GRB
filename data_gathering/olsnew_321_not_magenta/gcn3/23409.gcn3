report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2018-10-28T14:09:43.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181028A (trigger ID: HEB181028590) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/LAT (Axelsson et al.,GCN 23386);
Fermi/GBM (Bissaldi et al.,GCN 23387); 
IPN Triangulation (Hurley et al.,GCN 23388); 
Konus-Wind observation (Kozlova et al., GCN 23393);
CALET/GBM (A. Yoshida et al., GCN 23399). 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 23.58 s measured from T0-4.53 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+14.63 s, is 1351.0 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 11055.5 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
GRB mode with the energy range of about 200-3000 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
