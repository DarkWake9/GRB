The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:52:35 UT on 17 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220417A (trigger 671896360.964484 / 220417578).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 107.7, Dec = 11.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 10m, 11d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 99.0 degrees.
