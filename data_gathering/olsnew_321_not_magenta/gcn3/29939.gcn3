Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210504A (trigger #1046782)
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 29929).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 222.379, -30.557 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 49m 31.0s
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 33' 23.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses
that start at ~T-30 s and end at ~T+150 s. There might be additional
burst emission before the GRB came into the BAT FOV at ~T-43 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 135.06 +- 9.57 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-27.55 to T+134.76 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.64 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.7 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+87.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
