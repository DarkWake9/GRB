K. Alatalo, D. Perley and J. S. Bloom (UCB) report:

Starting at 2006-02-06 07:41:37 UT (2.91 hrs after the trigger) we began 
observing the field of GRB060206 (GCN 4682) with PAIRITEL. The transient 
reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN 4683, GCN 4689) is well detected in each 
of the 1800s mosaics simultaneously in JHKs bands, and is seen to fade 
between mosaics. The preliminary magnitude of the transient in the first 
epoch of imaging in each band, calibrated to the 2MASS catalog, is:

J: 15.96 +- 0.03
H: 15.25 +- 0.03
Ks: 14.54 +- 0.04
