D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), Y.-H. Han (NAOC/CAS, HUST), Y.-D. Hu (IAA-CSIC), Y.
Qing (Geneva Observatory), L.-P. Xin (NAOC/CAS) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160131A (Page & Barthelmy, GCN 18951) using 
the LCOGT-1m located at the Siding Spring Observatory. Observations 
started at 11:50:49 UT and ended at 12:15:46 UT on 2016-01-31 (i.e., 
3.505 - 3.921 hr after the BAT trigger) and a series of 150s 
U-/B-/V-/R-/I-band frames were obtained.

The afterglow of the burst (e.g., Page & Barthelmy, GCN 18951; Yurkov et 
al., GCN 18952; Guidorzi et al., GCN 18953; Xin et al., GCN 1894,18955; 
Watson et al., GCN 18956) is detected in our individual image in each 
band. Preliminary analysis gives rise to the following magnitudes:

m(I) = 16.05 +/- 0.02
m(R) = 16.56 +/- 0.02
m(V) = 17.07 +/- 0.02
m(B) = 17.59 +/- 0.02

calibrated with four SDSS stars in the field.
