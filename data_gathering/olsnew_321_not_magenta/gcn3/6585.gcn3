Swift UVOT Observations of GRB 070628

C. Gronwall (PSU) and S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA)
report on the behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

In response to GRB 070628 (Swift/BAT trigger 283320) at 14:41:02.84 UT,
UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White 
(160-650 nm) filter starting 1099 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is 
a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
    RA(J2000)  = 07:41:06.12 = 115.2755
    DEC(J2000) = -20:16:46.2  = -20.2795
with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.6 arc sec. This position is 34.9 
arcsec. from the center of the BAT error circle. The estimated magnitude is 
19.1 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made 
for extinction.
