We again observed the field of GRB 140129A (Melandri, et al., GCN 15760)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/01 31.11 to 2014/01 31.20 UTC
(47.35 to 49.51 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.38
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.58 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

The afterglow observed previously by RATIR (Cucchiara, et al., GCN 15762;
Butler, et al., GCN 15779) is no longer detected.  In comparison with the
SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 22.99
  i     > 22.59
  Z     > 21.59
  Y     > 21.14
  J     > 20.82
  H     > 20.49

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic

extinction in the direction of the GRB.
