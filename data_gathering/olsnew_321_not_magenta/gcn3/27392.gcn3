The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:40:30 UT on 17 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200317A (trigger 606098435.488212 / 200317028).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 65.5, Dec = -46.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 21m, -46d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 50.0 degrees.
