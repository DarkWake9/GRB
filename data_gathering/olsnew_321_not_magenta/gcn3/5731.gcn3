Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 061019 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 234516) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 43.5s after the GRB trigger
(5.3s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
from 1 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good. Unfortunately, the local horizon does not
allow to obtain sky images before 902s after the trigger
(when the source was higher than 4 deg. elevation).

No OT was detected at the position of XRT (Guidorzi & Romano,
GCNC 5729) nor at the position of REM (Covino et al. GCNC 5730).

The date of trigger : t0 = 2006-10-19T04:19:06.816

The first image is 90.0s exposure:
t0+902s to t0+992s : R > 14.8

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+904s to t0+1382s : R > 15.8

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=181.7352 lat= +4.2508
and the galactic extinction in R band is 3.1 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.

N.B. Sky was cloudy at the TAROT Calern observatory.
