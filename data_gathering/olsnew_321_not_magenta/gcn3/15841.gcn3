We observed the field of GRB 140215A (Markwardt, et al., GCN 15837) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir beginning 110 seconds after the Swift BAT
trigger.  Initial data were taken out-of-focus, and will require special
handling.  In-focus data were acquired from 2014/02 15.20 to 2014/02
15.22UTC (0.65 to 1.13 hours after the BAT trigger), corresponding to
a total of
0.36 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.15 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift UVOT error circle, in comparison with 2MASS,
we obtain the following detections:

  r     17.45 +/- 0.01
  i     17.08 +/- 0.01
  Z     16.82 +/- 0.01
  Y     16.55 +/- 0.02
  J     16.34 +/- 0.01
  H     16.05 +/- 0.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.  Further observations are ongoing.
