We observed the field of GRB 150728A (Krimm et al., GCN 18087) with the 
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on 
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/07 29.19 to 2015/07 29.48 UTC (15.73 to 
22.75 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.29 hours 
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

The brightest source within the enhanced Swift/XRT error circle (Beardmore 
et al., GCN 18088) is the cataloged source 2MASS 19285425+3354576, for 
which we determine a position of 19:28:54.26 +33:54:57.6 (J2000, ±0.5") 
and magnitudes:

   r	16.71 ± 0.02
   i	16.49 ± 0.01
   z	16.14 ± 0.04

We detect two other uncataloged sources on the edge of the error circle. 
For source A we determine a position of 19:28:54.80 +33:54:58.2 (J2000, 
±0.5") and magnitudes:

   r     21.37 ± 0.04
   i     20.89 ± 0.04
   z     19.54 ± 0.13

and for source B we determine 19:28:54.25 +33:55:2.6 (J2000, ±0.5") and:

   r     21.11 ± 0.04
   i     20.73 ± 0.03
   z     20.21 ± 0.21

These magnitudes are in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, 
are in the AB system, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the 
direction of the GRB.

Our source A appears to correspond to the source reported by Dichiara et 
al. (GCN 18090). If this association is correct, then there is little 
evidence for fading between about 1 hour and 16-23 hours.

Mártir.
