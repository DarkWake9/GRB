report on behalf of the MAXI team:

We examined the MAXI/GSC all-sky X-ray images (2-20 keV) obtained
in the orbit and the day after the LVC trigger
G274296 at 2017-02-17 06:05:55.050 UTC (GCN 20689) and
G275404 at 2017-02-25 18:30:21.374 UTC (GCN 20738).

MAXI/GSC did not observe (HV off) at the trigger time of G274296,
and observed from T0+843 sec.
MAXI/GSC scanned more than 87%
of the whole sky in the 92-min orbit, which includes 77.4% of the
90% regions in the skyprobcc_cWB skymap.
One day image covers 89.7% of the 90% regions
in the skyprobcc_cWB skymap.
No significant new source was found in these images.
The upper limits for the X-ray flux are different depending
on the part of the sky.
For instance, typical 2-20 keV 1-sigma (3-sigma) upper limits obtained
from the one-orbit and one-day images are
40 (120) mCrab and 15 (35) mCrab, respectively,
which was larger than the typical upper limits of GSC
because anti-coincidence function of one of the GSC cameras was disabled.

In G275404 observation,
MAXI/GSC did not observe at the trigger time
and observed from T0+1246 sec.
MAXI/GSC scanned more than 62%
of the whole sky in the one orbit, which includes 55.0% of the
90% regions in the bayestar skymap.
One day image covers 96.3% of the 90% regions
in the bayestar skymap.
No significant new source was found in these images.
For instance, typical 2-20 keV 1-sigma (3-sigma) upper limits obtained
from the one-orbit and one-day images are
12 (36) mCrab and 3 (9) mCrab, respectively.

MAXI/GSC also observed the position of the possible gamma-ray
transient (GCN 20754),
but it was difficult to estimate upper limits because the effect of stray photon
from bright GRS 1915+105 near by the localized position of the transient
was large.
