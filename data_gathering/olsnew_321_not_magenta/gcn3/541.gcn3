D. A. Frail (NRAO) and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a large
collaboration: 

"Starting on February 10.15 UT we used the VLA to observe a field
centered at the position of the optical transient identified by Boer,
Atteia and Klotz (GCN 535). There are no radio sources above a 3-sigma
threshold of 0.18 mJy within a 10-arcsecond radius of the OT."
