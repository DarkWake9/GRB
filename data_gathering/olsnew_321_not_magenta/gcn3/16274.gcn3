W. Fong (Harvard), R. Chornock (Harvard), D. Fox (PSU), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report:

"We observed the location of the long-duration GRB 140515A (D'Avanzo et
al., GCN 16267) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) mounted on
the Gemini-North 8-meter telescope at a mid-time of 2014 May 15.458 UT
(1.78 hr after the BAT trigger). We obtained 480 sec in each of the i- and
z-bands in 0.45" seeing. We detect the optical afterglow (Chornock et al.,
GCN 16269), within the enhanced XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 16270),
located at

RA(J2000) = 12:24:15.51
Dec(J2000) = +15:06:16.6

with a positional uncertainty of 0.1" in each coordinate. The optical
afterglow has a brightness of z = 20.27 +/- 0.11 AB mag, and is at least 3
mag fainter in our i-band observations. Both the astrometry and photometry
are calibrated to SDSS.

We thank the Gemini staff for their assistance with these observations."
