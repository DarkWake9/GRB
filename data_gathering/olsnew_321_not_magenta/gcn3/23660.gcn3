L. Izzo, D. A. Kann (HETH-IAA/CSIC) A. de Ugarte Postigo (DARK/NBI & HETH-IAA/CSIC), M. Blazek, C. C. Thoene (HETH-IAA/CSIC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 190106A (Sonbas et al. GCN 23615) with the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain. Observations started on January 6th at 21:10:35 UT (8.0 hours after the GRB trigger) and we obtained a series of 5x60s images in the g, r and i filters.

We clearly detect the optical afterglow (Lipunov  et al. GCN 23616, Itoh et al. GCN 23617, Mao et al. GCN 23618, Reva et al., GCN 23620, Xin et al. GCN 23622, Quadri et al. GCN 23624, Hu et al. GCN 23627, Noschese et al. GCN 23628) for which we measure the following magnitudes:

g = 19.47 +- 0.03
r = 18.90 +- 0.09
i = 18.49 +- 0.26

The calibration was performed using nearby SDSS stars.
