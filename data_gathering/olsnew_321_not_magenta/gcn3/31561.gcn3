The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:00:50 UT on 9 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220209A (trigger 666140455.423452 / 220209959).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 352.3, Dec = 72.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 29m, 72d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
