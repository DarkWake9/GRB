SUBJECT: RBO RI observations of GRB 050713A

FROM:    Ron Canterna at U of Wyoming  <canterna@uwyo.edu>

C. Rodgers, E. Hausel, and R. Canterna report on behalf of the Red Buttes Observatory GRB Team as part of the FUN GRB Collaboration. We responded to GRB 050713A (Swift trigger 145675; 4:29 UT) at 04:54 UT with a series of 5 minute R and I exposures centered on the location of the original Swift-BAT GRB position under excellent conditions.  We did not observe the afterglow candidate (Malesani GCN 3582) brighter than the following magnitude limits:

UT      Time Since   Filter     Limiting 
Start   GRB                      Magnitude 
04:56   0:27          R           19.4 
05:01   0:31          I           18.2 
06:02   1:33          R           19.4 
06:08   1:38          I           18.7 

10 sigma limiting magnitudes were derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue
