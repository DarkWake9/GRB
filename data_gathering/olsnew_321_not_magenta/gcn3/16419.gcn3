report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:24:40.52 UT on 19 June 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140619B (trigger 424869883  / 140619475)

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 133.4, DEC = -3.7 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 08h 54m, -3d 42'), with an uncertainty
of 5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak with substructure,
with a duration (T90) of about 0.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.192 s to T0+0.640 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.11 +/- 0.16 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1450 +/- 220 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.70 +/- 0.09)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 64-msec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.38 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 7.6 +/- 3.4 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 1356 +/- 252 keV, alpha = -0.06 +/- 0.19
and beta = 3.3 +/- 1.4.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
