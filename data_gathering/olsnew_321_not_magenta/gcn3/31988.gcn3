report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:51:50.74 UT on 01 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220501A (trigger 673127515 / 220501828), which
was also detected by Swift/BAT (A. D'Ai et al. 2022, GCN 31982). The
Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 31983) is consistent with the
Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 94 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a FRED-like burst
with a duration (T90) of about 51 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.6 s to T0+47.6 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.49 +/- 0.18 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 114 +/- 11 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.53 +/- 0.24)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
