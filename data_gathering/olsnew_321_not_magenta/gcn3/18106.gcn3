S. B. Cenko, L. P. Singer (NASA/GSFC), M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie), and V. Bhalerao (IUCAA) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We conducted follow-up observations of Fermi trigger 458852670 (t0 = 2015-07-17 19:04:26.72) with the Palomar 48-inch Oschin telescope (P48).  Observations began at 4:15 UT on 2015-07-18, ~ 9.2 hours after the GBM trigger time.

We imaged 20 fields covering an area of 145 deg^2 in and around the 1-sigma statistical+systematic uncertainty region of the final Fermi GBM localization.  We estimate an 11% a priori probability that these fields contain the true location of the source.  Sifting through candidate variable sources using image subtraction and standard iPTF vetting procedures, we detected the following optical transient candidates:

iPTF15bts, at the coordinates:
  RA(J2000) = 15h 23m 52.94s (230.970585 deg)
  Dec(J2000) = +31d 48' 39.3" (+31.810910 deg)

A low resolution spectrum obtained with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope at 6:27 UT on 2015-07-23 suggest that the source is a Type II SN (based on a blue continuum and broad Balmer absorption features) at a redshift of z = 0.094 (from SN features).

A low resolution spectrum obtained with DBSP on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope at 5:10 UT on 2015-07-23 suggest that the source is a Type II SN (based broad Balmer and Ca absorption features) at a redshift of z = 0.047 (from SN features).

Times are relative to the GBM trigger. Magnitudes are in the Mould R filter and in the AB system, calibrated with respect to point sources in SDSS as described in Ofek et al. (2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664065).

We do not consider any of these sources to be likely candidates for the optical afterglow of Fermi trigger 458852670.

The diagram http://www.its.caltech.edu/~lsinger/iptf/Fermi458852670.pdf shows the locations of our candidates and the P48 fields in relation to the Fermi GBM 1- and 2-sigma statistical+systematic contours.
