The long GRB 060614 (Swift-BAT trigger #214805;
Parsons et al., GCN 5252; Barthelmy et al., GCN 5256)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=45831.590 s UT (12:43:51.590).

The Konus-Wind light shows an intense multipeaked
initial pulse with a duration of ~6 sec,
followed by a weaker softer highly variable emission
seen up to T-T0 ~110 sec.


The spectrum of the initial intense pulse
(accumulated from T-T0=0 to T-T0=8.448 sec)
can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 1.57(-0.14, +0.12)
and Ep = 302(-85, +214) keV (chi2 = 73/59 dof).
The fluence of this part is 8.19(-2.52, +0.56)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range).

The spectrum of the remaining part of the burst
(accumulated from T-T0=8.448 to T-T0=106.752 sec)
can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a simple power law with photon index
2.13 +/- 0.05 (chi2 = 63/49 dof).
The fluence of this part is 3.27(-0.23,+0.17)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range).
We note that because the derived photon index is ~2,
this fluence value is very sensitive to the upper boundary
of the energy range.

The burst total fluence is 4.09(-0.34, +0.18)x10^-5 erg/cm2
and peak flux on 64-ms time scale measured from T-T0=0.032 sec
4.50(-1.53, +0.72)x10^-6 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
