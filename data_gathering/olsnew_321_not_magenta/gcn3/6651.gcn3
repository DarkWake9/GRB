D. Malesani (DARK), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire), J.P.U. Fynbo, J. 
Hjorth and P.M. Vreeswijk (DARK) report:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 070721B (Ziaeepour et al., 
GCN 6640; Schady, GCN 6641) with the ESO-VLT equipped with FORS2.

Close to the UVOT position (Schady, GCN 6641), we detect two objects:

1: RA = 02:12:32.97, Dec = -02:11:41.0
2: RA = 02:12:33.03, Dec = -02:11:41.6

We note that object #1 is consistent with the UVOT position, while #2 is 
1.6" away. We estimate R~23.8 and R~24.3 on Jul 22.319 UT (21.6 hr after 
the GRB) for objects #1 and #2, respectively.

We acquired spectra for both objects. Thanks to the detection of a DLA 
and several metallic lines, we infer for object #2 a redshift z=3.626. 
The spectrum is typical of a GRB afterglow, and we thus suggest that 
object #2 is the optical counterpart of GRB 070721B. This redshift is 
also consistent with the nondetection of the object in filters bluer 
than V (De Pasquale & Ziaeepour, GCN 6650). Further observations are 
planned to test the variability of both objects.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff, in particular 
Angela Cortes, Dominique Naef and Yuri Beletsky. We thank Massimiliano 
De Pasquale for useful discussion.
