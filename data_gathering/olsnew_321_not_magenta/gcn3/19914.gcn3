MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in SAAO was pointed to the FERMI GBM  GRB160910.72 15 sec after 
notice time and 65 sec after trigger time at 2016-09-10 17:20:45 UT.

On our first (20s exposure started 75 sec after GBM trigger)  set we do 
not found  optical transient within  FERMI error-box (ra=14 54 00 
dec=+39 23 00 r=3.41, trigger 495220783 / 160910722
(Veres  and  C.Meegan, GCN 19901)) because very low 
altitude on horizont ~3 degrees (one tube was under the roof).

Fortunatelly, we saw OT by one of two MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras (5 
sec expositon, 0.25 sec readout) .
On MASTER-SAAO VWF Camera  we see OT at 3 sigma confidence level with 
magnitude 11.6 +- 0.5 mag on a co-added images with total exposure 95 
seconds  (19 x 5 sec) starting at 17:20:45 i.e. 65 sec after trigger time. Mean 
time is 113 sec after trigger.

On our second MASTER-SAAO (30s 
exposure)  set started at 2016-09-10 17:22:26 (167 sec after trigger time) 
we  found OT  within FERMI error-box  with unfileterd
magnitide m = 11.6+-0.1 . The second exposition was making after receiving 
new Fermi GBM coordinates.

Ra, Dec  =  14h 45m 46.03s   +39d 04m 00.52s
err = +-0.5 arcsec

MASTER-IAC  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in IAC was starting survey on the FERMI GBM  GRB160910.72 
error-box  (ra=14 46 14 dec=+39 25 10 r=1.0)  11142 sec after notice time 
and 11239 sec after trigger time at 2016-09-10 20:26:58 UT. The 5-sigma upper 
limit on our first (60s exposure)  set is about 18.3 mag .  The OT 
unfiltered magnitude is 17.4+-0.4 .


The light curve is available at
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/GRB160910A.png


The MASTER-SAAO power law index  alpha  = 1.30+-0.07 ( I ~ t^-alpha) in 
agreement with MASTER-IAC and some 
contradiction with late point (Malesani  et al., GCN 19908 )

The MASTER-SAAO and NOT combined   power law index  alpha  = 
1.17+-0.02 .


All MASTER observations was done  before LAT alert.
