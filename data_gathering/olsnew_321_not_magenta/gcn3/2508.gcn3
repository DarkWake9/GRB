NUMBER:  2508
SUBJECT: XMM-Newton observation of GRB040106

M. Ehle, R. Gonzalez-Riestra and B. Gonzalez-Garcia, from the
XMM-Newton SOC report:

Quick-Look-Analysis of the first 30 ksec of the XMM-Newton
observation of the GRB040106 field (Mereghetti et al.,
GCN 2505) shows the presence of a bright source in the
EPIC-pn and MOS cameras within the INTEGRAL error circle,
XMMU J115213.1-464713:

R.A. (J2000) = 11h 52m 13.1s
Dec. (J2000) = -46deg 47' 13"

The EPIC-pn count rate decreased from 0.7 to 0.2 counts/sec
during the first 30 ksec of the observation.

At this stage of reduction the position error is expected
to be less than 10 arcsec.
