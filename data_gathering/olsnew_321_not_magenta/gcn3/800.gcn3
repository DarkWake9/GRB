A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope for
an 11x11 arcmin field that is centered on the optical
transient discovered by Berger, et al. (GCN 795).
The photometric data is based on three photometric
nights, but with poor seeing.  Stars brighter than
V=14.5 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have performed an initial deletion of galaxies from
the dataset, but do not guarantee that all objects
in this file are stellar.

We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000911.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors are less than 100mas.
