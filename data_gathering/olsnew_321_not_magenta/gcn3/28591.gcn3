The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:06:00.94 UT on 8 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201008B (trigger 623873165 / 201008754).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 90.8, Dec = 39.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 6h 3m, +39d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.1 degrees.
