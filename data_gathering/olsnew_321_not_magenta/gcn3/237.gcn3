The name of C. A. Young, duty scientist at the time of CGRO-COMPTEL's
initial rapid (~10 minute) localization of GRB 990123, was inadvertently
left off the author list.

The correct attribution should be as follows:

"A. Connors, R. M. Kippen and C. A. Young, for the CGRO-COMPTEL Rapid
Burst Response collaboration; and S. Barthelmy and P. Butterworth, for
BACODINE/GCN, report the following:"
