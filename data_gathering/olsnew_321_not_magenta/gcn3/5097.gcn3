N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) and J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) report
on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We have observed the Swift BAT location of GRB 060510 (Krim et al., GCN 
5096) with the MDM 1.3m telescope on May 10 08:50 UT, 26  minutes after 
the trigger.  We detect a faint source located at RA:15 56 29.615, Dec: 
79 34 13.02 (+/- 2'') in a 600-s I band exposure, which is a potential 
optical afterglow for this event. The object appears to be fainter 
than R~22.5 in a previous 600~s exposure. This supports the idea that 
GRB 060510B could be a high-redshift or highly-reddened burst. Further 
observations are encouraged. Results here are very preliminary and 
analysis is in progress.

This message may be cited."
