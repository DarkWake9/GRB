S. B. Cenko (Caltech), P. A. Price (IfA/Hawaii), E. Berger (Carnegie), and
D. B. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB070219 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 6104)) with
the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Gemini North
Telescope.  Images consisted of 4 x 180 s exposures in z' and 2 x 180 s
exposures in i' at a mean epoch of approximately 14:50 19 February UT (~
13.7 hr after the burst).  Inside the revised XRT error circle (Starling
et al., GCN 6112), we see no sources to limiting magnitudues of i' >
23.0, z' > 22.0.  Photometric calibration was performed relative to the
SDSS fields provided by Cool et al. (GCN 6105)
