Guy Pooley, on behalf of the AMI collaboration (Cavendish Astrophysics,
University of Cambridge) reports:

Further observations of the field of GRB090313 have been made with the
AMI Large Array in the frequency range 14.5 to 17.5 GHz.

Including those already reported in GCN 9003 and 9007, after minor
recalibration, the flux densities measured were

2009 Mar 16.13  800 +- 80 microJy
2009 Mar 17.06  882 +- 77
2009 Mar 18.05  815 +- 129
2009 Mar 20.16  718 +- 97
2009 Mar 23.05  655 +- 69

Observations lasted between 1 and 3 h, and the resolution is
approximately 60x25 arcsec. The position is consistent with that
of the optical transient (Chornock et al GCN8979).
