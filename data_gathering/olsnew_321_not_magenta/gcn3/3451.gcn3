SUBJECT: XRF050522, BVRcIc field photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB Team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for an 11x11arcmin
field centered on the coordinates for the INTEGRAL burst
XRF050522 (Gotz, et al. GCN 3446)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric night
but with bright moonlight.  Stars brighter than V=12.0
are saturated and should be used with care.  We have placed
the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/xrf050522.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
The estimated external photometric error is about 0.02mag.

The first image was taken 16 minutes after the burst,
and show no new sources in the INTEGRAL error box down
to a plate limit of Rc=18.5.

Since no afterglow has been reported, we do not anticipate
any further observations at this time.  However,
as always, you should check the dates on the .dat file prior to
final publication to get the latest photometry.  There is
a README file on the ftp directory to give you information
about the procedures used to calibrate these fields.
