After GRB030601 alert (HETE 2728) MASTER robotic telescope
(http://observ.pereplet.ru) had automatically pointed to the corresponding
area of the sky (105 seconds after trigger time). There were clouds near
the horizont and they were imaged on the CCD frame. First measurable image
of the error box area was taken 55 minutes after the burst. No optical
counterpart was visible up to 12th magnitude in R band. We had been
observing about 90% of the error box area for almost 3 hours. On the last
image taken on 21:26UT (3h13m after the burst) no optical counterpart is
visible up to 15th magnitude in R band. We had to stop our observations
because of rain with possible thunderstorm.

Observations were made under bad weather conditions (clouds + low altitude
above the horizont, 25 degrees at culmination + bright sky because of high
Moscow's latitude).

These are preliminary results.
