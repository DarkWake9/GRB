Using the data set from T-119 to T+54 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 171011A (trigger #778154)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 21993).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 236.766, -10.064 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 47m 03.7s
  Dec(J2000) = -10d 03' 50.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 63%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked light curve that
starts and peaks at ~ T0, and ends at ~ T+3 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is
2.27 +- 0.24 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.06 to T+2.74 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.68 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.0 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
