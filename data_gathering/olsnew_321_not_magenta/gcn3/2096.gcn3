B. C. Lee, D. Q. Lamb, D. L. Tucker and S. Kent on behalf of the SDSS
GRB team, report:

The optical transient associated with GRB 030329 (Peterson and Price,
GCN 1985; K. Torii, GCN 1986) was observed with the SDSS 0.5m
"Photometric Telescope" (PT) at two epochs, starting March 31.181 UT
and April 01.153 UT.  The preliminary r-band magnitude at March 31.181
UT was observed to be 16.60 +/- 0.02, and the u g r i z data on that
date is well fit by a flux power law of approximately nu^-0.94, or
nu^-0.85 if a reddening of E(B-V)=0.025 is applied (Bloom, GCN 2011 and
Schlegel et al. 1998).  The April 01 UT images are still being
processed.
