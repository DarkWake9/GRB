F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3302 seconds after the BAT trigger (LaPorte et al.GCN Circ. 23993). 
There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
RA(J2000) =	03:18:27.72 = 49.61551
DEC(J2000) = -47:12:52.9 = -47.21469
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.75 arc sec. 
The estimated magnitude is 17.10 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.14. 
With a single observation, we have no indication
whether the source is variable.
No correction has been
made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.
