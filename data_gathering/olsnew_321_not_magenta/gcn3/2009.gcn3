TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2009
SUBJECT: GRB 030329: Upper limit from 5.6 hours before trigger
DATE:    03/03/30 00:17:01 GMT
FROM:    James Wren at LANL  <jwren@nis.lanl.gov>

J. Wren and W. T. Vestrand report on behalf of the RAPTOR team:

While the location of HETE-2 trigger 2652 was below our horizon at
the time of the GCN notice, we did obtain observations earlier in
the evening of the GRB field with one of our wide-field RAPTOR sky
monitors.  The observation nearest to the time of the burst was taken
at 05:58:39.56 UT, 5.64 hours before the event.  This image does not
show the optical counterpart to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of
Rc=12.8.  Unfortunately, the weather degraded rapidly later in the
night, preventing further observations of this field.
