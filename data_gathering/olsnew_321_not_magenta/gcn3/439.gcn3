report:

"We have obtained six 10-minute exposures at the revised
BeppoSAX WFC position for GRB 991105 (Piro et al. GCN 433)
with the 0.61-m Mount John University Observatory (MJUO)
telescope. The first set of images were taken on Nov 6.41 UT
(17.1 hr after the GRB) through a broad band filter (R + I
bandpass). The second one was obtained on Nov 7.37 UT with
identical setup. After a visual comparison with the Digital
Sky Survey and among the two co-added images, no sources
varying by more than 0.3 mag were seen to the DSS limit (R
about 21) within the BeppoSAX error box."
