C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC), S. D. Barthelmy (NASA/GSFC), N. Gehrels 
(NASA/GSFC), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) on behalf of GCN announce:

A lapse in appropriations of the US Federal government may significantly 
impact the operation of the GCN.

We are uncertain regarding the scope of the impact, but network access 
to NASA GSFC systems where GCN is hosted may be cut off from the general 
public.  This may lead to the possibility of being unable to accept or 
distribute Notices and Circulars.  The GCN web site (gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov) 
may also be unavailable.  The impacts could start as early as 00:01 UT 
October 1.
