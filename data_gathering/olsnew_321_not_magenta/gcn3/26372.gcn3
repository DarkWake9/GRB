report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the reported LIGO/Virgo 
S191204r event (GCN #26334), trigger time 2019-12-04T17:15:26.092 UTC. 
At T0, about 4% of the LIGO localization region was covered by the 
Insight-HXMT without occultationby the Earth.

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the GW counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales (1 s, 10 s) from the center 
of the LIGO-Virgo location probability map (RA=218.29 deg, DEC=65.30 deg), 
the 5-sigma upper-limits fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are 
reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1 s:   1.4e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  8.9e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1 s:   1.7e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.3e-06 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1 s:   3.6e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  2.3e-06 erg cm^-2

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the spacecraft.
