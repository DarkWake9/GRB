H. Swan (U. Michigan), C. Akerlof (U. Michigan), M. Skinner (AMOS 
Observatory, Boeing LTS), report on behalf of the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) began imaging GRB060930 (GCN 5665) Sept 30 
09:15:47.3 UTC, ~11 minutes after the GRB was detected, obtaining ~ 2 
hrs of images of the error box. We coadded 10s images into sets of
20. Comparison of these images with images taken on Oct 5th, 2006
reveals no optical counterpart within the 2.5 arc minute error radius.
We have a 3 sigma limiting magnitude of 21.0 for our coadded images.

[GCN OPS NOTE(19oct06): Per author's request, the Subject line was corrected
to the 060930 burst.]
