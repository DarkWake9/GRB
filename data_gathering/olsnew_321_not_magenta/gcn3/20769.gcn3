report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event G275697 at T0 = 2017-02-27
18:57:31.375 UTC, a preliminary analysis of the AGILE-GW fast data processing
procedure found no AGILE MiniCALorimeter (MCAL) event candidates within a
time interval covering -/+ 50 sec from the LIGO T0.

Two data acquisitions where collected about 30 sec before and 45 sec after
the LIGO T0; they show no significant transient candidate event. About 80%
of the LIGO error box was observable by the AGILE MCAL. A 3-sigma UL was
computed for a 1 s integration time, on different celestial positions within
the G275697 error box and varies from a minimum of 4.7e-7 erg cm^-2 to a
maximum of 11.3 e-7 erg cm^-2, assuming as spectral model a simple power law
with photon index 1.4. The AGILE-MCAL instrument is a CsI detector with a
4-pi FoV, working in the range 0.4 - 100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE
data is in progress.
