We have analysed 8.1 ks of XRT data for GRB 190613A, from 142 s to 18.3
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 127 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced
XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ.
24809).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=5.1 (+1.1, -0.9). At T+174 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of -1.500000 (+0.905300, -0.000007). The light
curve breaks again at T+207 s to a decay with alpha=5.0 (+0.7, -0.6), 
and  again at T+372 s s to alpha=1.44 (+0.18, -0.15),  before a final
break at T+7345 s s after which the decay index is -1.5 (+0.0, -1.4).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.01 (+/-0.12). The
best-fitting absorption column is  5.1 (+2.8, -2.6) x 10^20 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.5 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.75 (+0.22, -0.15)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 2.0 (+4.9, -0.5) x 10^20 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x 10^-11 (3.8 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     2.0 (+4.9, -0.5) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.5 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.75 (+0.22, -0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
-1.5, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.41 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.5 x
10^-11 (1.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
