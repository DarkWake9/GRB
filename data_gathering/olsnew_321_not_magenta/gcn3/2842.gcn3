GRB 041211: Infrared Observations

report:

"The 1.3m Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL;
http://pairitel.org) at Mt. Hopkins, AZ was used to autonomously observe
the HETE-2 SXC error circle of GRB 041211 (Dezalay et al.; GCN #2839) in
the J,H,Ks near-infrared bands.  Approximately 30 minutes of observations
were made between 12-12-2004 05:03:00 UT and 12-12-2004 05:54:00 UT of a
10'x10' field centered on RA=06:43:12 DEC=+20:23:42 (J2000). We detect no
new sources within or around the SXC error circle to the limiting
magnitude of 2MASS (approximately J=16.4, H=16.3, Ks=15.7). We note that
this data was obtained with the same instrument and filter set as the
archival 2MASS Atlas images but are significantly deeper than the 2MASS
limit. We will continue to monitor this field."

We are grateful for the assistance of the Mt. Hopkins Ridge staff. The
Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope is operated by the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and was made possible by a grant from the
Harvard University Milton Fund and the camera loan from the University of
Virginia.
