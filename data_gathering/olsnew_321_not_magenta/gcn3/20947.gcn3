MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in SAAO was pointed to the  Fermi trigger 512347439/GRB 
170327A (ra=18 26 16 dec=-33 27 00 r=5.3167)  2823 sec after notice time 
and 2870 sec after trigger time at 2017-03-27 23:31:45 UT in inspection 
mode.


MASTER-SAAO auto-detection system ( Lipunov et al., "MASTER Global Robotic  Net",
Advances in Astronomy, 2010, 30L ) discovered OT source
MASTER OT J184546.55-352847.6 
at (RA, Dec) = 18h 45m 46.55s -35d 28m 47.6s on 2017-03-28.06645 UT/

The OT's unfiltered magnitude is 17.0m (mlim=19.0).
There are only 2 images of this area (MASTER inspection mode) and OT is 
seen in both images on
Tstart=2017-03-28 01:35:41UT and
Tstart=2017-03-28 01:42:14UT with exposition duration 60s (each).

There is no minor planet at this place except (208700)_2002_JK with 
Vmag=20.4 and 0.6E,7.0S offset (doesn't have any connection with our OT).

We have reference image on 2016-05-14.93352 UT with unfiltered mlim= 
19.1m, the nearest in time images of this area are in MASTER-IAC database 
on 2016-07-31 23:23:26 with mlim=19.4.
There is no any sources in VIZIER database, it means 22mag limit in 
history

Deep photometry and Spectral observations are required.
The discovery and reference images are available at:

The observations made on zenit distance = 23.91 deg.
The distance to Moon was Dist. to Moon: 85.299167
The sun  altitude  was -58.18 degree.
