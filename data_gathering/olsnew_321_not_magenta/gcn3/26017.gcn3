a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 191016A by Swift (Gropp et al., GCNC 
26008), the BOOTES Network robotic telescopes automatically responded to 
this burst at the different astronomical stations worlwide.

The 60cm BOOTES-5/JGT robotic telescope at Observatorio Astronomico 
Nacional in San Pedro Martir (Mexico) gathered images (clear-filter) 
starting at 04:15:06U T (6.0 min after the GRB onset).

The 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) 
in Algarrobo Costa (Spain) obtained images (i-band filter) starting at 
04:15:15 UT (6.3 min after the GRB onset).

The 30cm BOOTES-1B robotic telescope at INTA-CEDEA in Mazagon (Huelva), 
southern Spain, imaged the field (clear filter) starting at 04:16:32 UT 
(7.5 min after the GRB onset).

The optical afterglow (Watson et al. GCNC 26010, Zheng et al. GCNC 
26011, Watson et al. GCNC 26015) is detected in all three BOOTES 
stations. Detailed data analysis is ongoing.

Follow-up observations were also triggered at the 1.5m OSN telescope in 
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada (Spain) starting at 19:56 UT 
(15.8 h after the GRB trigger). The afterglow was still detected in the 
R-band, for which we measure R = 19.8 +/- 0.1 (preliminary).

We thank the staff at Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro 
Martir, IHSM La Mayora, INTA-CEDEA and Observatorio de Sierra Nevada for 
the excellent support.
