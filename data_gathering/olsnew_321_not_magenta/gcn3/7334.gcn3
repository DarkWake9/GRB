The TAOS (Taiwan American Occultation Survey) telescopes responded to
GRB 071112C (Perri et al.,7059) and started to take images at 93s
after the burst (38s after the GCN notice time). The magnitude of
afterglow, compared with a nearby USNOB star, showed R~ 16.7 at 95.5s
after the burst. It is interesting to note that brightness of this
afterglow displayed a shallow decrease in our first few hundred
seconds. This behavior was also mentioned by Yuan et al. (GCN 7061)
in the ROTSE-IIIc observations. The further data analysis is ongoing.
