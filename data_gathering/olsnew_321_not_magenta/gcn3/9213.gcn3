SUBJECT: GRB 090423:  Correction to NIR photometry

FROM:    Antonino Cucchiara at PSU  <cucchiara@astro.psu.edu>

A. Cucchiara, D. B. Fox (PSU), and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"Further analysis of our Gemini+NIRI H-band imaging (Cucchiara, Fox &
Berger, GCN 9209) has led to a significant correction in the H-band
magnitudes for the afterglow/host (Tanvir et al., GCN 9202) of GRB
090423 (Kimm et al., GCN 9198).  Our revised magnitudes for this
object are:

J mag: 19.29 +- 0.07
H mag: 18.57 +- 0.07

The revision to the H-band magnitude, in addition to the absence of
any detection in our Y-band images, suggests a break in the spectrum
below or within the J-band and above the Y-band, yielding, e.g., 7<~z<~9
in a Lyman-alpha interpretation.

Further analysis is in progress and additional observations are planned.

We apologize for any inconvenience."
