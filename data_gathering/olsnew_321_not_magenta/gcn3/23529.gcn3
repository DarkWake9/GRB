TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  23529
SUBJECT: GRB181213A: Swift/UVOT Detection
DATE:    18/12/13 14:28:38 GMT
FROM:    Mike Siegel at PSU/Swift MOC  <mhs18@psu.edu>

M. H. Siegel (PSU) and P. A. Evans (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:
 
UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 2352 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
 RA(J2000)  =	16:33:04.87 = 248.27028
 DEC(J2000) = +78:29:48.8  =  78.49690
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.75 arc sec. This position is 2.2
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle and consistent with the optical
afterglow reported by MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCN Circ. 23526) and BOOTES
(Hu et al., GCN Circ. 23527). The estimated magnitude is
17.26 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.04.
