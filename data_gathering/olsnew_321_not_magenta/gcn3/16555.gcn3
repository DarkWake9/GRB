E. Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:13:41.38 UT on 09 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140709A (trigger 426561224 / 140709051).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (L. Hagen et al., GCN 16546)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 111 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 70s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-25 s to T0+45 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.10 +/- 0.07 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 126 +/- 9 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.8 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+15.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
