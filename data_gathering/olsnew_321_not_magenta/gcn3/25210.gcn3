IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

This is an update of GCN 25197 including updated p-values for the map
circulated in the 5-Update GCN notice.

Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent
with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate S190728q in a
time range of 1000 seconds [1] centered on the alert event time (2019-07-28
06:36:50.529 UTC to 2019-07-28 06:53:30.529 UTC) have been performed.
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. Two
hypothesis tests were conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood
analysis which searches for a generic point-like neutrino source coincident
with the given GW skymap [2]. The second uses a Bayesian approach to
quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which assumes a binary
merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors in the
significance estimate, such as GW source distance [3].

One track-like event is found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the
gravitational-wave candidate S190728q calculated from the map circulated in
the 5-Update notice. This represents an overall p-value of 0.014 (2.21
sigma) from the generic transient search and an overall p-value of 0.010
(2.33 sigma) for the Bayesian search. These p-values measure the
consistency of the observed track-like events with the known atmospheric
backgrounds.

The reported p-values can differ due to the estimated distance of the GW
candidate. The distance is used as a prior in Bayesian binary merger
search, while it is not taken into account in the generic transient
point-like source search.

Properties of the coincident events are shown below.

   dt|ra (deg)|dec (deg)|Angular Uncertainty(deg)|p-value
(bayesian)|p-value(generic transient)

where:
dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger. Angular
uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle
representing 90% CL containment by area.
p-value = the p-value for this specific track event from each search.
RA & Dec = Right ascension and declination in degrees quoted in J2000 epoch
