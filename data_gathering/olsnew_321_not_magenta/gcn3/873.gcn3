K Hurley (UCB) report on behalf of the Super-LOTIS collaboration:

Super-LOTIS obtained images of the field around the short/hard burst 
GRB001025B (Hurley et al.,GCNC 865) with the 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope 
located at Kitt Peak, AZ on Oct 27.08 UT and 30.09 UT (30 and 102 hours 
after the burst) covering 100% of the IPN error box. The images were taken 
with 50 s integration time without a filter. A preliminary comparison 
of the two images revealed no new objects brighter than mV ~18.9
(10-sigma limit). Further analysis is in progress.
