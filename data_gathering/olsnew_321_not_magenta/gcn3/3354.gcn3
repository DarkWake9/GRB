K. Sanchawala, Y.L. Wu, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip(NCU), Y. Urata, (RIKEN), 
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA), on behalf of EAFON report:

" We have imaged the error region of GRB 050504(GCN 3348) using 1-m
telescope at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. The R band observations ( 60s
x 15 frames) started from 13.27 UT to 13.55 UT (~ 5.26 hours to 5.54
hours after the burst). The limiting magnitude of R band co-added
image is R ~ 21 compared with USNOB1.0 stars. No new source was found
down to the limiting magnitude.
