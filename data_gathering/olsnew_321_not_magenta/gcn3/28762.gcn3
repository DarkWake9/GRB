Due to a typo, the OT datetime data in the table(GCN 28760) was wrong
Here are the correct values

  T-Tmid      Date      Time       Expt.        Ra                Dec         Mag
---------|---------------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----
       66   2020-10-24 02:51:20     10   (08h 23m 48.58s,   +03d 21m 13.8s) 14.9

The OT position is coincident with UVOT and XRT position. The afterglow appears to be fading rapidly.
