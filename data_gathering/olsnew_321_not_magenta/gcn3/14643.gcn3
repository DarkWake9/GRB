We observed the field of GRB 130514A (Sonbas et al., GCN 14632) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/05 14.30 to 2013/05 14.46 UTC (4.7 minutes
to 3.90 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.49 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 1.04 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with USNO-B1
and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r' > 23.51
  i' > 23.39
  Z  > 22.07
  Y  > 21.62
  J  > 21.43
  H  > 21.13

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Schmidl et al. (GCN Circular 14634) report a source with r = 20.0 and i =
19.2 in images taken from 2 to 6 minutes after the BAT trigger. Perley
(GCN Circular 14633) reports a marginal detection in r and z in images
taken from 12 to 27 minutes after the BAT trigger. We began exposing on
this field less than 5 minutes after the BAT trigger, but due to the
high airmass of almost 5 and poor transparency on the south-eastern
horizon, our first useful images are not until about 17 minutes after
the trigger. The evolution of our 3-sigma limits is:

  i' > 21.72 at 0.49 hours after the trigger   
  i' > 22.48 at 1.14 hours
  i' > 23.00 at 1.59 hours
  i' > 23.17 at 2.02 hours
  i' > 23.24 at 2.60 hours
  i' > 23.30 at 3.34 hours
  i' > 23.39 at 3.90 hours

If we extrapolate the Schmidl et al. measurement of i = 19.2 at 4 minutes
according to t^-1, we would expect to have detected their source in our
observations out to 2 hours. That we did not suggests that light curve
fell faster than this. We note that quick-look light curve for Swift-XRT
falls by almost three orders of magnitude between about 3 minutes and 20
minutes, which may be consistent with a rapid optical decay.

Mártir.
