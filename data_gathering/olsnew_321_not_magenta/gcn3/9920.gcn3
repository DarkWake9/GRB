Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), Brian Murphy
(Butler University), and Kenneth Rumstay (Valdosta State University)
report:

We observed the field of GRB 090915 (Cummings & Markwardt GCN 9912,
Fermi-GBM trigger 274721737) using the 0.9m SARA telescope located at Kitt
Peak National Observatory beginning 44173 seconds after the burst and
continuing for about half an hour.  Observations were carried out under
good weather conditions at high airmass.

In 21 minutes of stacked exposures, we marginally detect a source within
the XRT error circle (Beardmore, Page, & Sakamoto, GCN 9914) at R ~ 20.5
+/- 0.3 (as compared to field stars using the USNO B1.0 catalog).  The
object is not found in the DSS catalog.  Variability can not be
established from these single-epoch observations.  It is likely that the
above source is the same identified by Hoversten & Sakamoto (GCN 9918). 
To establish the decay, follow-up observations are encouraged.
