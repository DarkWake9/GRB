Using the data set from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170906B (trigger #770958)
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN Circ. 21822).

Because this burst occurred only 755 s after the trigger time of GRB 170906A
(trigger #770957), data collection was interrupted, and as such we do not have
event-by-event data during the burst. Thus most of the usual BAT data products
that we usually report in the "refined analysis circular" are not available.

The BAT raw light curve shows roughly two overlapping pulses that start
at ~T-11 s and ends at ~T+7 s. The two peaks occur at ~T-5 s and ~T0,
respectively.

The results of the BAT analysis are available at
