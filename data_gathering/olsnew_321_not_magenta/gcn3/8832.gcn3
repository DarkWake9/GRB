Y. Minowa, T.-S. Pyo, H. Terada, K. Aoki (Subaru, NAOJ), and
N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team:

We observed the field of GRB 090118 (GCN 8825, Copete et al.) with
IRCS on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope in J band beginning 39.2 hours 
after the burst (18 min exposure, mid-time 05:10 UT, Jan. 20).
The afterglow candidate reported by Updike et al. (GCN 8829, 8831)
was detected with J=21.3 mag, where the magnitude is estimated using
nearby 2MASS stars.
