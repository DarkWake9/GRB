Using the data set from T-239 to T+831 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130727A (trigger #564342)
(Strohe, et al., GCN Circ. 15046).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 330.790, -65.540 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 03m 09.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 32' 23.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-5 sec and ening at ~T+30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 13.57 +- 0.81 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.08 to T+24.38 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.65 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
