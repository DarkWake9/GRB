R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 14:40:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRS 1716-249/GRO J1719-24/V2293 Oph (trigger=731257).  Swift did not
slew because of Sun constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 259.901, -24.998, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 19m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = -24d 59' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve does not show anything
significant, as it typical for image triggers (duration is 11.9 min in this case). 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 13:53 UT on 2017 January 27. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time.
