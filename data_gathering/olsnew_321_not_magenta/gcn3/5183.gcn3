report:

We observed the field around position of optical counterpart of
GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162; French & Jelinek GCN 5165; Rykoff et
al. GCN 5166) with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150,
Bakirlitepe,TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). The observations were
made in Rc in two epochs: May 28, 20:07UT and May 29, 00:53UT (~51.64
and ~56.41 hours after the burst). The afterglow is detected clearly in
Rc bands in both epochs.

We estimate the following Rc magnitudes for the OT:

    t-t0  m_R     err
   51.64  21.464  0.04
   56.41  21.816  0.05

The last value indicates that the afterglow light curve had returned to
the extrapolated power-law decay with index -1.2 which was found between
5 and 16 hours of post-burst reported by Khamitov et al. (GCN 5173),
Halpern et al. (GCN 5176) and Cobb et al. (GCN 5180).
