We have obtained a refined XRT position, using the ground-based pipeline 
processing software, including stellar aberration correction.  The refined 
position for the X-ray afterglow is: RA(J2000) = 12:51:30.4, Dec(J2000) = 
+13:02:39.0.  We estimate a remaining uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds, 
including a systematic error of about 5 arcseconds due to residual 
alignment offsets that have not been fully calibrated yet.

We now have data from 3 orbits.  Data were collected between 14:35:15 and 
15:17:12 UT, between 16:11:35 and 16:53:41 UT, and between 17:48:02 and 
18:30:03.  The point source is clearly fading, with average observed count 
rates 0.20 cps, 0.14 cps, and 0.09 cps in the three observations.

A preliminary spectral fit to data from the first orbit gives a spectral 
power law photon index of  1.3 +/- 0.1, assuming Galactic absorption (2E20 
cm^-2).  The average estimated unabsorbed 1-5 keV flux is then about 6E-12 
erg cm^-2 s^-1 at about 3.5 hours post-burst.
