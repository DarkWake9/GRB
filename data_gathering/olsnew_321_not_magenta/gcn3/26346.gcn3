B. Sbarufatti (PSU) ), J. D. Gropp (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 191130A (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 26327),
collecting 5.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+310.0 ks
and T0+343.5 ks. 

Three uncatalogued sources were detected, all of them too far from the
GRB position to be likely afterglow candidates.

The 3-sigma upper limit at the BAT position is 1.19e-3 ct s^-1,
corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 6.0e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020950.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
