MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope located in Russia (Applied Physics Institute, Irkutsk State University)
was pointed to the  FERMI GRB190406.47 ( 19h  5m 21.60s , +61d 30m 00.00s, R=7.09)
7843 sec after trigger time at 2019-04-06 13:20:30 UT, with upper limit up to  19.8 mag.
Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenit distance = 65 deg. The sun  altitude  is -14.6 deg.

MASTER auto-detection system didn't find OT connected with GRB.

During inspection we find OT

MASTER OT J193011.47+465928.3 detection - preliminary dwarf nova outburst, ampl>4.3m

MASTER-Kislovodsk auto-detection system (Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, v. 2010, 30L)
discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 19h 30m 11.47s +46d 59m 28.3s on 2019-04-07.95397 UT.
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 15.4m (limit 19.0m).

The OT is seen in 8 images. There is no minor planet at this place.

We have reference image without OT on 2019-02-13.08602 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 19.6m, on 2016-07-29 21:12:44 with mlim=19.7, it means 
more then 4.3m of current outburst amplitude (there is USNO-B1 star in 0.3" with B1=19.5,R2=19.3).

Spectral observations are required.

The discovery and reference images are available at:
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/193011.47465928.3.png

We checked coordinates of 4 ZTF candidates (Ahumada et al. GCN24130) in 
MASTER database  and didn't find OT at position of 3 ones since 2009y (up to unfiltered 20.0)

About ZTF19aapfxqv
MASTER has seen an object at the position 
18h 27m 39.96s , +65d 37m 33.70s (MASTER OT J182739.96+653733.70) 
on 2017-12-07 21:15:28.334UT with m_OT=18.3+-0.2 (and we should note there 
is PanSTARRs source in 5.7").
