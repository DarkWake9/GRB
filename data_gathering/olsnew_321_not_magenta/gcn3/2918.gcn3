At 10:49:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB041228.  The spacecraft did not autonomously slew
to the burst since automated slewing was not yet enabled.

The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 336.641,+5.050 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 5 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a systematic
uncertainty).  The lightcurve is multi-peaked with a main emission duration
of ~40 s, with 36 counts/cm^2 fluence and a peak (1 second interval)
of ~1.2 counts/cm^2/s in the 15-350 keV band.  And there appears to be
extended emission for another 80 sec.
