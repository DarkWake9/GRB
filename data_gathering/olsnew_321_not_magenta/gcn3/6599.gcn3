We report further analysis of the bright long GRB 070626
localized by IPN (Golenetskii  et al., GCN 6592).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.91(-0.13, +0.16)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+73.216 s
1.94(-0.16, +0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+187.905 s: this interval comprises ~93%
of the burst total counts) can be fitted
(in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.45 (-0.03, +0.04),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.28 (-0.12, +0.08),
the peak energy Ep = 226 (-17, +19) keV (chi2 = 79/68 dof).

The spectrum of the burst maximum
(accumulated from T0+72.192 s to T0+74.752 s)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.27 (-0.07, +0.08),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.51 (-0.88, +0.27),
the peak energy Ep = 355 (-62, +69) keV (chi2 = 77/69 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
