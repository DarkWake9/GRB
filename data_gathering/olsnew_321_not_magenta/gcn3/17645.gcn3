report:

We observed the field of GRB 150220A (P.A. Evans, GCN Circ. 17501) with
0.7-m f/4 reflector of Kyiv comet station (Marsden's number – 585).
The telescope is equipped with CCD, 10271056 pixels with a scale of
0.95"/px. We obtained 2160sec images in R-filter on Mar., 10, 2015,
from (UTC) 19:08:15 to 19:44:09. Purpose of our observations was not to
search for the afterglow candidate. We would like to find two objects
referred to in (V. V. Golovnya, V. M. Andruk, GCN 17589), which was 
found on the old archive photographic plates in close vicinity of the
position of source '1SXPS J090208.3-014021':

RA,Dec(J2000)= 09h02m12.961s  -01d40'24.457"
        and    09 02 13.504   -01 39 51.118

The CCD images were processed with the standard technique and co-added
together to create a frame with higher signal/noise ratio. We did not 
find above mentioned objects on the CCD, but we confirmed some of the
positions reported early by P.A. Evans (GCN 17501). The following table
gives the positions listed by Evans, as well as the positions some 
of the objects calculated from the CCD.
