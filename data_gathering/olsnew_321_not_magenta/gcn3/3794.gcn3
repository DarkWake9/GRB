FROM:    Weidong Li at UC Berkeley KAIT/LOSS  <weidong@astron.berkeley.edu>

W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

"The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB050813 detected with Swift
(Trigger 150139; Retter et al. GCN 3788, Sato et al. GCN 3793).
A series of images was automatically obtained from 06:45:49 UT
(39s after the burst) to 07:20:36 UT (2126s after the burst).
The sequence includes a combination of images taken with the V
and I filters, as well as some that are unfiltered. We did not
detect a new object in our images when compared to the DSS II
images. In particular, no new object was found within the error
circle of the Swift XRT position as reported by Morris et al.
(GCN 3790). Our first 20s unfiltered image started at 39.2s after
the burst has a limiting magnitude of about 18.6 when compared to
the USNO-B1.0 catalog."
