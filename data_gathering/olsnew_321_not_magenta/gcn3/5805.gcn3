J. A. Kennea, J. L. Racusin, D. N. Burrows and D. Grupe (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

At 22:52UT the Swift/XRT began observing GRB 061110B (GCN 5800). In
analysis of quicklook data we detect a faint uncatalogue point source at
the following location:

RA(J2000):  21h 35m 40.4s
Dec(J2000): +6d 52m 36.0s

with an estimated uncertainty of 9.6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This position lies 1.9 arcseconds from the Liverpool Telescope afterglow
candidate (GCN 5804) and 62 arcseconds from the BAT position. It is not
possible to determine at this time if this source is fading.
