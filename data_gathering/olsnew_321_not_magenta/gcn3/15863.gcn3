R. Starling (U. Leicester) reports:

We observed the position of the Integral weak transient #6467 with Swift on
19th February 2014 starting at 18:37 UT, 2.5 hours after the Integral trigger.

We do not detect any source in the XRT field of view in a 2.98 ks observation. 
The 3-sigma upper limit on the 0.3-10 keV count rate at the Integral position 
(RA, Dec: 204.097, -45.0619 deg) is 0.003 count/s. 

We thank the Swift team for carrying out this rapid ToO.
