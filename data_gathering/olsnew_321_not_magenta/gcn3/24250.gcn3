Gravitational Wave Hunters

The non-zero value of Prob_MassGap identifies S190426c (GCN24237) as a 
possible strongly-lensed NS-NS merger - i.e. its true redshift and 
luminosity distance may be larger, and true mass may be smaller than 
inferred by LIGO/Virgo.  The rate of such detections is predicted to be 
~0.01 per Earth year during O3.

The putative lens could be an individual galaxy, or a group/cluster of 
galaxies.  None of the 130 known strong-lensing clusters in the sample 
discussed by Smith et al. (2018) are located in the updated 90% credible 
sky localization released an hour after detection and stated as the 
currently preferred skymap in GCN24237.

At the estimated luminosity distance to the source (D_L~375Mpc; 
GCN24237) an AT2017gfo-like counterpart would have an apparent B/V-band 
magnitude of AB<~24.5 within ~2 days of the LIGO/Virgo detection.  This 
estimate (albeit redshifted in to the i-band, and time-dilated to ~4 
days post-detection) is also valid if the source is strongly-lensed and 
actually at a redshift of z~1.

We encourage colleagues to observe the sky localization of this source 
down to AB~25, to search for a kilonova-like counterpart, and thus 
explore the possibility that this source is strongly-lensed, for example 
by a massive galaxy or group of galaxies.
