Gergely Dálya and Peter Raffai (Eotvos Univ.) reports on behalf of the
GLADE team:

We have found 45,033 galaxies in the GLADE catalog [1], within the 90% GW
localization area reported by the LVC in GCN 24168, and within 155 +/- 45
Mpc
distance limits.

The galaxies found can be accessed on the GLADE website (12 MB txt file;
please note that the order of galaxies in the list only follow the ordering
as the appear in GLADE):

There are 13,330 galaxies within the 50% GW localization area and within
the same distance limits (3.6 MB txt file; please note that the order of
galaxies in the list only follow the ordering as the appear in GLADE):
