report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed follow-up observations of the Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 220426A (GCN Circ. 31950, 31955), which was also detected by Swift/BAT-GUANO (GCN Circ. 31954), Konus-Wind (GCN Circ. 31959), INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, and HEND/Mars-Odyssey (GCN Circ. 31958).

The XRT observations consist of three tiles of 1 ks each, to cover the GRB error region. The data were acquired between 45 and 47 hours after the burst and are entirely in PC mode.

One bright, uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0): 22h 32m 34.33s
  Dec (J2000.0): -22° 57′ 01.0″
  Error: 3.7 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (1.4 +/- 0.5)e-2 ct s^-1
  Distance: 3.2 arcmin from the IPN position
  Flux: (4.1 +/- 1.4)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Nevertheless, we note that at the XRT position the RASS PSPC 3 sigma upper limit is 0.05 cts/s (XRT equivalent count-rate).

The UVOT took images of 616s each on the three XRT tiles with the white filter 160-170 ks after the trigger. We identify one source at 1.9” from the XRT coordinates of Source 1,  with a white magnitude of 18.01.

The UVOT position is:
   RA  (J2000) =  22:32:34.39 = 338.14330 (deg.)
   Dec (J2000) = -22:57:02.7  =  22.95074 (deg.)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arc sec. (radius, 90% confidence).

However, we note that this is a known source in the DSS and is therefore unlikely to be the afterglow. No other sources are detected to a limiting magnitude in the white filter of 20.8.

More Swift observations are planned in the next days to assess for variability
