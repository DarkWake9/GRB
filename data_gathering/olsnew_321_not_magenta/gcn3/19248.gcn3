The long-duration GRB 160324A (INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7431; Konus-Wind trigger time on 
15:58:32.877 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 15:58:38.0 on 
24 March 2016.  No real time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because 
the real time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal) between 15:51 and 16:13.  
The burst signal was seen by SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows at least two main episodes with a possible low level 
emission before the first episode.  The low-level emission starts at T0-30 sec.  The 
first episode starts at T0-5 sec, peaks at T0-3 sec and ends at T0+5 sec.  The second 
episode starts at T0+6 sec, peaks at T0+8sec and ends at T0+14 sec.  The T90 duration 
measured by the SGM data is 42 +- 2 sec (40-450 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
