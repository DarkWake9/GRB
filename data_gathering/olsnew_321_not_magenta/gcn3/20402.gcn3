At event time for G268556 the detectors BDRG-1 and BDRG-2 on-board 
Lomonosov were directed  >60 degrees far from all regions present on LIGO 
probability map for G268556. BDRG-3 detector observed the southern high 
probability region directed to RA=25.8, Dec=-30.7. The Lomonosov satellite 
was located over South Africa at outer regions of SAA leading to high 
background. No burst-like events were observed, the 3 sigma upper limit 
for 1s-long GRB flux in 20-800 keV range is 2.5 cm-2*s-1.
The time intervals when the region of maximal probability of GW source was 
in BDRG FOV on 04.01.2017 from 9h to 13h are   9:07-9:27, 9:33-9:47, 
10:42-11:02, 11:07-11:24, 12:17-12:37, 12:42-12:59. No on-board 
GRB-triggers were generated at this time intervals.
BDRG on-board triggers were generated 4 times during the time period from 
10 hours before GW event to 10 hours after it  (at 02:33:17, 0 4:12:19, 
08:06:49 and 13:36:41).The significance of all these triggers do not 
exceed 9.5 sigma correspondent to the level of random events occurring ~10 
times per day. The  upper limit for 1s-GRB flux in 50-300 keV is 0.5 
cm-2*s-1 equivalent to 1e-7 erg/cm2 for typical GRB spectra.
