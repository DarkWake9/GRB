The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analysed offline noise-subtracted data for the LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L), and Virgo (V) detectors
around the time of the binary black hole event G297595 / GW170814 (GCNs
21474, 21493) taking into account our most up-to-date understanding of
both calibration and waveform modelling uncertanties.

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference (Veitch et al.,
PRD 91, 042003) and a new sky map, LALInference_v1.fits.gz, is available
for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G297595

The 50% and 90% credible regions span about 13 and 62 square degrees,
respectively.

This is the preferred sky map at this time, and the version that will
appear in LVC 2017 (Physical Review Letters, in press).
