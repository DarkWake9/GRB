and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 180113A (Ukwatta et al., GCN circ. 22325; Veres et al.,
GCN circ. 22328; Frederiks et al., GCN circ. 22344) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:47:03.27 on 13 January 2018.  The burst
signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two overlapping pulses.  The emission
starts at T+3 sec, peaks at T+4 sec and ends at T+16 sec.  The T90 and
the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 11.3 +- 1.3 sec and
7.0 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
