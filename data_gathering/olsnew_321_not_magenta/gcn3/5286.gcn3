Peter J. Brown (Penn State) & Stephen T. Holland (NASA/GSFC & USRA)
report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

Swift has been continuing to monitor the counterpart to
GRB060614 (Parsons et al. GCN 5252).  The UVOT U band light curve,
which was nearly flat during the period of 2-10 days after the
burst at U~22.5 (Holland GCN 5281) has faded to U~24.0 +/- 0.7
(this last point being a 2.7 sigma detection from data taken
between 15-23 days after the burst).

The timing and shape of the plateau and subsequent decay are
very similar to the U band light curve of GRB060218/SN2006aj
(Campana et al. Nature, in press, astro-ph/0603279).
At a redshift of 0.125 (Price, Berger, & Fox GCN 5275),
the possible SN component has an absolute U magnitude about
2 magnitudes fainter than SN2006aj.

We encourage observations at other wavelengths to determine
whether the flattening previously observed (Fynbo et al. GCN 5277;
Cobb & Bailyn GCN 5282) is from the host galaxy or whether a
contributing SN component has since faded.
