Indian GRB collaboration)

We observed GRB 121128A (Swift trigger 539866, Oates et al. 2012, GCN
Circ.14007) field with the 1.04m telescope at ARIES, Nainital starting at
2012-11-28 14:02:55 (UT). Several images in R_c and I_c pass-bands were 
obtained.

The optical afterglow  candidate ( Oates et al. 2012, GCN Circ.14007,
Japelj 
et al. 2012, GCN Circ. 14008) was clearly detected in our frames. The
preliminary photometry of the co-added R_c (300sec x 3) and I_c (300sec x
3) frames yield following magnitudes.
