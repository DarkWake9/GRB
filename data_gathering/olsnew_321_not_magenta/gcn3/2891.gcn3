" We have observed the position of infrared afterglow candidate
reported by Blake et al. (GCN 2870) at Lulin (Taiwan, 1-m telescope)
and XingLong (China, 0.8 m telescope) Observatory. The R band
observations are summarized as below:

 Start Time (UTC)   Filter      Exposure (sec)  Limit mag.   Site
                                                 (SN=3)             
  Dec. 9.47           R       300 x 2 + 600 x 2   >~ 21      Lulin
  Dec. 9.48           R       300 x 1 + 360 x 1   >~ 20      XingLong
 
Limiting magnitudes were estimated by comparison with several
USNO-B1.0 stars. The candidate was not detected brighter than the
limiting magnitudes."
