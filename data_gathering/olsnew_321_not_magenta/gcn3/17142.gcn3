D. Xu (DARK/NBI), H.-B. Niu, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 141205A (Cummings, GCN 17137), using the
1m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations were
performed between 17:26:18 UT and 21:26:52 UT on 2014-12-05, and a
series of R-band 120s/200s exposures were obtained. No credible
uncatalogued optical transient was found within the BAT error circle
(Markwardt et al., GCN 17140), down to a limiting magnitude of R~20.4
mag.
