We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m
Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 28.29 to 2014/11 28.54 UTC (171.20 to 177.06 hours
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.62 hours exposure in the r, i,
and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS DR9,
we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

r = 21.87 +/- 0.05
i = 21.62 +/- 0.05
z > 21.03

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Compared to our previous observations (Butler et al., GCN 17101; Watson et al.,
GCN 17105), the afterglow continues to fade roughly as t^-1.7.
