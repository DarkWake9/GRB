Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of the
GBM-detected burst GRB 200325B (Fermi GBM team, GCN Cir. 27441),
collecting overall 4.6 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+102.4 ks and T0+505.5 ks. 

The uncatalogued X-ray source (Source 1) reported in D'Avanzo et al.
(GCN Circ. 27457) has faded with alpha >1.2, confirming that this is
the GRB afterglow. 

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the afterglow are at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020978/Source1.php.
The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
