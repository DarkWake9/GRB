WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150910A (Pagani
et al., GCN 18264) starting at 09:34:20 UT, ~30 minutes after
the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. The UVOT afterglow reported by Pagani et al. (GCN 18264)
was clearly detected in all filters. The brightness is about R~16.2 mag
at ~30 minutes after the burst, and is decreasing.
Follow-up observations are encouraged.
