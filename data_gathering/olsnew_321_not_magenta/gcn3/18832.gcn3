FROM:    Chris Copperwheat at LJMU ArI  <c.m.copperwheat@ljmu.ac.uk>

We report the following spectroscopic observations and classifications
of two of the EM candidates reported by Cenko et al. in GCN 18762. All
observations were obtained using the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope, La
Palma by C.M. Copperwheat, I.A. Steele & A. Piascik (Liverpool JMU) on
behalf of a wider collaboration.

iPTF-15ffm was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on 2016-01-03 at
19:49UT. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) we
classify this transient as a type Ia supernova with z = 0.098 at 30
days after peak.

iPTF-15fhd was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on 2016-01-03 at
21:02UT.  Using SNID we classify this transient as a type Ia supernova
with z = 0.088 at 13 days after peak.
