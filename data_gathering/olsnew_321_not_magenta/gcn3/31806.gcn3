The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 12:28:09 UT on 30 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220330A (trigger 670336094.273364 / 220330520).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 324.1, Dec = 63.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 36m, 63d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 28.0 degrees.
