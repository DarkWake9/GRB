report:

We observed the field of GRB 131202A (Kocevski, et al., GCN 15559) with 
the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on 
the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional 
on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/12 3.08 to 2013/12 3.15 UTC (10.81
to 12.32 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.04 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.44 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with 
2MASS, we
obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r	> 22.99
   i	> 22.56
   Z	> 21.50
   Y	> 20.68
   J	> 20.43
   H	> 20.05

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for 
Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San 
Pedro
Mártir.
