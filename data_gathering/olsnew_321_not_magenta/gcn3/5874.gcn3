A.J. van der Horst, R.A.M.J. Wijers (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol
(University of Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 061121 afterglow at 4.8 and
8.6 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at November 27
14.11 UT to 20.88 UT, i.e. 5.95 - 6.23 days after the burst (GCN 5823).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical afterglow
(GCN 5824). The three-sigma rms noise in het map around that position is
126 microJy per beam at 4.8 GHz, and 129 microJy per beam at 8.6 GHz.
The formal flux measurement for a point source at the location of the
optical afterglow is 7 +/- 42 microJy at 4.8 GHz, and -20 +/- 43 microJy
at 8.6 GHz.

We would like to thank the staff of the Australia Telescope National
Facility, in particular Philip Edwards, for obtaining these
Target of Opportunity observations."
