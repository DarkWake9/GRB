M. Yoshida, K. Yanagisawa, Y. Shimizu, S. Nagayama (OAO, NAOJ)
and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We performed optical imaging observation (g', Rc, and Ic) of the
field of GRB 080212 (Ziaeepour et al. GCN 7296) with 50cm MITSuME
telescope at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory from UT 17:36:37
(124 sec after the trigger) to UT 20:30:38 on Feb 12 2008.

We found a 18 mag star in the vicinity of the XRT position (Goad
et al. GCN 7300). This is the late-K star reported by Berger (GCN
7304). Although we could not spatially resolve the faint source
close to this star reported by Berger (GCN7304), we found that
a fading component is overlaid on the star. This component is
a GRB afterglow candidate. We estimated the magnitudes of the
fading component by subtracting the flux of the star at 2 hours
after the trigger from the star magnitude at early time.

The estimated magnitudes of the fading component are summarized
below.
