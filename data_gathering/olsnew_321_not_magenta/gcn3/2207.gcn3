K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 07451
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
25 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  7.1E-06 erg/cm2, and
a peak flux of approximately  5.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 332.305, -36.886 degrees, whose radius is 38.405 +/-  0.070
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but at this point
it is not known whether the event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and
thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
