The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:42:47 UT on 9 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211109B (trigger 658118572.33636 / 211109113).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 252.8, Dec = -45.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 51m, -45d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.0 degrees.
