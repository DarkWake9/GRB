J. S. Bloom, D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) and H.W. Chen (Chicago) report,

"Following the detection of the optical afterglow (GCN 5823, GCN 5824, 
GCN 5825), we obtained approximately 8 spectroscopic exposures of 
120-180 seconds each, beginning at ~15:36 UT with the Keck I 10m 
telescope + LRIS.

The afterglow is strongly detected in all exposures.  Based on a 
preliminary wavelength solution, we identify in absorption a doublet and 
singlet complex which we identify as redshifted Mg I 2853 Ang, Mg II 
2796, 2804 Ang at z = 1.314. We suggest this is redshift of GRB 0611121. 
Further analysis is ongoing."
