P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 190515B, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 98.8489, 52.3168 which
is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 06 35 23.73
   Dec (J2000) = +52 19 00.4
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence).
Analysis of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/903845.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
