D. A. Perley (Caltech), M. Kasliwal (Carnegie), L. P. Singer, Y. Cao 
(Caltech), and K. Tinyanont (Harvey Mudd) report:

Beginning at 12:57 UT on 2014-06-08 we observed the field of iPTF14bfu 
(Singer et al., GCN 16360), the optical counterpart of GRB 140606B 
(Burns et al., GCN 16363), using the imaging mode of MOSFIRE on the Keck 
I 10m telescope. A sequence of nine 23-second images was acquired in the 
Ks filter.

Calibrating relative to 2MASS stars in the image, we measure a magnitude of:

Ks = 19.50 +/- 0.06  (Vega, or Ks = 21.34 AB)

at a mid-time of 2.411 days after the initial trigger.

We also measure an improved astrometric position (relative to 2MASS) of:
21:52:29.961 +32:00:50.66  (J2000, +/- 0.2")
