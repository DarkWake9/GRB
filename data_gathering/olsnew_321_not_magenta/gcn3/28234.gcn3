The long GRB 200806A (Swift detection: Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 28211,
Lien et al., GCN Circ. 28223; AstroSat CZTI detection: Gupta et al.,
GCN Circ. 28216; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200806A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 15:28:52.289 UTC
on 6 August 2020. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because
the real-time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T-2.7 sec, peaks at T+20.0 sec and ends at T+40.9 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 33.4 +- 3.1 sec
and 14.5 +- 2.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
