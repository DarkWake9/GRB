(U. Leicester) and E.A. Helder report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 10 ks of XRT data for GRB 121123A (Helder  et al. GCN
Circ. 13982), from 129 s to 23.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 669 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec =
307.3183, -11.85898 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 20 29 16.39
Dec(J2000): -11 51 32.3

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The late-time light curve (from T0+4.7 ks) can be modelled with  a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.50 (+/-0.09).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.448 (+0.023, -0.022). The
best-fitting absorption column is  8.9 (+/-0.6) x 10^20 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 4.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.97 (+/-0.11) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 5.8 (+2.3, -1.8) x 10^20 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.6 x 10^-11 (4.2 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     5.8 (+2.3, -1.8) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 4.0 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.97 (+/-0.11)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.50, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.051 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.8 x
10^-12 (2.1 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
