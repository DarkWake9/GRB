S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The long GRB 050713A (Swift-BAT trigger #145675; 
Falcone et al., GCN 3581, Palmer et al., GCN 3597)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=16141.745 s UT (04:29:01.745).
As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~16 s,
fluence (1.22 ± 0.08)10-5 erg/cm2,
peak flux on 64-ms time scale (1.7 ± 0.4)10-6  erg/cm2 s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).
Konus-Wind did not detect additional smaller peaks,
reported by Swift-BAT.
Probably they were too weak to be detected by Konus-Wind.

The spectrum integrated over the most instense part of the GRB
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted (in 20 keV-4 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) exp(-E/E0) 
with alpha = 1.12 +/- 0.08,
and E0 = 355 ± 70 keV.
The peak energy Ep = 312 ± 50 keV.
