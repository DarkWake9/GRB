on behalf of the Swift team report:


At Sat 03 Sep 05 05:35:44 UT, BAT detected a possible peak in an
image and reported it as a transient (Trigger #153355). This trigger 
is a low-significance peak in the vicinity of, but not coincident 
with, a previously detected low-significance peak. Therefore it is 
unlikely to be an astrophysical source of any kind, but rather
an chance image fluctuation.
