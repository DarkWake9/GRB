S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-GRB collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050421 (GCN #3296) with the automated
Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of 17 x 120 s images
in the Kron R band, taken at a mean epoch of 08:50 UT (~ 4.6 hours after
the burst).  We find no sources in the XRT error circle reported in GCN
#3296.  Our 3.0-sigma limiting magnitude, estimated by comparison with
several stars from the Guide Star Catalog, is approximately R < 22.0.
