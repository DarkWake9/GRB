S.Y. Fu, Z.P. Zhu, X. Liu, D. Xu (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 Senior High 
School), X. Zhang, J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200906A (Page et al., GCN 28371) using the 
NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We only 
obtained 2x120s frames in the Sloan r-band due to the cloudy weather, 
starting at 15:03:47 UT on 2020-09-06, i.e., 1.88 hr after the BAT trigger.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the XRT position 
(Page et al., GCN 28371), down to a limiting magnitude of r~19.3, 
calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
