Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210318B (trigger #1037335)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 29663).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 264.228, -35.823 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  17h 36m 54.7s 
  Dec(J2000) = -35d 49' 21.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 95%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peak structure running from ~T-4 sec
to T+15 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 14.95 +- 0.50 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.22 to T+19.42 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.10 +- 0.13, 
and Epeak of 252.1 +- 191.6 keV (chi squared 41.33 for 0 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.02 x 10^-5 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+2.70 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
14.5 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.31 +- 0.03 (chi squared 48.69 for 0 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
