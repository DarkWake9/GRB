Christina Thoene, Chloe Feron, Jens Hjorth and Brian L. Jensen (Dark
Cosmology Centre) report

We obtained R and I band observations of GRB 060313 (GCN 4867) with the
Danish 1.5m telescope and DFOSC at La Silla. Observations started at UT
00:23:53 (11min after the burst) until UT 02:11:10. Inside the XRT error
circle (GCN 4870) we detect a new, previously uncatalogued source at the
position (J2000)

RA = : 04:26:28.42
Dec =-10:50:39.84

This is consistent with the position reported in GCN 4871 and GCN 4872.

The R magnitude obtained from stacked images with a mean time of about 1h
after the burst is

R = 20.4 (based on preliminary photometric zero points)
