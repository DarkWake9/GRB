on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

Konus-Wind (KW) was observing the whole sky at the times of the LIGO
events G268556, G270580, and G274296 (hereafter T0; LIGO/VIRGO 
Collaboration GCN Circ. 20364, 20486, and 20689, respectively).
A waiting mode data gap (~100 s in duration) occurred at the time of the 
LIGO event G275404 (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration GCN Circ. 20738), so it was 
excluded from the analysis.

We found no significant (> 5 sigma) detection on temporal scales from 
2.944 s to 100 s using waiting mode data from both KW detectors S1 and 
S2 within +/- 100 s from each of the LIGO triggers.

The table below contains, for each of the triggers, estimates for  upper 
limits (90% conf.) on the fluence (S) for a burst lasting less than 
2.944 s and having a typical KW short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut 
off power law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=500 keV); and on the peak flux 
(Fpeak; on the 2.944 s scale) for a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band 
function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), both in the 10 keV - 
10 MeV band.
