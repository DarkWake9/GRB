At 5h 10m  after  INTEGRAL alert 1991   MASTER robotic telescope
(http://observ.pereplet.ru) had imaging  the corresponding area of the
sky under the large zenit distance, Moon and bad weather conditions.
The first image was started at 19h38m UT.

Now we have 25 unfiltered images of the error box (45s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin, 200 mm camera).

There is no optical transient up to 16 m inside INTEGRAL error box.


Sum FITS image  are available at
