report:

We monitored the field of the BeppoSAX fast X-ray transient 1SAX J0835.9+5118
(Piro GCN 333, Gandolfi et al., IAUC 7174) on the night of UT 990521
with the USNO 1.0-m telescope.  The night was photometric during the
observations, though cirrus arrived shortly thereafter.  Enough
standards were observed to calibrate the field in BVRI.  The calibration
file can be found on
  ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/j0835.dat
where 19 Landolt standards were used for the photometric calibration, and
USNO-A2.0 was used for the astrometric calibration.  Stars brighter than
V=13.5 are saturated and are included only as field identifiers.

A report on our deeper imagery will be posted later.
