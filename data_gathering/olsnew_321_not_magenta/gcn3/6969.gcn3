TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 071010B: Fading quickly

  M. Im, I. Lee (Seoul National University), and Y. Urata
  (Saitama University) on behalf of the EAFON team:

   Using the Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) 1.0m telescope
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute,
  we continued our observation of GRB071010B (GCN 6871,
  Markwardt et al.), beginning at 11:00:20 UT on Oct 21.
  (10.59 days after the burst).
   Now, the optical afterglow (GCN 6873, Oksanen et al.) is very faint,
  and we have only a very marginal detection in our data.
   The faintness of the afterglow further confirms the light curve break
  (GCN6935, Kann et al.; GCN6957, Im, Lee, and Urata, et al.),
  and the GRB is quickly fading.

   Photometry of the object is given below.
