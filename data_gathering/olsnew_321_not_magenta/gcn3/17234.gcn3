report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 141225A (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 17229) with
OSIRIS at the 10.4m GTC. Observations began at 00:25:25 UT (~1.4 hours
post burst). Four 600s spectra were taken with the R1000B grism going from
3750 to 7800 AA. A first analisys based on archival arc lamps reveals
absorption features of FeII and MgII at a preliminary redshift of z=0.915.
