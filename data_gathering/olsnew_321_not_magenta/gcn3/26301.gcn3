The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:22:27 UT on 29 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191129A (trigger 596690552.12649 / 191129141).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 8.9, Dec = 5.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 35m, 5d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110.0 degrees.
