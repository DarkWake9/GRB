a larger collaboration:

We began to observe the field of GRB 130122A (Lien et.al. GCN 14140)
using the Xinglong 2.16m telescope located in Heibei Province, China
at 18:14:12 UT on 2013-01-23. We obtained 5x300s R-band images in a
poor seeing, with a median time of 19.7 hr after the BAT trigger.

The afterglow is not detected in the stacked image, down to a 3sigma
limit of R~20.2 mag, calibrated with nearby USNO B1 stars.
