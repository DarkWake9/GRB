Studio Radiazioni Extraterrestri, Bologna, report: "GRB 000528, which was 
detected by the BeppoSAX Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on May 28.366 UT (GCN Circ.
675), was simultaneously detected with Wide Field Camera (WFC) unit 2.  While
the burst lasted for about 80 s in gamma-rays (40-700 keV), it lasted about
120 s in x-rays (2-26 keV). The WFC-determined position is R.A. = 10h45m06.3s,
Decl. = -33o58'59" (equinox 2000.0), with an error radius of 2' (99-percent
confidence level). The 2-26 keV peak flux is 1.9 Crab units."
