GRB 160102A, localized by MAXI/GSC (Itoh et al., GCN 18801),
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse
started at ~T0(MAXI)-3.6 s with a total duration of ~6 s or less. Due to 
the coarse resolution of the waiting mode light curve we cannot 
unambiguously classify this GRB as a short.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
8.66(-1.23,+3.01)x10^-7 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(MAXI)-0.668 s, of 1.49(-0.62,+0.78)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from ~T0(MAXI)-3.6 s 
to ~T0(MAXI)+2.28 s) by a simple power-law model yields a power law 
index of -2.05(-0.15,+0.23), chi2=0.5/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
