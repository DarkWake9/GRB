V.Chaplin (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:58:11.70 UT on 16 Feb 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130216B (trigger 382733894 / 130216790),
which was also located in Swift/BAT ground analysis (Cummings 2013, GCN 14226).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 93 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 15 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.5 s to T0+6.8 s is fit by
a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.7 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 119 +/- 16 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 15.5 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 91 +/- 21 keV, alpha = -1.6 +/- 0.1 and beta = -2.2 +/- 0.2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
