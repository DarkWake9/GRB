A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU), R.A.M.J. Wijers and A.P. Kamble
(University of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 090102 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at January 8 18.88 UT to January 9
6.86 UT, i.e. 6.66 - 7.16 days after the burst (GCN 8762).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 8766). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around that position is
72 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
position of the optical counterpart is 12 +/- 24 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
