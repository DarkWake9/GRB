The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:11:06 UT on 22 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191022B (trigger 593424671.253214 / 191022341).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 169.3, Dec = -31.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 17m, -31d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 73.0 degrees.
