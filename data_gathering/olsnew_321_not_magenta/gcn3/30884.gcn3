FROM:    Alexander Kann at IAA-CSIC  <kann@iaa.es>

D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC), A. Rossi (INAF-OAS), A. de Ugarte Postigo 
(HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), C. Thoene, M. Blazek, J. F. Agui Fernandez 
(all HETH/IAA-CSIC), and F. Aceituno (IAA) report:

We obtained observations of the enhance XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 
30850) of the Swift short GRB 210919A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN #30846) 
with the 1.5m telescope of OSN, Granada, Spain. We obtained 35 x 120 s 
images in the Rc band, starting at 03:28:22 UT on September 19, under 
good observing conditions. We obtained a second epoch, with 41 x 120 s 
images, the following night, starting at 2:59:51 UT on September 20.

The source detected by Kann et al. (GCN #30883) is very faintly detected 
in the first epoch.

Using the same comparison stars from the PanSTARRS catalog as used by 
Kann et al. (GCN #30883) (transformed to Rc via the Lupton equations, 
then transformed back to AB magnitudes), we measure:

Rc = 24.47 +/- 0.53 mag @ 0.14944 d after trigger (AB mag).

The source is undetected in the second epoch, but it is shallower, with 
Rc > 23.6 mag (AB) @ 1.13649 d after the GRB. We note this detection is 
also fainter than the upper limits listed in Kann et al. (GCN #30883).
