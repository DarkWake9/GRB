The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161202A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 20227) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Although the data from the first epoch were lost due to 
technical problems, our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Dec 03.93 and Dec 
05.77 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Evans et 
al., GCN 20228), with 3sigma upper limits of 200 uJy and 121 uJy 
respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
