The SGR-like burst detected on July 27 at about 06:41 UT with Konus/Wind, 
INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, RHESSI and Suzaku-WAM (Golenetskii et al. GCN 6684), and 
likely associated to SGR 1806-20, has been seen also by the 
Anticoincidence system of AGILE.

This segmented anticoincidence detector surrounds the gamma-ray tracker 
on five sides (top and 4 lateral). The relative intensity of the count 
rates measured from the different sides allows to estimate the arrival 
direction of the detected bursts.

Based on a simple geometrical model, the detection of this event in two of 
the lateral panels and its non-detection in the top panel, yields an 
instrumental azimuthal angle within 3 degrees from that of SGR 1806-20.
 
We thus support the association of this event with SGR 1806-20.
