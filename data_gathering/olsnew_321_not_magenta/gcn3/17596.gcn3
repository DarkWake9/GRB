Using the data set from T-236 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150317A (trigger #635148)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 17592).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 138.995, 55.477 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  09h 15m 58.8s
    Dec(J2000) = +55d 28' 38.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows three separate peaks, each of duration ~5 
seconds, with maxima at T+0, T+12 and T+23 seconds. T90 (15-350 keV) is 23.29 +- 
0.85 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.44 to T+24.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.52 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.5 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.15 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
