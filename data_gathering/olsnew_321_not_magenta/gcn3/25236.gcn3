This GCN is a correction of GCN #25235, presenting ZTF photometry of Pan-STARRS and DECam-GROWTH candidates (GCN #25224, GCN #25215). 

In GCN #25235, the following candidates were included in the table of transients with no ZTF detection before S190718q (GCN #25187).  Instead, they should have been included in the table of candidates with ZTF pre-detections.  

+----------------------------------------------------+
| Name     | TNS name  | Date (UT)        | ZTF phot |
+----------------------------------------------------+
|PS19dxm   | AT2019lzu | 2019-07-14 11:05 | r = 21.5 |
+----------------------------------------------------+
|DG19zrjmb | AT2019lvx | 2019-07-06 07:31 | r = 21.5 |
+----------------------------------------------------+

Hence we exclude the association of PS19dxm / AT2019lzu and DG19zrjmb / AT2019lvx  with S190728q.

Apologies for any confusion that this could have caused.
