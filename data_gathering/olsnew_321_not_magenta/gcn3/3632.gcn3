We imaged the Swift/XRT error circle of GRB 050716 (GCN 3623/3624)
with UKIRT/UFTI starting about 56 minutes post-burst.

Just outside the XRT error circle we find a fading point source
at position (astrometry relative to nearby 2MASS star):

   22 34 20.73   +38 41 03.6  (J2000)

Provisional photometry indicates that this source declines from K~17.8
to K~18.3 between two integrations separated by about 30 mins, making it
very likely to be the afterglow of GRB 050716.

Interestingly, it also appears to be red with J-K~2.5.  A reanalysis
of the very early FT-N data (GCN 3625), however, shows excess flux in
R and I at the source position which, although not a clear detection
(due to the faintness and proximity of nearby USNO star), suggests
that the source is probably reddened rather than at very high
redshift.
