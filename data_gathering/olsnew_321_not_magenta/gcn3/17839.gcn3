We observed the XRT position of GRB 150518A discovered by MAXI
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN  17827, Kawamuro et al., GCN 17825) at 15 GHz
with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on
2015 May 20.962 to 21.128 UT, corresponding to 2.1 days post-burst
(Golenetskii et al., GCN 17837). On this date we detected a radio source
coincident with the position of the optical counterpart (Xu et al., GCN 17829)
with a preliminary flux of 0.19 +/- 0.04 mJy. There are no catalogued radio
sources at this position.

An earlier observation was conducted on 2015 May 19.975 to 20.142 UT,
corresponding to 1.1 days post-burst, yielding a 3 sigma flux upper limit
of 0.13 mJy.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
