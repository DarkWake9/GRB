We observed the Swift GRB 131030A field ( (Troja et al., GCN#15402) using
1.3m DFOT telescope at Devasthal, operated by ARIES Nainital, India. The
observations were started at 16:25:47 UT on 2013-10-31. Two frames in
each R_c and I_c bands with an exposure time of 300s each were obtained
in good seeing conditions.

In our individual frames, we clearly detect the optical counterpart of
GRB 131030A (GNC circular 15403, 15405, 14506, 15410). The
preliminary photometry of co-added R_c (300sec x 2) and
I_c (300sec x 2) frames yields following.
