TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB020911 (2 large error boxes)

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 64815 s.  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration of ~5 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of
3x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 8.7x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s^-1.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=350.222,
-39.646 degrees, whose radius is 38.504 +/- 0.087 degrees (3 sigma).
In addition, a preliminary analysis of the Konus ecliptic latitude
response indicates that this burst originated from a region
whose ecliptic latitude was between 0 and -20 degrees.  This
defines two possible sections of the annulus.  One is between
RA, Decl=313.7, -17.4 and 299.1, -41.1 degrees, and the other
is between RA, Decl=356.6, -1.5 and 21.3, -12.6 degrees.

As Mars Odyssey did not observe this event, a small error box
cannot be derived for it.  However, improvements to the annulus
and ecliptic latitude determination are possible.
