larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 180102A (Page  et al., GCN 22292)   with 
Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory starting 
on Jan. 02 (UT) 21:34:54. We took several images in R-filter.  We do not 
detect any new sources within enhanced XRT error circle (Beardmore et 
al., GCN 22294).  Preliminary photometry of the field is following.
