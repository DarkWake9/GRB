The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:23:49 UT on 15 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210815A (trigger 650687034.634966 / 210815100).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 351.8, Dec = -30.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 27m, -30d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 98.0 degrees.
