T. Sakamoto (GSFC/ORAU) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

There is an error in the 1-s peak photon flux reported in 
Sakamoto et al. (GCN Circular 5206).  Due to hard and weak 
nature of the burst, only the 90% upper limit of 0.5 ph/cm2/s 
is possible to constrain from a power-law fit.  

We apologize for this mistake.  We thank Kazutaka Yamaoka for 
pointing it out.
