Christina C. Thoene (DARK, UC Berkeley), Joshua S. Bloom, Nathaniel R.
Butler (UCB) and Peter Nugent (LBL) report:

We obtained spectra of several sources around the reported XRT positions
of GRB70810B (GCN 6754 , Starling et al.) on Aug. 11, 12:30 UT, using Keck
I + LRIS. No new source is seen in imaging of the field at the same time.
At the position of source 1 ("S1") from Starling et al., there is no
optical counterpart visible. From further analysis of the X-ray data, we
detect another weak X-ray source at RA 00:35:46.892, DEC 08:51:05.96
("S3") which includes a weak optical source.
Within the BAT error circle, there is an early type galaxy (LEDA 1354367)
as noted first in Marshall et. al, GCN 6743, for which we determined a
redshift of z=0.0385 derived from Ca H&K absorption lines.
Around source 2 ("S2"), there are four galaxies of which two show strong
emission lines leading to a redshifts around z=0.49 from OII, OIII and the
Balmer series. The two other galaxies have marginal detections of emission
lines at the same redshift and these galaxies might therefore be part of a
cluster or even interacting.

CT wants to thank Keck support astronomer Greg Wirth and his wife for
excellent dinner support during the observations. Tusend tak!
