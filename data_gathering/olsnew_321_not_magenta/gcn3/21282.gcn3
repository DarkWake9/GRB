The long-duration GRB 170626B (Liu et al., GCN Circ. 21265; Konus-Wind
trigger time on 00:58:02.21 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (CGBM) at 00:57:56.28 on 26 June 2017.  The burst signal was
seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two overlapping peaks.  The emission
starts at T+1 sec, peaks at T+2.5 sec (the first peak) and T+5.5 sec
(the second peak), and ends at T+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 5.0 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
