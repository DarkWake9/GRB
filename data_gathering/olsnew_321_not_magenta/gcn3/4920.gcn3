M. Jelínek, S. Guziy (IAA-CSIC, Granada), J. M. González-Pérez
(IAC, La Laguna)  and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), on behalf
of a larger collaboration,

report:

Following the detection of the long GRB 060322 by SWIFT (Perri
et al. GCNC 4903), we have observed the field with the 0.8m
IAC80 telescope at Observatorio del Teide in Canary Islands.
Images were taken in the R- and I-bands starting on 23.265 UT
(i.e. 7.3 hr after the event), under not optimal observing
conditions (high airmass and 9 degrees away from the last quarter
moon). We do not detect any object within the 5" radius error
box of the possible X-ray afterglow (Perri et al. GCNC 4919).
The 5-sigma limiting magnitude for the co-added R-band frame
(3 x 300s) is 19.3 .
