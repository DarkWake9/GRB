We observed the field of GRB 161004A (Evans, et al., GCN 19979) with 
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) 
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico 
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/10 5.10 to 2016/10 5.22 
UTC (13.49 to 16.23 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total 
of 1.73 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.65 hours exposure in 
the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-UVOT error circle (Breeveld & Evans, 
GCN 19984), in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we 
obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 23.3
  i > 23.2
  Z > 22.4
  Y > 21.8
  J > 21.3
  H > 19.4

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
