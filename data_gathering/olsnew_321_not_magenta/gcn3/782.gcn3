 Gordon Garmire (Penn State Universtiy), Luigi Piro (IAS/CNR), Giulia
 Stratta (IAS/CNR), Michael Garcia(Chandra X-ray Center), and Joy Nichols
 (Chandra X-ray Center) report:
 
 Following the reprocessing of the Chandra observation of GRB000210 by the
 Chandra X-ray Center (CXC), the best position of the GRB is 
 
 RA=01h 59m 15.6s  DEC= -40d 39' 32.5"
 
 (equinox 2000)

 Using 5 stars detected in X-rays and comparing their positions to the USNO
 A2 and 2MASS catalog positions, the GRB position is derived to be
 
 RA= 01h 59m 15.7s  DEC= -40d 39' 32.3"

 with an estimated error of 1.6"

The two measurements are consistent within the error and  also
in agreement with the optical candidate proposed by Gorosabel et al (GCN
n. 545)
