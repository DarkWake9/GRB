report on behalf of the iPTF and GROWTH collaborations

We observed the transient MASTER OT J173532.70+103810.5 reported in LVC GCN
#20740, using ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope, on 2017-02-26 at
05:40 UT.

We do not detect any transient at the reported coordinates, in agreement
with observations from the Liverpool Telescope (LVC GCN # 20750). The
3-sigma limiting (unfiltered) magnitude of our stacked acquisition frames
at the expected position of the transient is  ~21.1 mag.

This would imply an extremely fast rate of fading > approx. 10 mag / day!
We caution that there is a variable star (PTF1717w) which is within a few
arcsec of the reported MASTER OT position. But this nearby variable star
only shows variations between roughly 19.0-19.6 mag in R-band in archival
PTF data. Additional follow-up is encouraged.
