​S. Schulze (Weizmann Institute) & Z. Cano (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

Using the 8.2-m Gemini-South telescope mounted with GMOS-S we initiated
follow-up spectral classifications of the brightest transients identified
by the Transient Name Server (TNS; https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il) within
the LIGO/Virgo G270580 error region.  Originally hindered by bad weather,
we successfully observed two transients on 2017-01-28 (PS17rz) and
2017-01-31 (AT2017ux).  Both spectroscopic classifications were performed
using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).


Survey Name | IAU Name   | RA (J2000)   | Dec (J2000)  |      Date
| Time (UT) | Grism     | Exposure | Type  | Phase      | Redshift  | Note
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PS17rz           |     -              | 09:36:57.18 | 29:40:06.10  |
2017-01-28 | 06:37:56   | R400      | 3 x 600s  | SN Ia  | pre-max |
0.151(4)  | (1)
AT2017ux      | SN2017ux   | 09:22:53.20 | -03:12:52.30 |    2017-01-31 |
07:07:14   | R400      | 2 x 600s  | SN Ia  | max        | 0.065(6)  | (2,3)


Notes:
(1) The best-fitting templates were all SNe Ia at an average phase of -4
days before peak light.
(2) The best-fitting templates were all SNe Ia at an average phase of -1
day before peak light.
(3) Our measured SN classification (Ia) and redshift matches well with that
already reported to the TNS (z=0.07).
