We observed the field of GRB 151027B (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 18499) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/10 31.23 to 2015/10 31.52 UTC (78.85 to 85.85 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.20 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We no longer detect the optical afterglow (Malesani et al., GCN 18501).  In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

   r > 23.45
   i > 23.39
   z > 18.57

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
