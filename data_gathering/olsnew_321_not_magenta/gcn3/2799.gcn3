Report on behalf of the Follow-Up-Network (FUN) GRB collaboration:

We observed a 6x6 arcminute field centered on the optical afterglow (GCN

2765, 2766) of GRB 041006 (=H3570) discovered by HETE (GCN 2770)
with the SARA 0.9 m Telescope at KPNO. Observations were carried out
under good seeing conditions with the AP7 CCD. We obtained 25 minutes
of exposure each in B and R, and 70 minutes in V. Observations started
at UT Oct. 7.6216, and ended Oct 7.7065. We do not detect the afterglow
in either the B-band or the R-band, but do detect it in V. Our B-band
limit is
estimated as B > 19.8, based on field star photometry described in GCN
2789.
The estimated R-band limit is R > 19.5, based on photometry described in

GCN 2782. The detection in the V-band yields a preliminary magnitude,
based
on photometry described in GCN 2789, of V = 20.9 +/- 0.2 (statistical
error).

This message may be cited, but we caution that the final photometry
remains to
be carried out with a larger set of calibration stars.
