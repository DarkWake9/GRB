B. A. Zauderer, W. Fong, E. Berger and T. Laskar (Harvard) report
on behalf of the CARMA Key Project, "A Millimeter View of the
Transient Universe" and a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of GRB 130609A (Cummings et al. GCN 14828;
also detected by Fitzpatrick et al. GCN 14839) beginning 2013 Jun 9.88 UT
(dt = 0.75 d) with the Very Large Array (VLA) and beginning  2013 Jun 10.05
UT (dt = 0.92 d) with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy
(CARMA).  For this dark burst with deep optical and NIR afterglow upper limits
(e.g. Perley et al. GCN 14830 and Butler et al. GCN 14831), we find no
significant radio emission at the enhanced Swift-XRT position (Evans et al.;
GCN 14835) with the following three-sigma upper limits:
 5.8  GHz  <35 uJy  (VLA)
21.8  GHz  <60 uJy  (VLA)
84.5  GHz   <0.36 mJy (CARMA).

We thank the VLA and CARMA staff and observers for their support of these
observations."
