SUBJECT: GRB 210824A: Swift detection of a burst

K. L. Page (U Leicester), N. J. Klingler (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII),
H. A. Krimm (NSF), A. Y. Lien (U Tampa), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 04:10:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210824A (trigger=1070157).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 232.132, +11.135 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 28m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = +11d 08' 07"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:15:08.4 UT, 306.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 232.10513, 11.15208 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 15h 28m 25.23s
   Dec(J2000) = +11d 09' 07.5"
with an uncertainty of 7.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 113 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (3.31 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 8.5
(+5.30/-4.44) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 310 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically
complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.036.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
