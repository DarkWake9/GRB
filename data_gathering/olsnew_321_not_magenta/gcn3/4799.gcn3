A.L. Homewood, K.V. Garimella, C.A. Riddle, M.R. Troutman, A.M. Manning,
S.P. Fuller, T. McIntrye, and D.H. Hartmann report on behalf of the
Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We have imaged the field of GRB060219 (GCN 4788) beginning approximately
12 hours after the trigger notice with the SARA 0.9-m at Kitt Peak, under
decent weather conditions. Visual analysis of co-added frame with DSS
yields no new sources down to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 19.0 mag when
compared to USNO A2.0.
