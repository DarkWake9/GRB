In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger event S190408an at T0 = 2019-04-08 18:18:02 (UT)
(GCN #24069) we performed a further analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector
(GRID) data after the trigger time.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 30 MeV - 10 GeV was performed over the time
interval T0+200s -- T0+300s, where full coverage of the majority of the localisation
region (>95%) was reached.

Preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the accessible
LIGO/Virgo 90% c.l. localization region over this time interval are in the range:

from 2.5e-07 to 3.5e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for an integration time of 100s.

These UL values are compatible with those obtained for an integration time of 100s
before T0, and reported in the previous AGILE GRID GCN #24071.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the sky
in spinning mode.
