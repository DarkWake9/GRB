GRB 981220: Optical Observations

A. C. Eichelberger, J. S. Bloom, S. R. Kulkarni, R. R. Gal (Caltech),
E. G. Martin (UCB), and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report:

On December 23, 1998 (UT) we obtained four 300-s R-band imaging of the
field of GRB 981220 with LRIS on the Keck II 10-m telescope. Based on
astrometry from the USNO-A2 catalogue, at the position of the transient
radio source (RT; GCN #170) we find a faint source in the stacked
image. Our astrometry is good to 0.3 arcsec (rms) in each coordinate.
Lacking observations of standard stars, we have used the standard
R-band zeropoint of LRIS.  Using a 1.2 arcsec aperture we find the
object at the position of the RT to have R= 26.7 +/- 0.7 mag on 23.4
Dec 1998 UT. For reference, this zeropoint implies that the USNO star
at ra: 03:42:28.32, dec:  +17:09:42.60 (J2000) has a magnitude of
R=18.35.

Although the object appears somewhat extended in our 0.8 arcsec (FWHM)
seeing, deeper imaging is required to firmly establish that this object
is indeed the host galaxy of the GRB.

This message is citeable.
