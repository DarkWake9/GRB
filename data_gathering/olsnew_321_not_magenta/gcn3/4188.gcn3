At 06:26:41 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 051105 (trigger=162580).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA,Dec 265.289d,+34.921d {17h 41m 09s,+34d 55' 15"} (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows a single spike with a total duration
of less than 128 msec.  The peak count rate was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at 0.0 seconds after the trigger.

XRT began observing at 06:27:49.09 UT, 67.6 sec after BAT Trigger time.
The on-board detection algorithm failed to find a centroid due to low source
counts.  The XRT light curve shows no X-ray emission in the field.  Further
analysis will require processing of the XRT full telemetry data following
the next ground station contact.

The UVOT began observing at 06:27:48 UT, 66.5 sec after the BAT trigger.  
Due to a delay in receipt of the initial data files, no results are
currently available.  The V-band extinction in the direction of the
BAT GRB position is A_V = 0.11.
