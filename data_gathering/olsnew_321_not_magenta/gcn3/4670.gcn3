TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4670
SUBJECT: GRB 060204B: ART early limit
DATE:    06/02/05 04:09:16 GMT
FROM:    Ken ichi Torii at RIKEN  <torii@ess.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp>

K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 In addition to that reported in GCN 4660, we made further analysis of the 
early ART 3b data for GRB 060204B (Falcone et al. GCN 4655).

 The position of the optical afterglow (Guidorzi et al. GCN 4661; Moon
& Cenko GCN 4667) was imaged very close to the edge of the ART 3b
field of view, starting at 14:36:45 (141 s after the BAT
trigger). From the preliminary analysis of a stacked frame (60s x 10
in Ic), we derive the following limit for the afterglow.
