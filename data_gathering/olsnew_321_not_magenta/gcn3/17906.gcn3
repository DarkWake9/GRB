O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:55:09.85 UT on the 7th of June 2015, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150607A
(trigger 455356512 / 150607330), which was also detected
by Swift (D'Elia  et al. 2015, GCN 17904). The GBM
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight using this position
is about 130 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows several bright pulses over a
duration (T90) of 31.8 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-1.7 s to T0+30.1 s is well fit by power
law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The
power law index is -0.98 +/- 0.17 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 137 +/- 22 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.4 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+6.8 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 6.8 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
