We observed the field of GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 23688)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2019/01 17.09 to
2019/01 17.29 UTC (53.26 to 58.02 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 0.88 hours of exposure in the g and r bands, 1.76
hours exposure i band, and 1.01 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We detect a source coincident with the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et
al., GCN Circ. 23704) and possible host galaxy (de Ugarte Postigo et
al., GCN Circ. 23692) with the following magnitudes:

  r	= 20.24 +/- 0.10
  i	= 19.65 +/- 0.06
  Z	= 19.48 +/- 0.05
  Y	= 19.22 +/- 0.03
  J	= 18.60 +/- 0.04
  H	= 18.23 +/- 0.06

These magnitudes are in the AB system, in comparison with the USNO-B1
and 2MASS catalogs, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the
direction of the GRB.

The source is still considerably brighter in riz than the Pan-STARRs
photometry reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN Circ. 23692).
Further observations are planned.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
