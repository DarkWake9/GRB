R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

We have searched the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data
for a gamma-ray counterpart to IceCube-190221A (The
IceCube Collaboration, GCN 23918). The neutrino position
(RA, Dec) = (268.81, -17.04) was Earth-occulted for
Fermi-GBM from about T0-700 s to T0+1200 s. We therefore
cannot set any limits on impulsive emission.
