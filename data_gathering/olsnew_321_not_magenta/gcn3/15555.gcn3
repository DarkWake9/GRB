We again observed the field of GRB 131127A (Markwardt, et al., GCN 15516)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/11 29.09 to 2013/11 29.17 UTC
(40.06 to 41.98 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.42
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.60 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

For the red source 3.3" away from the center of the XRT positions (Butler
et al., GCN 15525), in comparison with 2MASS, we obtain:

r > 23.78
i = 22.68 +/- 0.16 (0.20 +/- 0.19)
Z = 22.02 +/- 0.26 (0.17 +/- 0.31)
Y = 21.31 +/- 0.24 (0.09 +/- 0.28)
J = 21.26 +/- 0.29 (0.23 +/- 0.32)
H = 20.55 +/- 0.24 (-0.33 +/- 0.31)

The change in magnitude relative to the observations on the previous night
are given in the parentheses.  There is slight (~<1-sigma) evidence for a
fade in most bands, but the shallowness ~t^(-0.2) of the fade is not
expected for a GRB afterglow.  We conclude, as did Im et al. (GCN 15548),
that this source is not the afterglow of GRB 131127A.

Mártir.
