report on behalf of the larger ARI-LJMU collaboration

In further analysis of the LT spectrum reported in GCN 18370 of PS15ccx
we have now succeeded in obtaining a classification of the spectrum
using SNID by truncating the wavelength range to between 4500 and
7500 Angstroms to remove the regions of poorest signal to noise ratio.

SNID reports a 96% probability that the transient is a Supernova Type Ia
at age 15-23 days post maximum with z~0.097.
