The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:49:46 UT on 19 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211219B (trigger 661643391.008452 / 211219910).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 68.5, Dec = -63.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 33m, -63d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 151.0 degrees.
