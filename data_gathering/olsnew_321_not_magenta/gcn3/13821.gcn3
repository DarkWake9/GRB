A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and S.R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Further XRT follow-up observations covering the field of the GBM and
IPN-detected burst GRB 120919A (Rau et al. GCN Circ. 13785, Hurley et
al.  GCN Circ.  13786) have been performed. The data total 15 ks in
Photon Counting (PC) mode, collected in three observations from 134 ks
to 573 ks after the trigger. The two X-ray sources identified within
the IPN error box after the inital XRT observation (Beardmore and
Oates, GCN C. 13790) show no evidence for fading. Likewise, none of
the additional sources seen in the XRT field, but outside the IPN
error box, show evidence for fading, implying we have not detected any
X-ray counterpart to this GRB. The 3 sigma detection limit is
approximately 2.5e-3 count/s (per 5ks observation), which corresponds
to a 0.3-10 keV flux limit of 1.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (for a typical
GRB spectrum).
