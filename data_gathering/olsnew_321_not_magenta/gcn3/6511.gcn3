M. C. Stroh (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:21:17 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070612B (trigger=282073). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 261.713, -8.719 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 26m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 43' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showes a single peak
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data 
products to analyze.  XRT and UVOT will begin observing this target
at 07:13 UT.
