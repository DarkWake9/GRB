J. A. Kennea (PSU) and G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT 
team:

At 23:36 UT, September 2nd, 2009, Swift began a Target of Opportunity 
observation of the Fermi GBM/LAT discovered burst GRB 090902B (de Palma et 
al., GCN #9867, Bissaldi et al., GCN #9866), approximately 12.5 hours 
after the Fermi detection. In early data we detect an uncatalogued point 
source at the following location, RA, Dec = 264.93984, 27.32405, which is 
equivalent to:

RA (J2000) = 17h 39m 45.6s
Dec (J2000) = +27d 19' 26.6''

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.2 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). 
This position is 3.2 arcmin from the reported LAT position, inside the LAT 
error radius.

At this time we cannot confirm if the point source is fading. Observations 
of this field are on-going.
