On 2019/10/04 at UT 22:39:21 we obtained a 1800 sec exposure SALT spectrum of the blue transient source, Swift J221951-484240, discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in the field of the gravitational wave event S190930t (GCN 25901, 25939). We used the Robert Stobie spectrograph with the PG 300 grating and a 1.5 arsec  slit, covering 3300-9800 Angstroms with a resolving power of 370.  The spectrum is characterized by a steeply rising blue continuum, consistent with the earlier report (GCN 25939). The spectrum is essentially featureless, except for a possible weak double-peaked emission line at 4250A, although its reality needs further confirmation.  Thus there is still no indication as to whether this transient is  Galactic or it is instead a hostless extragalactic object.
