S. de Wet (UCT) and D.B. Malesani (Radboud and DAWN/NBI) report:

Following the detection of GRB 220826A by Swift and its X-ray and optical
counterparts (Caputo et al., GCN 32484; Kuin et al., GCN 32488; Romanov
F.P., GCN 32487), the 1m Lesedi optical telescope located at Sutherland,
South Africa, obtained 600 s exposures in each of the g,r,i and z bands
with the Mookodi low-resolution spectrograph and imager beginning at
17:27:09 UT, approximately 0.23 days post-trigger.

We detect the optical afterglow to GRB 220826A in each image at the UVOT
position with the following AB magnitude, calibrated to Skymapper flux
measurements of a nearby star in the field:

r = 21.48 +/- 0.16

Lesedi is built and operated by the South African Astronomical Observatory.
