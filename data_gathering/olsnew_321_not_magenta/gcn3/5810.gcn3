Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061110B (trigger #238174)
(Fox, et al., GCN Circ. 5800).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 323.916, 6.870 deg {21h 35m 39.8s, 6d 52' 12.2"} (J2000)
+- 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding
was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve has several peaks starting at ~T-18 sec 
out to ~T+38 sec.  There is ongoing low-level emission out to at least
T+172 sec at which time the spacecraft slewed to a planned target and
the burst location slewed out of the BAT FOV.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
is at least 128 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-16.5 to T+127.9 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.03 +- 0.16.  The lower limit to the fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+3.26 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

The GCN Notices for this burst were delayed (~10 min) because this trigger
occurred during a Malindi downlink pass, during which the TDRSS data stream
is buffered on-board the spacecraft.
