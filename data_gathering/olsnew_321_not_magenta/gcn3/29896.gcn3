The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:40:11 UT on 24 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210424A (trigger 640982416.446996 / 210424778).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 9.0, Dec = 13.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 36m, 13d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
