report:

We observed the field of GRB 161011A (D'Elia, et al., GCN 20023) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/10 13.11 to 2016/10 13.15 UTC (44.66
to 45.69 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.69 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.27 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

We do not detect the optical source reported by Mazaeva, et al. (GCN 20030).
For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne, et al., GCN 20026),
in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 23.4
  i > 22.7
  Z > 21.7
  Y > 21.4
  J > 21.0
  H > 20.7

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
