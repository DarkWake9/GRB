The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:32:49 UT on 8 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220508A (trigger 673741974.516028 / 220508939).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.4, Dec = -3.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 57m, -3d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
