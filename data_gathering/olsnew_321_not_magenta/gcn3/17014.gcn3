We imaged the field of GRB 141031B detected by SWIFT(trigger 617149)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy (member of ISSP:Italian Supernovae Search Project)

The observations started 2.16 hour after the GRB trigger, at the end of twilight, 
with our schmidt telescope D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We did not found any optical counterpart
in the error box of the XRTcandidate.
