the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190930s at T0 = 2019-09-30 
13:35:41 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter 
(MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval 
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, the 100% of the S190930s 90 c.l. localization region (LR) was 
accessible to the AGILE MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are 
obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions 
within the accessible S190930s LR, from a minimum of 1.41E-06 erg cm^-2 
to a maximum of 6.51E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single 
power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in 
the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in 
progress.
