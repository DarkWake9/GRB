S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the Swift GRB050215b with the automated
Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Our first epoch consists of 9 x 120 s
exposures in the Kron R band, taken at a mean time of 12:00 February
15 UT (~ 9.5 hours after the burst).  Our second epoch consists of 5 x
120 s exposures in the Kron R band, taken at a mean time of 6:50
February 17 UT (~ 52.3 hours after the burst).  Both epochs reach a
3-sigma limiting magnitude of R ~ 20.5.

The only source present in either epoch in the XRT error circle (Page
et.  al., GCN 3027) is the USNO source discussed by Goad et. al. (GCN
3032).  We find no evidence for any variability in this source (R =
17.23 +/- 0.1 in epoch 1, R = 17.30 +/- 0.1 in epoch 2).

To our limits, we find no optical counterpart to the NIR candidate
proposed by Tanvir et. al. (GCN 3031) in either epoch.
