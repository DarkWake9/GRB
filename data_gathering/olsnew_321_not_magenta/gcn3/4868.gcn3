We imaged the field of the short hard burst GRB 030613 (GCN 4867, 
Pagani et al.) with the robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at 
La Silla, Chile.

The observations were performed both with the optical and the
infrared camera of the REM telescope and started about 33 seconds 
after the GCN alert and about 45 seconds after the burst.

First inspection of visual and infrared images do not reveal any new 
source inside the Swift-BAT error circle (GCN 4867, Pagani et al.) 
down to the limiting magnitude of the 2MASS catalog.

Further observations and analises are still ongoing.
