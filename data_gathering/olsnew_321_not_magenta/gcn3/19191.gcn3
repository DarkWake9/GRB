D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI), T. 
Kruehler (MPE Garching), A. Kvammen (Univ. Tromsoe, Norway, and NOT), 
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 160314A (D'Elia et al., GCN 
19182; Siegel & D'Elia, GCN 19187) with the Nordic Optical Telescope 
(NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC imager. Our observations were carried out 
in the r and i bands, and started on 2016 March 14.86 (9.07 hr after the 
GRB).

An object at a position consistent with the UVOT object is detected in 
both filters. We measure its coordinates to be (J2000; 0.3" uncertainty):

RA =  07:31:09.73
Dec = +16:59:58.7

At a mean epoch of Mar 14.865 UT, we measure for the afterglow r = 22.40 
+- 0.06 (AB), calibrated against nearby SDSS stars. We thus confirm the 
UVOT object as the afterglow of GRB 160314A.

We note that a faint object is marginally detected at the afterglow 
position in the SDSS data, visible after stacking the gri images. This 
could be a relatively bright host galaxy for GRB 160314A. A finding
