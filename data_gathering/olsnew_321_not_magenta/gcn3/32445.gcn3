K. L. Page (U Leicester), J.D. Gropp (PSU), S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC),
D. M. Palmer (LANL), T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 18:08:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220806A (trigger=1119268).  Swift could not slew to the
burst location due to a Moon constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 260.873, -26.023 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 23m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 01' 22"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 18:30 UT on 2022 August 09. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (kimlpage1978 AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
