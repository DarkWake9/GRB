report:

"We have imaged a 7' x 7' region centred on the HETE-2/SXC
error box for GRB 051211 (Atteia et al. GCNC 4324) with the 
0.8-m IAC telescope at the Observatorio del Teide starting 
on Dec 11.279 UT (i.e. 3.9 hours after the GRB). Two frames 
(600s exposure time, R-band) were taken under poor meteo-
rological conditions (strong wind and increasing background
due to the proximity of the twilight). No optical variable 
is detected in a 3' field centred on the HETE-2/SXC error 
box down to limiting magnitude of R about 19."
