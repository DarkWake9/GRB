Chandra target-of-opportunity observations of the HETE SXC error 
circle for XRF030723 (= H2777: Prigozhin et al, GCN 2313) have been 
approved and scheduled. The first epoch observation will commence at 
10h UT on 25 July, with a second epoch observation ~1 week later.

The scheduling of contemporaneous observations at other wavelengths, 
especially deep initial epoch optical and IR observations, is 
strongly encouraged.
