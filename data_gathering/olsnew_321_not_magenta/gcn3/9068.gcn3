Using the data set from T-239 to T+914 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090401B (trigger #348152)
(Schady, et al., GCN Circ. 9066).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 95.095, -8.963 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 20m 22.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 57' 47.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several FRED-like peaks with the first
starting at ~T-0.4 sec.  The brightest peak is at ~T+7 sec with a long
exponential tail out to ~T+600 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 183 +- 39 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+326.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.37 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.0 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.49 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 23.1 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
