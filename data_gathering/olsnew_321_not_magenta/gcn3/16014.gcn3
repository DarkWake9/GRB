G. Younes (USRA/MSFC), V. Connaughton (UAH), C. Meegan (UAH),
and A. von Kienlin (MPE) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:12:46.11 UT on 20 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140320A (trigger 416974369/140320092),
which was also detected by Swift (Cannizzo et al. 2014, GCN 16000).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The angle to the Fermi LAT boresight is 24 deg. using the Swift location.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a
duration (T90) of 1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.32 to T0+0.704 s is
well fit by a simple power law function with index of -1.5 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.0 +/- 0.5) E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.128 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.0 +/- 1.0 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
