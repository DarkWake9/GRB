"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and the Wide Field Camera
(WFC) unit 2 observed the GRB 010220 on February 20.952164 UT (GCN 952).
The event detected by the GRBM shows a single pulse with a time duration
of 40 s and a peak count rate of about 660 cts/s in the 40-700 keV
energy band. In the WFC, the duration is about 150 s and the peak flux is
0.7 Crab (2-26 keV). The centroid position of the X-ray counterpart from
the WFC image is R.A. = 2h36m59s, Dec = 61o46'.0 (equinox 2000.0) with
an error radius of 4' that includes uncertainties due to a non-optimum
attitude control configuration (GCN 953).
A follow-up observation with  BeppoSAX narrow-field instrument is in
progress."
