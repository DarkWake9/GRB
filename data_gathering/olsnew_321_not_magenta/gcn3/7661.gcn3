report:

The optical counterpart (GCN7646) of GRB 080430 (GCN 7647) was observed 
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK 
National Observatory, Turkey), starting at May 01, 21:58 UT, i.e.
~26.08 hours after the burst, using Andor CCD.

A series of frames 3*300s in R and 3*600s in B bands were made.
The afterglow is clearly detected  in all images. Using USNO-B1 star
(416-022819, RA=11:01:16.86, DEC=+51:40:38.5, B2MAG=17.79, R2MAG=16.61)
we estimated the following magnitudes for the OT  on combined images:

t-t0 (h)	band	mag 	err
26.25		R	21.3	0.1
27.98		B	22.3	0.1
