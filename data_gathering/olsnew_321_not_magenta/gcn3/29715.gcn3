The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:25:06 UT on 24 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210324B (trigger 638306711.486032 / 210324809).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 173.5, Dec = 6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 33m, 6d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
