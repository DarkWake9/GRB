The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:05:14.01 UT on 20 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210820B (trigger 651110719 / 210820004).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 277.0, Dec = +67.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 28m, +67d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 31.0 degrees.
