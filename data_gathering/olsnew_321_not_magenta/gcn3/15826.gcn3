M. H. Siegel (PSU) and S. T. Holland (STScI) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3428 seconds after the BAT trigger on GRB 140213A (Holland et al., GCN Circ.
15825). There is a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
 RA(J2000)  =	07:00:37.09 = 105.15455
 DEC(J2000) = -73:08:13.5  = -73.13707
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.62 arc sec. This position is 6.2
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
17.74 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.15.
