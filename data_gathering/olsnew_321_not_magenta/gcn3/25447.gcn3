collaboration:

ENGRAVE targeted 9 fields containing 17 high-probability host galaxies 
for S190814bv, based on the LALInference skymap (LIGO Scientific 
Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 25333), with deep VLT/HAWK-I 
imaging over two epochs in a search for intrinsically faint, near 
infrared transient sources. As part of this search, we observed the host 
galaxy 2MASX J00472894-2526263 of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope 
(CFHT) candidate reported by Ruan et al. (GCN 25443).

The observations were conducted between 06:55 and 07:14 UT on 2019-08-16 
and a second epoch between 04:32 and 04:50 UT on 2019-08-21, 
approximately 1.4 and 6.3 d after S190814bv, respectively (600 s 
exposure per epoch in the Ks filter). The source is detected in both 
epochs with AB magnitudes of 21.0 +- 0.1 and 20.9 +- 0.1, respectively 
(based on preliminary photometry calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).

This field was also covered serendipitously by the ESO/VISTA survey 
telescope in the Ks band during the science verification program. The 
CFHT candidate is detected in images from 2009-10-23 and 2009-10-30. We 
measure a brightness around 0.5 mag fainter in the historic data 
compared to the HAWK-I measurement. This confirms some level of 
long-term variability, consistent with the report by Ruan et al. (GCN 
25443).

The lack of variability between the two VLT/HAWK-I images and especially 
the archival detection suggest that this object is unrelated to S190814bv.

Brillant, J. Corral-Santana, B. Haussler, C. Opitom, F. J. Selman, and

collaboration at the European Southern Observatory under ESO program 
0103.D-0722 (for further information on ENGRAVE see

verification program 60.A-9285(A). We acknowledge valuable help with the 
archival VISTA data by Carlos Gonzalez-Fernandez (CASU / IoA Cambridge).
