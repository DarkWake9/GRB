We have obtained spectroscopic observations of GRB 080430 from the 2.2m
Calar
Alto telescope (+CAFOS) starting at 21:11 UT (78 minutes after the
burst). The
observations consisted of 3x1200s integrations in low resolution. The
signal to noise
ratio is low but after a preliminary reduction we may conclude:

1) Continuum is clearly detected down to 3500 Angstroms, implying a
redshift smaller
than 1.9.
2) We detect an absorption feature at ~4900 Angstroms that we suggest to
be the
MgII doublet (2796.3, 2803.5), implying a most probable redshift of ~0.75.

Further analysis is ongoing. Additional spectroscopic observations are
encouraged.
