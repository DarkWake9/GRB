A. Volnova (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), M. Eselevich (ISTP), I. Korobtsev
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up
collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 131031A (Cummings et al., GCN
15421) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy). We took
several images in R-filter of 60 s exposure on Nov., 01, 02, and 05.
In the stacked images from Nov. 01 and 02 in the XRT error circle
(Gompertz & Page, GCN 15424) we detected a source which is coincident
with the source reported by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 15426).

The details of the photometry are the following:

20131105 15:59:53 5.21974       R        91x60 >22.3 (UL 3 sigma)

The photometry is based 3 SDSS stars, R (gri -> R transformations by
Lupton 2005):
