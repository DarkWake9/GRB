J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst GRB 220511A (DeLaunay et al. GCN Circ.
32023), collecting 5.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+37.4 ks and T0+49.1 ks. The burst was also detected by Fermi-GBM
(GCN Circ. 32018), AGILE (Ursi et al., GCN 32021) and AstroSat CZTI
(Gopalakrishnan et al., GCN 32028). 

Two uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of them
is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading. Therefore,
at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the afterglow.
Details of these sources are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  287.4316  =  19:09:43.59
  Dec (J2000.0): +17.7297  =  +17:43:46.9
  Error: 5.4 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (4.7 +/- 1.2)e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 59 arcsec from Swift/BAT-GUANO position.
  Flux: (1.94 +/- 0.51)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 3:
  RA (J2000.0):  287.5100  =  19:10:2.41
  Dec (J2000.0): +17.7394  =  +17:44:21.8
  Error: 4.0 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: (3.9 [+1.2, -1.0])e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 219 arcsec from Swift/BAT-GUANO position.
  Flux: (7.9 [+2.5, -2.1])e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

A catalogued source was also detected.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
