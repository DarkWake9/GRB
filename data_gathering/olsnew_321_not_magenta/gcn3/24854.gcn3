The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 19/06/19 at 13:14:18.04 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a 
high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was 
selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Gold alert stream.  The average 
astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50%. This alert has an 
estimated false alarm rate of 0.98 events per year due to atmospheric 
backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the 
time of detection.

After the initial automated alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/132707_54984442.amon), more  
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with 
the direction refined to:

Date: 19/06/19
Time: 13:14:18.04 UT
RA: 343.26 (+ 4.08 - 2.63 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 10.73 (+ 1.51 - 2.61 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help 
identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty 
region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL 
J2252.6+1245 at RA: 343.17 deg, Dec: 12.75 deg (2.73 deg away from the 
best-fit event position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
