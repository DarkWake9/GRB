A.Volnova (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP),  I. Korobtsev (ISTP), M. Eselevich
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140320C (Mereghetti  et al., GCN 16007)
with AZT-33IK telescope of Mondy observatory starting on Mar. 20 (UT)
15:12:44 and Mar. 23 (UT) 15:37:46. Several images of 120 s exposure in 
R-filter ere obtained in both epochs.  After receiving all data sets we 
refined our measurements of the optical source N3 reported early as one 
of a possible afterglow candidate (Volnova et al., GCN 16012). Enhanced 
position of the source is (J2000) 08 57 34.40 +71 11 54.7 (uncertainty 
of  0.35" is each coordinate) is within XRT error circle and  apart 1.1" 
of the center of XRT localization (Pagani  et al., GCN 16017). A 
photometry of the source:

Based on our photometry we confirm the source N3 (Volnova et al., GCN 
16012) is the afterglow of GRB 140320C.
