The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:47:14 UT on 13 Feb 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210213A (trigger 634931239.164872 / 210213741).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 122.5, Dec = 22.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 09m, 22d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100.0 degrees.
