and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 180111A (Lien et al., GCN circ. 22318; Verrecchia
et al., GCN circ. 22321) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 16:42:04.15 on 11 January 2018.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM
instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two overlapping peaks.  The emission
starts at T+2.1 sec, peaks at T+2.6 sec and ends at T+43.4 sec.  The T90 and
the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 34.3 +- 6.6 sec and
11.0 +- 2.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
