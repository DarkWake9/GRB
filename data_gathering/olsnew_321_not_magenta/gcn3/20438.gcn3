P. D'Avanzo, D. Fugazza, S. Covino, A. Melandri (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the short GRB 170112A (Mingo et al., GCN 20436) with the 60-cm robotic 
telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 02:02:55 UT, 
55 seconds after the burst, and were carried out simultaneously in the g, r, i, z and H bands.

A preliminary photometry of the first co-added images indicates that no obvious afterglow candidate 
is detected within the Swift/BAT error circle (Mingo et al. GCN 20436) down to the following 3sigma 
limiting magnitudes:

r > 18.8 at T-T0 = 763s
H > 18.0 at T-T0 = 730s


Magnitudes are in the AB system and have been calibrated with respect to the 2MASS (H-band) 
and APASS (r-band) catalogues.
