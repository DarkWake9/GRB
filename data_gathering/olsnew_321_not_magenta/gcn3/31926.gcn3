Further analysis of the event reported in GCN 31925, show that the
emission is not due to a GRB.
The NITRATES analysis localizes this emission episode to the position
of the Sun and it is temporally coincident with a Class X flare, as
seen by NOAO's GOES.
The emission seen is due to a solar flare.
We apologize for any confusion caused.
