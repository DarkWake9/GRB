report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200208q at T0 = 2020-02-08
13:01:17.991 (UTC) a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0
shows that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered
the 37% of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S200208q 90% c.l. LR
was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:
from 7.0e-08 to 7.4e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 72% of
the LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
