A. Cucchiara, D. Fox (PSU), A. Levan (Warwick U.) and
N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report:

On November 28.40 UT we observed the afterglow of the Swift
GRB 091127 (Troja et al. GCN 10191; Smith et al. GCN 10192)
with the GMOS-N spectrograph on Gemini North. 

The observation consists of 2 exposures of 900 seconds each
with the R400 grating, covering 4000-8000A wavelength range.

The spectra shows a bright featureless continuum and two emission
lines which we identified as [OIII]4959 and 5007 respectively
at the common redshift of z = 0.490.

Therefore we suggest this as redshift for GRB 091127.

We thank the Gemini-N support staff, in particular A. Stephens,
for performing these observations.
