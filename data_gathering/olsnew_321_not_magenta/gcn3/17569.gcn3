TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  17569
SUBJECT: GRB 150311A: Konus-Wind trigger at 16:16:24 is not a GRB

D. Frederiks, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, reports:

The Konus-Wind trigger at 16:16:24.884 mentioned by Morii et al. (GCN 17568), 
which is 111 s before the MAXI trigger, is actually due to a X2.1 class solar
flare. Therefore, taking into account the MAXI localization of the source,
we suggest that the Maxi trigger is unrelated to the Konus-Wind trigger.
