of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 180914B (Bissaldi et al. GCN Circ. 23232)
in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time
is 4.1 ks, distributed over 6 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single
sky location was 1.3 ks. The data were collected between T0+82.8 ks and
T0+93.8 ks, and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected and is above the RASS limit,
and is therefore likely the GRB afterglow. Using 579 s of PC mode data
and 2 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 332.35648, +25.06314 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 22h 09m 25.56s
Dec(J2000): +25d 03' 47.3"

with an uncertainty of 3.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 12.1 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position.  The source has a
mean count rate of 6.2e-02 ct/sec; we cannot determine at the present
time whether it is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00075/Source2.php.
