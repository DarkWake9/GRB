Using the data set from T-239.0 to T+963.1 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070129
(trigger #258408)  (Godet, et al., GCN Circ. 6053).  The BAT
ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 37.001, 11.730 deg which is
    RA(J2000) = 2h 28m 0.3s
    Dec(J2000) = +11d 43' 46.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 41%.

The mask-tagged light curve showed that the trigger was on a precursor to
the main burst which started at approximately T+200 sec, coincident with
the detections reported in the XRT (Godet et al, GCN 6056).    Emission
started at ~T-180 sec, then continued through a series of peaks out
to ~T+160 sec, where there was a dip in the light curve preceding the main
peak of the prompt emission which lasted until T+380 sec.
This was followed by some possible low level emission out to ~T+600 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 460 +- 20 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-125.0 to T+373.9 is best fit by
a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.05 +- 0.16. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
3.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+361.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
