TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  18036
SUBJECT: GRB 150716A: KAIT Optical Upper Limit
DATE:    15/07/20 03:54:00 GMT
FROM:    Xiang-Gao Wang at GuangXi U  <wangxg@gxu.edu.cn>

Xianggao Wang (UC Berkeley, GXU, UNLV), WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on 
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:  The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150716A (Kocevski et al., GCN 18027) starting at 07:10:08 UT, 195 s after the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image. After combining 6 x 20 s clear-band images, we do not detect the optical source reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 18029), nor any other new source within the XRT error circle (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 18030). The upper limit is estimated to be about 20.9 mag at a mean time of 443 s after the trigger, calibrated to USNO B1.0.
