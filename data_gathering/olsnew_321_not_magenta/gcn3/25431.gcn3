report:

We imaged the field of GRB 190821A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 921722) with the T60 tele-operated telescope (D=60cm)
located at Les Makes Observatory, Reunion Island, France.

The observations started 790s after the GRB trigger.
On the first image of 120s (Clear filter) we detect the
optical afterglow compatible with the position of XRT
(Lien et al. GCNC 25427).
