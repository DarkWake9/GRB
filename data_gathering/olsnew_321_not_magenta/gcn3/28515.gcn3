Swift observed the field of IceCube 200926A (GCN Circ. 28504) between 11:44:33
2020 September 26 and 13:45:03 on 2020 September 26, collecting a total of 3.8 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found 5 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are either known X-ray
sources, consistent with catalogued fluxes, or are unknown but with count rate
consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not claim any of
them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 200926A
A futher 4 sources were detected, but their detection flag of 4 indicates that
they were likely spurious.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 6-8 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:
