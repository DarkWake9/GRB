E. Bissaldi (Politecnico & INFN Bari), D. Kocevski (NASA/MSFC),
and N. Omodei (Stanford Univ) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:


At 12:31:47.25 UT on September 14, 2018 Fermi-LAT detected
high-energy emission from GRB 180914A, which was also detected by
Fermi-GBM (trigger 558621112 / 180914522).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 52.74, -5.26 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.40 deg (90 % containment,
statistical error only). This was 87 deg from the LAT boresight
at the time of the trigger.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event
rate that is spatially correlated with the trigger with high significance.
The highest-energy photon is a 5.1 GeV event which is
observed 630 s after the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elisabetta Bissaldi (elisabetta.bissaldi@ba.infn.it).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
