report:

NEAR, Konus, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed this burst (GCN #676).
(The NEAR XGRS detector has been turned back on and is operating
nominally; Ulysses data will not be available until tomorrow due
to the Memorial Day holiday).  Triangulation gives an annulus 
centered at RA(2000)=312.943 deg., Decl.(2000)=-26.625 deg., with radius
47.850 +/- 0.171 degrees (3 sigma).  This is consistent with,
but does not further constrain, the BeppoSAX WFC error box.  The
addition of Ulysses data is expected to improve this localization.
