M. Perri (SSDC & INAF-OAR), V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), A. D'Ai
(INAF-IASFPA), J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U.
Toronto), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L.
Page (U. Leicester) and E. Troja report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 3.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 220302A (Troja et al. GCN
Circ. 31661), from 32.5 ks to 160.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 31666).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.7 (+0.5, -0.4).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01094950.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
