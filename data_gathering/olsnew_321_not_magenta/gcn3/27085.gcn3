MASTER OT J044008.76-651302.3 (GCN 27077) is located in the field LMC542
that is regularly observed by the <a
href="http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/">OGLE</a>
survey (Udalski et al. 2015). The object was detected on images taken on
2020-02-04 and 2020-02-12, before the LIGO/Virgo trigger. It is therefore
unrelated to S200213t.

I-band magnitudes:
