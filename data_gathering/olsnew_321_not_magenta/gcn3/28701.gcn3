We observed the field of GRB 201020A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 28696) using 
the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 
15x120s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 13:48:25 UT on 
2020-10-20, i.e., 8.02 hr after the BAT trigger.

The optical afterglow (Ambrosi et al., GCN 28696; Adachi et al., GCN 
28697) of the burst is clearly detected in our stacked image, with r = 
19.69 +/- 0.06 mag at T_mid = 0.3461 day post-burst, calibrated with 
nearby PS1 stars.
