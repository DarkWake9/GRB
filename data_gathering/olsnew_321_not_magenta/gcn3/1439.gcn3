"We have observed the field of the GRB/XRF 020427 (GCN Circulars 1383, 1384,
1386, 1390, 1394) on 11.388-11.397 June 2002 with the 8.2-m VLT telescope
at Paranal ESO's observatory (equipped with FORS2). Imagery was obtained
in the B- and R-bands (300-s exposure time each) under rather poor seeing
conditions (1".2). The position of the likely X-ray afterglow detected by
BSAX and followed-up by Chandra (GCN Circulars 1387, 1392) is coincident
with the north part of a extended (about 4" x 2"), blue object with R =
23.3 +/- 0.2 and B = 23.8 +/- 0.4 which is consistent with the galaxy system
reported independently by Fruchter et al. (GCN Circ. 1440). An identification
chart is posted at www.iaa.es/~ajct/XRFs/xrf02042
