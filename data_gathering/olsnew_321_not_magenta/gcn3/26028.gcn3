A. Melandri, S.Covino, D. Fugazza, P. Dâ€™Avanzo (INAF/OAB), on behalf of the REM team, report:


We observed the field of GRB191016A (Gropp et al. GCN 26008) with the REM 60cm robotic telescope located at the ESO premise of La Silla (Chile). The observations were performed starting from about 6 min after the event and were carried in the g, r, i, z bands. 

The optical counterpart (Watson et al. GCN 26010; Zheng & Filippenko GCN 26011; Watson et al. GCN 26015; Hu et al. GCN 26017; Kim et al. 26018; Toma et al. GCN 26019; Siegel & Gropp GCN 26024) is detected in the optical bands. A preliminary photometry gives:

r = 16.1 +- 0.2 at 13 min from the GRB time.

Magnitudes are calibrated against the APASS catalogue.
