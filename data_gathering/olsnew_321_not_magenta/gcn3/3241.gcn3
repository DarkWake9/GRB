Angelini, F. Marshall, and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC)  report on behalf of the 
Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 05:44:03 UT on 12th April 2005 
(GCN Circ 3237). The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT 
position and the XRT began taking data at 05:45:42 UT.  The XRT was in 
Auto state but was not able to centroid on the afterglow due to low source 
brightness. From downlinked data we find a uncataloged X-ray source 
located at:

RA(J2000) = 12:04:25.3,
Dec(J2000) = -1:12:02.2.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 191 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 
3237.
