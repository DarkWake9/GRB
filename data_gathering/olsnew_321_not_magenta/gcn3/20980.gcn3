and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170402A (Fermi GBM trigger #512808659;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 06:50:51.076) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 06:50:52.11 on 2 April 2017.
The burst signal was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows several peaks.  The entire
burst episode starts at T+2 sec and ends at T+12 sec.  Two bright
emissions peak at T+3 sec and T+5 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 7.5 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
