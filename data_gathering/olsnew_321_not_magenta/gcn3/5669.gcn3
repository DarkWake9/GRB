We have imaged the field of GRB 060930 with the TNT 0.8m telescope
at Xinglong Observatory.Observations started about 2.74 hours after the 
burst under bad condition (cloudy and high airmass). in our combined
 6*10 minutesR band image, we do not detect any new source  down to
 ~17.25 with mean time 3.55 hours after the burst derived from  USNO A2.0
