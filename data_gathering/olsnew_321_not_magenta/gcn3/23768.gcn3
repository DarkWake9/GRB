report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 07:19:07.57 UT on 22 January 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190122A (trigger 569834352 / 190122305),
which was also detected by the Fermi/LAT (Longo et al. 2019, GCN 23767).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 26
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single FRED-like pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 54 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.8 s to T0+22.3 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with index -1.59 +/- 0.01.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.95 +/- 0.10)E-7 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
