The long GRB 220606C triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 13:35:14.394 UTC on 6 June 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1338557524/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by only SGM.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts
at T+3.1 sec, peaks at T+4.1 sec, and ends at T+47.4 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 30.4 +/- 7.8 sec
and 6.9 +/- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
