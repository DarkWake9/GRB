collaboration

The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope (Hawaii) automatically reacted to the
Swift burst GRB061126 (trigger=240766, Sbarufatti et al. GCN 5854).
Observations started about 4.3 min after the trigger time. We report
the detection of the optical counterpart at the position

RA(J2000)  =  05:46:24.43
Dec(J2000) = +64:12:39.00

The automatic pipeline LT-TRAP identified a fading afterglow in BVRi'
filters, and we estimate an initial magnitude (10 second integration)
R = 15.97 +/- 0.05 (wrt USNOB) at t=4.30 min.

From the first 30 minutes of observations, a temporal decay index of
alpha ~ 1.0 has been measured.

Further observations and analysis are ongoing.
