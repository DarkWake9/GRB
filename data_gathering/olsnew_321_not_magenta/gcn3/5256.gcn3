Using the data set from T-120 s to T+180 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060614 (trigger #214805)
(Parsons et al 2006, GCN 5252). The BAT ground-calculated position is
(RA,Dec) = 320.88, -53.035  { 21h 23m 31.8s , -53d 02' 04.4" }
[deg; J2000]+-1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 16%.

The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows an unusual multi-peaked burst
structure that begins with an initial bright, ~ 6 second wide peak
followed by a set of 5 fainter and somewhat softer peaks that increase
in intensity. After about T+45s, the light curve shows a smooth slope
down to the baseline level for a total duration of T90 (15-350 keV) =
102 +/- 5 sec.

The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.13 +- 0.04. The
fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.17+- 0.04 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.  The
1-sec peak photon flux measured from T - 1.3 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 11.6 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
