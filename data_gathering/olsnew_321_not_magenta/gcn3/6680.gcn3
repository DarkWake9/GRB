E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and D.L. Kaplan (MIT) report:

"Starting on July 29.315 UT we observed the XRT position of the short 
burst GRB 070729 (GCN #6678) with Persson's Auxiliary Nasmyth Infrared 
Camera (PANIC) on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope.  A total of 6 min 
were obtained in the Ks band in 0.55" seeing.  We find a single, extended 
object within the XRT error circle with Ks ~ 18.2 mag, located at:

         RA  = 03:45:15.52
         DEC = -39:19:28.7

No point sources are visible within the XRT error circle to a 3-sigma
depth of about 21.3 mag.  Further observations are in progress."
