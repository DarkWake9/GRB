F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and J.M. Gelbord (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of SGR 1833-0832
71 s after the BAT trigger (Gelbord et al., GCN Circ. 10526).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(Evans and Goad, GCN_Circ. 10529) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) for the first finding chart (FC)
exposures and subsequent exposures are:

The values quoted above are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the very large reddening in the direction of the source
(Schlegel et al. 1998). The large X-ray column density to the source found 
with the Swift/XRT (Gelbord and Vetere, GCN Circ. 10531) also
indicates very large optical extinction.
