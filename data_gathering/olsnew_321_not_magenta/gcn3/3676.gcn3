SUBJECT: GRB050724: Radio Observation

P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf
of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB050724 (GCN 3665) with the Very Large
Array at 8.5 GHz on July 25.09. We identify one radio source that is
~9" west from the center of the XRT error circle (GCN#3669). Its
position is (J2000): RA= 16:24:44.35, Dec= -27:32:26.9.

We note that, within our current astrometric errors this source is
positionally coincident with with the bright galaxy identified as
Source D by Bloom et al. (GCN#3672). Based on background source
counts, we expect 0.02 sources per square arcminute above this
brightness (~170 uJy). Further observations are planned to determine
the nature of this radio source.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
