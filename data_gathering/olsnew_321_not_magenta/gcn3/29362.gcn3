The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:26:17 UT on 27 Jan 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210127A (trigger 633421582.019982 / 210127268).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 54.2, Dec = 41.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 36m, 41d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 18.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 31.0 degrees.
