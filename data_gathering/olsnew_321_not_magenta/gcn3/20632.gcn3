At 22:33:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170208B (trigger=737463).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 127.155, -9.027 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 28m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 01' 35"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several overlapping peaks
with a total duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~14,500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 22:34:40.6 UT, 61.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 127.14389,
-9.02979 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 08h 28m 34.53s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 01' 47.2"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 40 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (5.32 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 2.9
(+2.27/-2.01) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 7.16e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
126 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.05. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. H. Siegel (siegel AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
