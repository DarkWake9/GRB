The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2020-10-14 at 02:13:27.53 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The threshold astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 1.707 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134599_66310113.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2020-10-14
Time:  02:13:27.53 UT
RA: 221.22 (+1.00 -0.75 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 14.44 (+0.67 -0.46  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL J1451.5+1415 at RA: 222.89 deg, Dec: 14.26 deg J2000 (1.63 deg away from the best-fit event position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
