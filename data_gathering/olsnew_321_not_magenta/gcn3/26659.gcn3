The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:26:22 UT on 7 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200107B (trigger 600117987.8063 / 200107810).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 356.9, Dec = -80.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 47m, -80d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 61.0 degrees.
