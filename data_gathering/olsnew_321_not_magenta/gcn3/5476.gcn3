A. Gomboc reports on behalf of the Liverpool GRB group:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope (La Palma, Canary Islands) robotically
followed-up GRB060825 (SWIFT trigger 226382, Sato et al. GCN
5471) starting 2.6 min after the GRB trigger time. We do not find an
optical counterpart in 6 x 10s co-added images at the mean time 5.7 min
after the trigger to a limiting magnitude of R~18.3.

Limiting magnitude has been derived with reference to USNOB1.
