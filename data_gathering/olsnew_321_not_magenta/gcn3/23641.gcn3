Swift has observed the field of the IceCube HESE neutrino candidate
IceCube-190104A (revision 1, https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/23605.gcn3),
utilizing its on-board 37-point tiling pattern to cover a region centered
on R.A., Dec. (J2000) = (357.98d, -26.65d), with a radius of approximately
1.1 degrees. Swift first started observing the initial location of the
IceCube-190104A, ~3 hours after the neutrino arrival time: R.A., Dec.
(J2000) = (359.3299d, -25.3659d) with an angular uncertainty of 0.42d, 50%
containment (revision 0,
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/notices_amon/68269692_131999.amon), using a
19-point tiling pattern. Upon receiving the GCN Circular update from the
IceCube collaboration on the event refined direction and localization,
Swift slewed to observe the new position with a 37-point tiling.


Swift-XRT collected ~400 s per field of PC mode data per tile. The new
observations were taken between 14:47:27 UT on 2019 January 4 and 10:22:20
UT on 2019 January 5, and covered 3.8 square degrees.

There is a patch of diffuse X-ray emission around R.A. 23h 51m 39.27s, Dec.
-26d 05’ 05.2” which gives rise to multiple spurious point-source
detections; upon review, however, there is no evidence of point-like X-ray
sources in this region. SIMBAD reports the galaxy [CKS2006] 11 at this
position. The diffuse X-rays likely come from the galaxy cluster Abell 2667
(located at R.A. 23h 51m 39.37s, Dec. -26d 05’ 02.7”).


A single point-like X-ray source is detected at R.A. 23h 50m 29.68s, Dec.
-26d 20’ 45.2” with an uncertainty of 5.4” (90% conf. radius). This matches
the catalogued X-ray source XMMSL2 J235029.0-262037 with its current flux
at 2.4-sigma below the catalogued level from XMM-Newton Slew Survey Source
Catalogue. SIMBAD lists a QSO ([VV2006] J235029.6-262046) at 2.7" from the
XRT position for this source; the object is a broad-line quasar at redshift
z=0.217 with M_i~-23 mag and L_X~10^44 erg s^-1 (Jones et al. 2009, MNRAS,
399 683). Its mean XRT count rate from our observations is 1.3(+0.6,
-0.5)e-2 ct s^-1.

The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate in the rest of the field is 0.02
ct s^-1, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 8.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
for a typical AGN spectrum (NH=3e20 cm^-2, Gamma=1.7).
