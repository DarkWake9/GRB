The long GRB 121029A ( Fermi-GBM detection : von Kienlin et al., GCN 13925)
was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
 energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 08:24:18 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows multi-peaked structure starting at T0-2
s, ending
 at T0+20 s with a duration
 (T90) of about 15 seconds. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 6.05
(-0.33, +0.29) x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.
 The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+14 s was 4.63 (-0.42, +0.44)
photons/cm^2/s in the same
 energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to
T0+20 s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.76 (-0.21, +0.23) (chi^2/d.o.f = 6.9/14).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
