Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140102A (trigger #582760)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 15653).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 211.915, 1.332 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  14h 07m 39.5s 
  Dec(J2000) = +01d 19' 54.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 99%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows many overlapping peaks starting 
at ~T-0.2 sec, peaking at ~T+0.7 sec and ending at ~T+5 sec with a long 
tail emission out to T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 65 +- 15 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.15 to T+131.22 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.38 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.7 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.97 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 29.8 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
