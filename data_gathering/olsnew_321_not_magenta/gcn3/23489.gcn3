Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181202A (trigger #874334)
(Cannizzo et al., GCN Circ. 23482).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 280.737, 27.976 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  18h 42m 56.9s
  Dec(J2000) = +27d 58' 33.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure that starts
at ~T0 and ends at ~T+7 s. The two peaks occur at ~T+1 s and ~T+6 s, respectively.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.56 +- 0.61 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.26 to T+6.76 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.61 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.69 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
