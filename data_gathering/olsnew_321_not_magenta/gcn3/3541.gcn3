TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3541
SUBJECT: GRB 050607: MDM Observation
DATE:    05/06/09 16:44:29 GMT
FROM:    Jules Halpern at Columbia U.  <jules@astro.columbia.edu>

J. P. Halpern (Columbia), J. Kemp (Joint Astronomy Centre and Columbia),
and N. Mirabal (U. Michigan), report on behalf of the MDM Observatory
GRB follow-up team:

We reobserved the afterglow of GRB 050607 in the R band with the
MDM 2.4m telescope for 30 minutes starting on June 8 08:15 UT,
23 hr after the burst.  Seeing was approximately 1.1", similar 
to the previous night.  An upper limit of R > 24.0 for a point
source is found at the position of the afterglow.  The possible
host galaxy (Rhoads, GCN #3540) would be difficult to quantify
in our image due to the nearby bright star.
