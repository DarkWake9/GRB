S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The GRB 060912 (Swift-BAT trigger 229185, GCN 5558)
triggered Konus-Wind at 50157.788 s UT (13:55:57.788).
As observed by Konus-Wind, it had a duration of ~8 s.
Its spectrum is well fitted by a power law model in
the energy range 20 keV - 2 MeV, with
alpha = -1.94 +/- 0.2 for time interval T0 - (T0 + 8s).

The burst fluence is ~4x10-6 erg/cm2 and the 256-ms peak flux
is 1.8x10-6 erg/cm2 s (both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).
