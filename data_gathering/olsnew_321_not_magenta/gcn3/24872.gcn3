The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:50:06 UT on 22 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190622A (trigger 582886211.27625 / 190622368).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 165.2, Dec = -53.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 00m, -53d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 22.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 23.0 degrees.
