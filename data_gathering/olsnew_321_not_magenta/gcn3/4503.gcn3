TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4503
SUBJECT: GRB 060108: IR observations of afterglow
DATE:    06/01/14 00:32:39 GMT
FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <anl@star.le.ac.uk>

A.J. Levan, N.R. Tanvir (U. Hertfordshire), L. Fuhrman (JACH) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration.

Our UKIRT K-band observations of GRB 060108 reported originally
in GCN 4457 also show an object at the location of the revised X-ray
afterglow position suggested by Butler & Bloom (GCN 4500).  The source is
point like and has a magnitude of approximately K=18.4. The implied i-K
colour based on the optical detection at 35 minutes (Monfardini et al. GCN
4502) is i-K ~ 3.

We note that inspection of the SDSS g-band pre-image of the field of GRB
060108 also reveals a marginal detection at the location of this source,
presumably the host galaxy.

Further observations are planned.
