"The MeerLICHT optical wide-field telescope, located at the Sutherland
station of the South African Astronomical Observatory, South Africa,
covered the 95% probability-ranked area of the second preliminary
skymap of S190814bv [1]. With MeerLICHT's 2.7 square degree
field-of-view sampled at 0.56"/pix, a set of 24 fields covered the 95%
area. Each field was observed in a set of u, q (440-720nm), i bands in
one-minute exposures per filter, starting at 23:11 UT 2019-08-14, and
continued throughout the night until dawn at 04:19 UT 2019-08-15. Each
field was covered at least twice with a 2-hour time separation. The
majority was covered a third time before dawn. Sky conditions were
photometric, with a seeing around 2.5" in q-band. Limiting magnitudes
(5-sigma point-source) were 18.5 mag (u), 19.7 mag (q) and 19.1 mag
(i) in 60s exposures affected by full-moon conditions. Data processing 
is ongoing and results will be reported when they become available. Monitoring of the updated skymap [2] will continue over the coming 
nights."

The MeerLICHT telescope [3] is designed, built and operated by the
MeerLICHT consortium consisting of Radboud University, the University
of Cape Town, the Univerity of Oxford, the South African Astronomical
Observatory, the University of Manchester and the University of
Amsterdam, with support from the Netherlands Research School for
Astronomy NOVA, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research
NWO, the KU Leuven and the South African Radio Astronomical
Observatory.
