M. H. Siegel (PSU) and T. N. Ukwatta (MSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 04:20:05 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 121202A (trigger=540255).  Swift did not slew because
of the Earth limb observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 256.815, +23.952, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 07m 16s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 57' 07"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows muliple peaks
with a total duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~13 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+44.1
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (sro AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
