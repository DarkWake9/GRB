Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130505A (trigger #555163)
(Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circ. 14563).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 137.060, 17.485 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 08m 14s
   Dec(J2000) = +17d 29' 06"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 2%.

The mask-weighted light curve starts at ~T-3 sec, peaks at ~T+0.3 sec,
drops sginificantly at ~T+5 sec, and then has a long tail out to ~T+350 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 88 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.0 to T+363.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.18 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-05 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 30.0 +- 3.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. The spectral results may be skewed toward harder values because of
the effects of the extreme partial coding.
