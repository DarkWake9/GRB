report:

SkyNet observed the localization of GRB 060908 with four of the PROMPT
telescopes starting at 08:58:25 UT.

We note a very bright uncatalogued rapidly fading source at approximately
02:07:19, +00:20:30.

In the r' initial image beginning at 08:59:07 UT, 105 s after the trigger,
the source is at approximately r ~ 15.

Further analysis is underway.
