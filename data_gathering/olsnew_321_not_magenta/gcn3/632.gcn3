K. Hurley, R. M. Kippen, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses,
BATSE, and NEAR GRB teams, report:

We have derived a refined error box for GRB000408 (=BATSE
8069, GCN 626), whose area is ~60 sq. arcmin.  Its coordinates
are:

  RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)            
9 h  9 m 17.91 s     +66 o 34 '  49.78 "  (CENTER)
9 h 11 m 30.33 s     +66 o 32 '  31.07 "  (CORNER)
9 h  8 m 10.97 s     +66 o 33 '  43.86 "  (CORNER)
9 h 10 m 24.59 s     +66 o 35 '  54.27 "  (CORNER)
9 h  7 m  3.18 s     +66 o 37 '   2.96 "  (CORNER)


Further refinements are still possible.
