A. Kusakin (Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report 
on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 140610A (Evans  et al., GCN 
16375) with Zeiss-1000 (East) telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical 
Observatory starting on June 10, (UT) 16:49:37, i.e. 18 minutes after 
GRB trigger. We took several images in R-filter. Within enhanced XRT 
position (Evans et al., GCN 16388) we do not find any new source neither 
in the first image nor in a stacked image.

Details of the photometry are following:
