For GRB 080503 (Trigger 310785, GCNs 7665 & 7673),
the spectral lag analysis of the data from T-1 sec to T+1 sec
(the initial spike), yields a lag of -13 +/- 9 msec for the
15-25 to 50-100 keV bands using lightcurve binnings of 4, 8 and 16 msec.
For the on-going emission (T+10 to T+220 sec), the signal is too weak
and lacking sufficient structure to yield a significant lag measurement.

Expanding on the total-burst spectral analysis in GCN 7673,
we have divided the burst into an initial phase (T+0.0 to T+0.7 sec)
and the extended phase (T+10 to T+170 sec).  The simple power law fits are:
  Phase     PLI            Norm(@50keV)         Chi2/DoF
  Initial   1.59 +/-0.28  (8.15 +- 1.5)E-3      69/59
  Extended  1.91 +/-0.12  (1.19 +- 0.08)E-3     52/59
The units of Normalization are ph/cm2/s/keV.

This lag value plus the spectral results puts this burst
in the short hard burst category.
