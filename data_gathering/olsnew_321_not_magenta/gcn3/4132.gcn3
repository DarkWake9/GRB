TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4132
SUBJECT: GRB 051022A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    05/10/22 15:02:53 GMT
FROM:    Brad Schaefer at LSU  <schaefer@grb.phys.lsu.edu>

B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State University) reports on behalf of the 
ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded to 
GRB 051022A (HETE trigger 3950), producing images beginning 6.3 s after 
the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image at 
13:08:59.8 UT, 61.3 s after the burst, under fair conditions. We took 10 
5-sec, 10 20-sec and 50 60-sec eposures. These unfiltered images are 
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma error circle, for both single images and coadding into sets of 10. 
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 14.5-17.2; we set 
the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
