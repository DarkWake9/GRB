On 2020-02-15 03:30 UT, we used the Double Beam Spectrograph (Oke & Gunn 1982) on the Palomar 200-inch telescope to observe ZTF20aanakcd/AT2020cmr (Reusch et al., GCN #27068), a transient discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility (Graham et al., 2019; Bellm et al., 2019) during the follow-up of the binary neutron star merger candidate S200213t (LVC, GCN #2704).

The optical spectrum shows intermediate width Balmer emission features consistent with a Type IIn supernova at z=0.077. We also confirmed that the redshift of the transient is consistent with the host galaxy redshift, extracted from the same observations, based on the analysis of Balmer and [S II] lines.  We conclude that ZTF20aanakcd/AT2020cmr is unrelated to S200213t.
