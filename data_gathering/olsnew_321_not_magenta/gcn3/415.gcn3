report:

"We have obtained three 10-minute exposures of the BeppoSAX 
position of GRB 990907 (Gandolfi et al. GCN 404, 405) with the 
0.61-m Mount John University Observatory (MJUO) telescope. 
The images were taken on Sep 9.40 UT through a broad band filter 
(R + I bandpass). After a visual comparison with the Digital Sky 
Survey, no sources varying by more than 0.3 mag were seen to the 
DSS-2 limit within the BSAX NFI error box (GCN 409) in agreement 
with the negative results provided by Palazzi et al. (GCN 413)."
