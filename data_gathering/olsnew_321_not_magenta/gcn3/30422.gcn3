Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210708A (trigger #1059460)
(Sbarufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 30413).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 173.759, -49.164 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  11h 35m 02.3s 
  Dec(J2000) = -49d 09' 50.2" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 94%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak of duration about 3 seconds,
starting just before T0.   T90 (15-350 keV) is 2.77 +- 0.70 sec (estimated error 
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.69 to T+2.44 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.05 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
