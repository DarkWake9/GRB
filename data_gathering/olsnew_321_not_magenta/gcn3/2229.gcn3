E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 66151
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  5.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 151.734, 35.758 degrees, whose radius is 67.870 +/-  0.264
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival directions to those portions of the annulus between
RA, Decl = 94, -6.6 degrees and 172, -29.5 degrees.

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved further, but as the
event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be
derived for it.
