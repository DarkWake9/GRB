report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:22:58.47 UT on 10 March 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160310A (trigger 479262182 / 160310016),
which was also detected by the LAT
(G.Vianello et al. 2016, GCN 19158)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 68 
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of five pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 18.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.5 s to T0+20.0 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.1 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 129.0 +/- 9.5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+11.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 7.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
