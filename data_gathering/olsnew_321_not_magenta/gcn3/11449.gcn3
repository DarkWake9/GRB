D. Malesani and A. de Ugarte Postigo (DARK/NBI), report:

We notice the presence of an object within the error circle of the X-ray 
afterglow of GRB 101213 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 11448; see also 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/). The object is visible in the DSS as well 
in gri images of the SDSS. It is classified as a galaxy in the SDSS 
catalog. The coordinates are:

RA(J2000) = 16:05:15.20
Dec(J2000) = 21:53:49.2

Magnitudes from the SDSS are (AB):

g = 22.07 +- 0.09
r = 21.22 +- 0.07
i = 21.12 +- 0.12

Despite the bad visibility of this GRB right now, the field will be 
observable from the Northern hemisphere in a couple of weeks. Given the 
brightness of the potential host galaxy, and hence the likely low 
redshift, a search for an associated SN may be attempted (also to 
confirm the object as the GRB host).
