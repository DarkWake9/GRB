TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3724
SUBJECT: GRB050801: GCN XRT position is incorrect
DATE:    05/08/01 18:50:03 GMT

The XRT position sent through GCN for GRB050801 is not correct due to the 
XRT centroiding on a artifact in the CCD, and not the afterglow. The 
current best position for this from Swift is the BAT position.

[GCN OPS NOTE(01aug05): Per author's request, "050701" was changed to "050801"
in both places.]
