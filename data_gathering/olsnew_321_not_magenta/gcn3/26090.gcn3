SUBJECT: GRB 191029A: Swift-XRT observations

J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), G.
Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), M. Perri (ASDC) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 191029A at 12:06:55.2 UT,
3095.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 352.15967,
-40.50028 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 28m 38.32s
   Dec(J2000) = -40d 30' 01.0"
with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 141 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.78
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
