L. Rhodes, R. Fender, D. Williams, J. Bright (Oxford), K. Mooley (NRAO, Caltech; Jansky Fellow), A. Horesh (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem), D. Green, D. Titterington (MRAO) and the JAGWAR collaboration.

We observed the position of the reported GW190426c afterglow candidate: ZTF19aassfws (D. A. Perley et al. GCN 24331) with the AMI Large Array at a central frequency of 15.5GHz. We started observing on 2019 May 10.16 for 4 hrs. We find no significant radio emission at the coordinates of ZTF19aassfws and therefore report a 3 sigma upper limit of 177uJy.

We thank the MRAO staff for scheduling these observations.
