P.A. Price (Caltech), A. Gal-Yam (Wise Obs.) and J.S. Bloom (Caltech) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the IPN error box of GRB010126 (Hurley et al. GCN #922)
with the Wise 40-inch telescope in R-band starting at approx Jan 27.04 UT.
Our 8x600s images cover the entire error box with two overlapping pointings.
The effective integration time varies over the area of the error box.  From
visual inspection of the combined image, we do not find any objects which
are not present on the Digital Sky Survey 2 red plate."

[GCN OPS NOTE (27jan01): A typo on the observation time was corrected
from 21.04 UT to 27.04 UT.]
