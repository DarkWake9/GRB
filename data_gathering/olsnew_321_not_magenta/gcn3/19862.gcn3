We observed the field of GRB 160824A (Evans   et al., GCN 19855)  with K-800 
(0.8m f/2.9)   telescope  of ISON/Terskol   observatory. We obtained several 
unfiltered images starting on  August 24 (UT) 23:58:36.  We detected 
optical source in coordinates
(J2000) 05:20:21.18 +40:01:43.5 with uncertainty of 1 arcsec in both 
coordinates. This is 2.6 arcsec apart of the center of the enhanced XRT 
error circle (Goad et al., GCN 19857).  At this time we cannot say nothing 
about variability of the object.  It is not clear whether our source is the 
same as the source reported by Marshall et al. (GCN 19860).  Preliminary 
photometry of a combined image is following
