The long-duration GRB 201116A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 28897,
Kunzweiler et al., GCN Circ. 28898;
Fermi-LAT detection: Axelsson et al., GCN Circ. 28907)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=2988.982 s UT (00:49:48.982).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
which starts at ~T0-1.3 s and has a total duration of ~9.5 s.
The emission is seen up to ~4 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB201116_T02988/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.46(-0.34,+0.33)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+3.792 s,
of 9.01(-2.15,+2.14)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+7.680 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.53(-0.23,+0.25),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.56(-0.69,+0.23),
the peak energy Ep = 220(-28,+40) keV
(chi2 = 90/97 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
