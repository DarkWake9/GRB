Observations of GRB 030329 (HETE trigger #2652, Ricker et al., GCN 1997)
with the TEK 1K CCD mounted on the 1-meter telescope of Wise Observatory, Israel
revealed that starting approximately March 30 21:00 UT, the OT brightened.

The light curve, decaying with a power-law index alpha=0.7 (Lipkin et al. GCN 2034),
reached a minimum R-band magnitude of about 16.45 at approximately 21:00 UT.
Over the next three hours the OT brightened, reaching R=16.25 at approximately
March 31.0 UT, consistent with later observations by Stanek et al. (GCN 2041).
