S. B. Cenko (NASA / GSFC), D. A. Perley (Caltech), A. Cucchiara (UCSC), W.
Fong (CfA), and A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the location of the X-ray afterglow (Beardmore et al., GCN
15117) of the short GRB 130822A (Kocevski et al., GCN 15112) with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 8 m Gemini North telescope.  We
obtained a total integration of 600 s in the i' filter beginning at 12:56
UT on 23 August 2013 (0.88 d after the Swift trigger).  We detect no
sources within the enhanced XRT error circle.  Using nearby point sources
from SDSS for calibration, we calculate an upper limit of i' > 24.5 mag at
this time.
