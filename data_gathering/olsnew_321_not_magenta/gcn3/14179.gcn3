Moseley (GSFC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 130131B (Siegel et al., GCN 14159) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro M&aacute;rtir. Between 2013 February 1.42 and
2013 February 1.54 UTC (14.86 to 17.70 hrs after the BAT trigger), we
obtained 1.96 hrs exposure in the r and i bands and 0.73 hrs exposure in
the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We detect no source within the XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 14165).
In comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we derive the following upper limits
(3-sigma) in the AB magnitude system:

 r' > 23.8
 i' > 23.1
Z > 22.1
Y > 21.7
J  > 21.8
H > 21.4

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.

Pedro M&aacute;rtir.
