O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:10:00.46 UT on the 5th of January 2014, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150105A
(trigger 442131003 / 150105257). The GBM on-ground location,
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 124.3, Dec =-14.8,
with an uncertainty of 1.0 degree (radius, 1-sigma
containment,statistical only; there is additionally a
systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to
3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several bright peaks with
a duration (T90) of about 74 s (50-300 keV). The time-
averaged spectrum from T0+3.0 s to T0+76.7 s is well fit by
a Band function with Epeak = 52 +/- 2 keV,
Alpha = -0.91 +/- 0.07 and Beta = -2.25 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.4 +/- 0.1)E-05  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+44.6 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 23.5 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
