G. Da Costa (RSAA, ANU) and N. Noel (IAC) report:

We have reduced our observations of the afterglow of GRB 041006 (GCN
#2765).  From observations of several photometric standards taken the
same night, we find that the star at coordinates 00:54:37.96,
+01:13:00.7 J2000 (i.e. south west of the offset star in the finder from
GCN #2766) has B = 18.28 mag and V = 17.35 mag.  From these, we estimate
that the afterglow had a B-V colour of approximately 0.28 +/- 0.03 mag
around 2004 Oct 6.58 UT.
