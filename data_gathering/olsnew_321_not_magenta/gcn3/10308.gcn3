J. A. Kennea (PSU) and W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift Team:

Swift began a target of opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL detected 
GRB 100103A (GCN #10307), at 18:36UT on January 3rd, 2010, approximately 
54 mins after the INTEGRAL detection. In approximately 2.5 ks of Photon 
Counting mode data, we find an uncatalogued source in the XRT field of 
view with a preliminary position of RA, Dec (J2000) = 112.37327, 
-34.487811, which is equivalent to:

RA(J2000)  =  07h 29m 29.5s
Dec(J2000) = -34d 29' 16.1"

with an estimated uncertainty of 6 arcmins radius (90% confidence). This 
position lies 0.5 arcmins from the INTEGRAL reported position. We 
currently cannot confirm if this source is fading.
