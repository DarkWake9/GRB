report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:56:18.14 UT on the 19th of February 2015, the Fermi 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 160219A 
(trigger 477557782 / 160219289). The on-ground calculated location, 
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 350.6, Dec = -29.7 deg.
(J2000 degrees, equivalent to 23h 22m 24s, -29d 42'), with a 
statistical uncertainty of 6.34 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which we 
have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of GRBs having 
a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg 
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ). 

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight for the IPN position 
is 51 degrees (Svinkin et al. 2016, GCN 19035).

The GBM light curve consists of two short pulses with a duration
(T90) of about 3.5 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-0.064 s to T0+3.456 s is best fit by a power law function with
an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is
-0.97 +/- 0.15 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is
689 +/- 308 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.25 +/- 0.12)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.00 s in the 10-1000 keV band is
19.2 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
