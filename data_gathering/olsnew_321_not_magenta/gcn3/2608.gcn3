After  HETE alert 3259 (Probable SRG1806-20)  MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had automatically imaging  the
corresponding area of the sky.  We have 10
unfiltered images of the error box (60s exposition, 6 square degrees
field) started at 28 May 2004	22:25:22 UT (after 10 minutes GRB time).
The limiting magnitude on the first image was about 17.5. The limiting
magnitude on sum  was about 18.6.

There is no  OT at SGR1806-20 within the Chandra error circle
as reported by (Eikenberry
et al. ApJ 563, L133; Kouveliotou et al., GCN Circ 2607).
