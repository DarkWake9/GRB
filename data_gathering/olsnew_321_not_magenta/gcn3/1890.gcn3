SUBJECT: GRB 030226: Confirmed decay index

P.A. Price and B.E. Warren (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 030226 (GCN ##1879,1880) with the
ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory.  We detect the afterglow
in a single 300 sec exposure with the Imager at Feb 26.67 UT.  Using the
same reference star as von Braun et al. (GCN #1881), we measure that the
afterglow was R ~ 19.2 mag at the epoch of our observation.  The derived
temporal decay index is alpha ~ 0.88, in agreement with the earlier index
reported by Fox et al. (GCN #1883).
