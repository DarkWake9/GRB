A.J. Levan (Hertfordshire), N.R. Tanvir (Leicester), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC) 
report for a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 060923A (Tanvir et al. GCN Circ 5587; Fox 
et al. GCN Circ 5597) in the R-band using the VLT and FORS2. At the 
location of the afterglow we find a faint, extended source (angular size 
~2") with R~25.5. We suggest this is likely to be the host galaxy of GRB 
060923A.

If this galaxy is the host of GRB 060923A then its detection in the R-band 
implies an upper limit for the redshift of z~5. Therefore we believe that 
extinction is the most likely cause for the extremely red J-K colour for 
the afterglow at early times.

We that the staff of the VLT for their excellent support.
