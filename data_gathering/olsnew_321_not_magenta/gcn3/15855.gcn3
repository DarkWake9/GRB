We again observed the field of GRB 140215A (Markwardt,, et al., GCN 15837)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/02 17.11 to 2014/02 17.20 UTC
(46.46 to 48.60 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.41
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.58 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-UVOT error circle, in comparison with 2MASS,
we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     22.19 +/- 0.24
  i     21.65 +/- 0.16
  Z     > 21.45
  Y     > 20.71
  J     > 20.61
  H     > 20.12

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Compared to our observations last
night (Littlejohns et al., GCN 15849), the source flux is consistent with a
continued fading as t^-1.

Mártir.
