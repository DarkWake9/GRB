U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140311A detected by SWIFT(trigger 591390)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy (member of ISSP:Italian Supernovae Search Project)

The observations started 1.89 hour after the GRB trigger,  
with our Newton telescope D=250 mm F/D=5.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added 15 exposures of 120 sec each.

We did not found any optical counterpart
in the error box of the XRTcandidate.
