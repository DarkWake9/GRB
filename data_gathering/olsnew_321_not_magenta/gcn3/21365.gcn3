Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170724A (trigger #764204)
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 21364).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 150.057, -1.025 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  10h 00m 13.7s
  Dec(J2000) = -01d 01' 31.0"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 58%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak complex structure that
starts at ~T-50 s and ends at ~T+80 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 98.0 +- 26.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-45.6 to T+63.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.46 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+35.92 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
