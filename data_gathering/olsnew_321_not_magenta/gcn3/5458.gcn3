E. O. Ofek and S. B. Cenko (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060814 (Moretti et al; GCN 5447) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.
We obtained 19 x 180 s i-band images and 15 x 180 s z-band images,
both at UTC 2006 August 15.24 (mid time; 0.28 d after the burst).
We identify the extended source reported by Malesani (GCN 5456),
on the edge of the revised XRT error circle (GCN 5451).
We note that this source is also detected in the SDSS
g-band image, and possibly also in the SDSS i-band image.
The magnitude of this source is g=22.9 and i=22.5, as measured
in the SDSS g-band and P60 i-band images, respectively.

We cannot identify any other sources within the XRT error circle
to a limiting magnitude of about 23.0 and 21.5 in i- and z-band, respectively.
