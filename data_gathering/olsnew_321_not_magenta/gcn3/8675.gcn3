On 18 Nov, the Zadko Telescope team observed the XRT field of GRB  
081118 reported by P. Evans (GCN 8525) using the 1 meter Zadko  
Telescope (in very early commissioning mode). Imaging commenced  
approx 1.96 hr post burst trigger using an unfiltered integrating CCD  
video camera and continued over a period of 1 hr.
  The OA candidate reported by GCN 8529 is seen in a selected stack  
of 40 x 5 second exposures, though it is near the detection limit.
  We do not have absolute standard star photometric calibration.
Using nearby USNO-B1 stars we estimate the limiting magnitude of the  
OA to be in the range 20.9 +- 0.5.

This message is quotable in publications.

David Coward and Timo Vaalsta report on behalf of the UWA Zadko  
Telescope Team.
