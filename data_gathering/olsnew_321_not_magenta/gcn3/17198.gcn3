We observed the afterglow of GRB141220A (Cummings et al. GCN 17196, Gorosabel
et al. GCN 17197) with OSIRIS at the 10.4m GTC. Observations began at 6:45 UT 
(50 min after the burst). In a first 600 s spectrum obtained with grism R1000B covering 
from 3750 to 7800 A we detect absorption features of AlII, FeII, MgII, MgI, at a redshift 
of 1.3195, including several absorptions of FeII* which make it very likely the redshift of 
the GRB. We also detect two MgII intervening systems at redshifts of 1.280 and 0.527.
