The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

The Coherent WaveBurst event candidate of 2017-01-20, with GraceDB ID
G270580, was initially reported (LSC and Virgo, GCN 20486) with an
estimated false alarm rate (FAR) of 1.6e-7 Hz, or about 5 per year.
Offline re-analysis has not changed this estimate.  At this time, we
do not have any evidence suggesting that the significance of this
event will increase on further study.
