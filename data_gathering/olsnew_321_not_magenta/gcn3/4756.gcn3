V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT La Palma),  M. Ibrahimov
(MAO), and A. Pozanenko (IKI), on behalf of larger GRB follow up
collaboration report:

We observed  error box of  GRB060121 (Arimoto  et al., GCN 4550) with 1.5m
telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in R-band on Jan. 23 between
(UT) 17:49 and 18:26. Within  XRT error circle (Mangano et al., GCN 4560)
we do not detect OT (Malesani  et al., GCN 4560)  and optical source
mentioned by Cenko et al., (GCN 4628). Coordinates of the closest to the XRT
error circle faint optical source, which is ~7" from the center of the XRT
error circle are:

RA(J2000)  = 09 09 52.18
DEC(J2000) = +45 39 37.4

with uncertainties in both coordinates of 0.3 arcsec. Brightness estimation
of the faint source is following:

Obs. time,          Exp.,   R (mag),    Mag.(UL), Seeing
(UT)                (s)

Jan. 23 17:49-18:26 1800  22.6(+/-0.3)  22.9      1.6"

The photometry and astrometry reduction is based on USNO A2.0.
