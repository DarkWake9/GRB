Maureen van den Berg, Jeroen Homan (Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera,
Itlay), Lex Kaper (UvA, NL), Nial Tanvir (University of Hertfordshire,
UK) Andrew Levan and Ingunn Burud (STScI, US) on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:


We have observed the error box of GRB 020819 with the CCD camera in
the JKT at La Palma on August 19/20.  The filter was R Harris.  We
obtained three sets of exposures at the beginning (2250 sec), middle
(3000 sec) and end (2250 sec) of the night. The limiting magnitude is
about R~22 for the first epoch.

We detect the OT candidate reported by Henden et al (GCN 1510) at
magnitude R ~ 21, but it does not fade from the beginning (UT ~ 23.814
hours) to the end (UT ~ 5.365 hours) of the night.
