K. D. Alexander (Harvard), W. Fong (Northwestern), P. K. G. Williams, E.
Berger (Harvard), and R. Margutti (Northwestern) report:

We report continued radio monitoring of LIGO/VIRGO G298048 with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (PI: Alexander, Program 17A-231). Our most recent
observations started on 2017 September 25.703 UT, or 39.2 days post-trigger
(LVC et al., GCN 21509), at a mean frequency of 6 GHz. We clearly detect
the radio counterpart (Hallinan et al., GCN 21929) at ~5-sigma significance
at a brightness comparable to the limit of our previous VLA observations.
Further observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for their assistance in scheduling and executing
these observations.
