D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 04:55:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150314A (trigger=634795).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 126.659d, +63.833d which is 
  RA(J2000) = 08h 26m 38s
  Dec(J2000) = +63d 50' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single complex peak
structure with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~45000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:56:17.9 UT, 85.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 126.6756, 63.8321 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +08h 26m 42.14s
   Dec(J2000) = +63d 49' 55.6"
with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 26 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

UVOT data is not immediately available. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is L. M. Z. Hagen (lea.zernow.hagen AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
