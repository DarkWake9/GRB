A. Goldstein (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 22:10:32.45 UT on 12 November 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101112A (trigger 311292634 / 101112924)
which was also detected by INTEGRAL (Gotz et al. 2010, GCN 11396)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.

The GBM lightcurve consists of a single bright pulse at trigger time
preceded by a smaller pulse ~6 s before trigger time with a total duration
(T90) of about 9.2 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.1 s
to T0+4.1 s is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 105.8 +/- 26.0 keV, 
alpha = -0.79 +/- 0.24, and beta = -2.02 +/- 0.15 (Castor C-Stat 420.5 for 
359 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(2.96 +/- 0.21)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux 
measured starting from T0+0.13 s in the 8-1000 keV band 
is 8.08 +/- 0.41 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
