TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4002
SUBJECT: GRB 050918 - A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/09/19 14:59:36 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), S. Shaw, N. Mowlavi, M. Beck, A. 
Neronov (ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

A 50 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 15:36:39 
UT on September 18 2005. Its coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  267.6096 [degrees] 
DEC: -25.4141 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

No prompt IBAS Alert has been issued for this burst because its significance
was below the threshold for automatic alert delivery.

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is 0.7 ph 
(8E-08 erg)/cmsq/s. Its fluence (20-200 keV, 50 s integration time) is 
2E-06 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
