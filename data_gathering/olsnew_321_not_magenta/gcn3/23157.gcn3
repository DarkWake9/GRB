A. D'Ai (IASF-PA) reports on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

Swift has performed further observations of the field of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 180806A (Malacaria et al., GCN 23095). 
An additional 4.2 ks of data were collected between 11.4 days 
and 12.0 days after the Fermi trigger.
Source 1, initially reported by Gibson et al. (GCN 23097)
as the likely X-ray counterpart, is no longer detected down to a 3-sigma 
upper limit of 1.0e-2 ct s^-1. Source 1 position was also consistent with an 
optically fading source (GCN 23091, 23092, 23094, 23096, 23098, 23101).
Source1 is therefore confirmed as the X-ray afterglow of GRB 180806A.
