Eleonora Troja (GSFC/UMD) report:

We observed the field of the Fermi/GBM GRB 210512.786 (trigger 642538568) with
the DDOTI wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra
San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) from 2021-05-13 04:27 to 06:59
UTC (from 9.5 to 12.1 hours after the trigger).

We observed a region covering aproximately 20 degrees in RA and 20 degrees in
declination (6 instrumental fields or about 400 square degrees) centered on the
final GBM position of 09:11:43.20 +14:09:36.0 J2000 and obtained 1680 seconds of
exposure per instrumental field in the w filter. We obtained AB photometry by
calibration against the APASS catalog.

We detect no likely candidate for the afterglow to our 10-sigma upper limits of
w = 19.65 to 20.00 (interquartile range).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
