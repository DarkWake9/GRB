S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The short hard GRB 061006 (Hurley et al., GCN 5702; Krimm et al., 
GCN5704; Swift trigger #232585 - Schady et al., GCN 5699)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=60326.896 s UT (16:45:26.896).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst shows
two main multipeaked pulses with a total duration of ~0.5 s.
The weak extended tail detected by BAT
(Krimm et al., GCN 5704) is marginally seen
in the Konus-Wind soft energy range G1 (23-80 keV).

The burst fluence is 3.57(-1.92, +0.31)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.028 s
2.13(-1.20, +0.41)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the most intense part integrated from T0 to T0+0.256 s
(this interval comprises ~2/3 of the burst total counts)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 0.62(-0.21, +0.18)
and Ep = 664(-144,  +227) keV (chi2 = 36/30 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
