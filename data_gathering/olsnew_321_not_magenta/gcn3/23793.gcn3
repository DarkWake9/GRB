Alexis Coleiro (APC) and Damien Dornic (CPPM)  report on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration:

Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis
of the recently reported single high-energy starting event (HESE) neutrino
IceCube-190124A (GCN 23785). The reconstructed origin was 44 degrees below
the horizon for ANTARES. 

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded within 3 degrees 
of the IceCube event coordinates during a +/- 1h time-window centered on 
the IceCube event time, and over which the potential source remained visible 
all time. A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded 
no detection (70% visibility). This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence 
level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 15 
GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 3.1 TeV - 3.6 PeV (the range corresponding 
to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 25 
GeV.cm^-2 (610 GeV - 316 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. 

ANTARES is the largest neutrino detector installed in the Mediterranean 
Sea, and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV 
energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos 
is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive 
sensitivity to this position in the sky.
