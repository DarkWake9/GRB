The long bright GRB 190519A (Swift-BAT trigger #904394: Ukwatta et al.,
GCN Circ. 24595, Lien et al., GCN Circ. 24606; Fermi GBM observation:
von Kienlin, GCN Circ. 24596) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 07:24:59.459 UTC on 19 May 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a broad multi-peaked pulse which starts
at T-4.0 sec and ends at ~T+24 sec, followed by a bright double-peaked
pulse, which starts at T+31.8 sec, peaks at 40.1 sec and ends
at T+45.3 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
42.8 +- 2.5 sec and 24.6 +- 3.5 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
