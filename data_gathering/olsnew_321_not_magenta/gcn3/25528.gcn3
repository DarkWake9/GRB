S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  E.Bozzo,
C.Ferrigno, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 18:48:30  UT of August 28, 2019.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=   251.9247 deg
DEC.=   -24.5498 deg

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.7    counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration  time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 7e-7
erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
