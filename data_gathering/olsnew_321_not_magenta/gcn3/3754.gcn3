S. Klose and C. Hoegner, Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg,

report:


Tautenburg observed the error box of GRB 050803 (Band et al. 2005,
GCN 3748; Racusin et al. 2005, GCN 3752) between 22:23 UT and 22:45 UT,
i.e., about 3 hrs after the burst. Several images were taken, mostly
in the I-band. Observations had to be finished after 22:45 UT because
of bad weather. We do not detect the afterglow candidate reported by
Berger et al. (2005, GCN 3753) down to about I=19.
