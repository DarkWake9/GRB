the REM/ROSS Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 060418 (Falcone et al. GCN 4966) with the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). Observations  
were performed automatically in the near infrared (J, H, K, z bands)  
soon after the GRB alert.

We find a single bright source in the XRT error circle, not visible  
in the 2MASS survey. Its H magnitude is about 11.25.

Further observations are still in progress.
