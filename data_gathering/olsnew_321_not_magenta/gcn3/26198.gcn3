Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191106A (trigger #933515)
(Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 26177).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 269.356, 46.046 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 57m 25.4s
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 02' 44.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 95%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows many overlapping pulses. The burst
emission
starts at ~T-1.3 s and ends at ~T+2.4 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.42 +- 0.35
sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.31 to T+2.38 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.89 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
