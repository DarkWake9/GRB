D. A. Kann, S. Klose & P. Ferrero (TLS Tautenburg) report:

We observed the location of the short burst GRB 060502B (Troja et al., GCN 5055) 
with the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope.

Observations were taken under bad observing conditions (airmass 1.95, twilight, 
moonlight). The observation consisted of a single 900 sec exposure in the R band 
taken at a mid-exposure time of 20060502.8356, 0.1101 days after the burst.

Due to the conditions, the image limit is shallow, with a 3 sigma limiting magnitude 
of 20.2. The Galaxy mentioned in GCN 5055 is clearly detected at a magnitude of R 
= 18.1 +/- 0.09 (measured vs. several surrounding USNO1.0B stars).

We detect a possible additional source to the southeast of the center of the galaxy 
(but within the PSF in our image), at RA = 18:35:45.90, Dec.= +52:37:33.20 (errors 
+/- 0.5"), which could possibly be a superposed faint afterglow, reminescent of 
GRBs 050709 or 050724. But there seems to be a source here also in the DSS R 
image, so this identification is very unsure.

Furthermore, we note that this galaxy is not included in the revised error circle 
(Troja et al., GCN 5059) any more, which would rule it out as a host galaxy 
altogether, unless it lies at low redshift and the progenitor has been ejected from the 
galaxy. Spectroscopy is encouraged.

No source is detected at all within the revised error circle. 

We are grateful to S. Melnikov for observing time.
