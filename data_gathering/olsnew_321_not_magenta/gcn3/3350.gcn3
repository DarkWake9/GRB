We observed the SWIFT burst (trigger = 116116) using 1-m Sampurnanand 
Telescope at ARIES, Naini Tal. The observations were carried out in V band 
(12*300sec). In the combined V band image (around May 02.654 UT, mean 
epoch of observations), we did not reveal any new source down to ~ 21.5 
mag, in comparison to a nearby star 09:30:06.62 +16:58:59.0 (V mag 15.992).
