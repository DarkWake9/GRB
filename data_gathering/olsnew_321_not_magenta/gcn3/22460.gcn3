We observed the field of the LAT GRB 180305A (Axelsson, et al., GCN 22457)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/03 6.11 to 2018/03 6.20 UTC
(17.28 to 19.45 hours after the burst), obtaining a total of 1.36 hours
exposure in the r and i bands.

At the position of source #2 found by Swift-XRT  (Evans, et al., GCN 
22459),
we detect a faint uncatalogued optical source. In comparison with the
USNO-B1 catalog, we obtain the following detections:

   r    = 21.95 +/- 0.12
   i    = 21.48 +/- 0.08

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
The source is located at RA,Dec = 03:18:28.33,+32:06:36.2 (J2000, +/-0.5").

Further observations to establish fading of the optical source are planned.

Mártir.
