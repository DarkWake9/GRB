A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 08:49:41.22 UT on 14 August 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090814C (trigger 271932583 / 090814368).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 332.5, DEC = 58.9 (J2000 degrees, 
equivalent to 22h 10m, 58d 54'), with an uncertainty 
of 5.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 61 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 0.25 s (8-1000 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is 
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.39 +/- 0.11 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 790 +/- 120 keV
(C-stat 500 for 479 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(6.6 +/- 0.4)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.64-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0 s in the 8-1000 keV band 
is 9.1 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
