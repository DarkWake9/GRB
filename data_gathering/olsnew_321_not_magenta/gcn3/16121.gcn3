We observed the field of GRB 140419A (Marshall, et al., GCN 16118) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/04 19.18 to 2014/04 19.20 UTC (9 to 40
minutes after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 0.15 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We detect the UVOT optical transient (see also, Zheng, et al., GCN 16116;
Guver et al., GCN 16120).  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we
obtain the following detections:

  r     16.22 +/- 0.01
  i     15.81 +/- 0.01
  Z     15.66 +/- 0.01
  Y     15.46 +/- 0.02
  J     15.31 +/- 0.01
  H     15.26 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source appears to be fading
approximately as t^(-1) in all of our bands during the observation.

Further observations are ongoing.  We thank the staff of the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.
