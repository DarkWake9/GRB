the Swift Team:

At 02:27:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060515 (trigger=210084).  Swift did not slew to the burst
because of the earth observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated
location is RA,Dec 127.287, +73.551 {08h 29m 09s, +73d 33' 03"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple overlapping
peaks with total duration of ~35 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. 

There will be no XRT or UVOT data products until Swift comes out of the 
constraint, at T+52 minutes.
