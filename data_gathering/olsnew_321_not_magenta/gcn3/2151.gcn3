H. Mito, S. Nishiura and Y. Urata on behalf of the Kiso GRB team:

" We have observed the field of GRB030418(=H2686) using the Kiso
observatory 1.05 m Schmidt telescope with near infrared camera KONIC.
The KONIC has circular field of view with 8.5'radius. We started to
observe the center region of HETE S/C_Update (Seq_Num 2) with J, H, Ks
band at 21 min after the burst. The afterglow reported Price et
al. (GCN2148) is out of these images.
 
 We re-pointed to the field including the afterglow position at 69 min
after the burst, . We obtained five J-band images with 300 s
exposures.

 We could not identify the afterglow with the limiting magnitude J ~
13 (3 sigma) at the 69 min after the burst. We estimated it comparison
with 2MASS J1054356-070118.

The more accurate analysis are in progress."
