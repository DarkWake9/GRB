report on behalf of the iPTF (intermediate Palomar Transient Factory) and
GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen)
collaborations:

We have continued tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G275404 (LVC, GCN
20738) and LIGO/Virgo G275697 (LVC, GCN 20763) using the Palomar 48-inch
Oschin telescope (P48). Including our first night of observations on
2017-03-01 UTC (GCN 20791) and a second night on 2017-03-02, we have
observed a total of 240 fields spanning 1747 square degrees. We estimate a
20% chance that these fields contain the true location of G275404 and a
25% chance that they containing the true location of G275697.

During preliminary sifting through candidate variable sources using image
subtraction by our IPAC (Masci et al. 2016) and NERSC (Cao et al. 2016)
pipelines, a total of 115 candidates were saved in the fields imaged.
Applying standard iPTF vetting procedures and removing transients with a
history of previous variability, we flagged 16 optical transient candidates
in the 90% localization contour of G275697, listed below, for further
follow-up.

We encourage spectroscopic classification of these candidates. In
particular, we highlight 17bub and 17buo as fast-evolving by more than 0.3
mag in the same night.

We are grateful to the Palomar crew (John Henning, Jeff Zolkower, Carolyn
Heffner, Jamey Eriksen, Nick Ganciu) for their hard work in reviving a
faulty declination encoder essential to collecting this dataset during the
last two days of iPTF survey operations.

Two known transients detected in early January also fall in the
localization region and were recovered with iPTF: PS17m (=iPTF17D) and
PS17n/Gaia17aan (=iPTF17G).

Positions are stated in the ICRS. Discovery times are noted in UTC hh:mm on
2017-03-02. Magnitudes are based on image subtraction and in the Mould R
filter, calibrated with respect to point sources in SDSS as described in
Ofek et al. 2012.

We caution that many candidates are outside the SDSS footprint and lack a
secure star/galaxy classification for the underlying source. We flag these
as "nuclear/stellar?". Where available, we provide machine-learning
probability scores on whether the underlying source is a galaxy/star (0/1)
(Miller et al. 2016).

We encourage spectroscopic classification of these candidates. In
particular, we highlight 17bub and 17buo as fast-evolving by more than 0.3
mag in the same night.

We are grateful to the Palomar crew (John Henning, Jeff Zolkower, Carolyn
Heffner, Jamey Eriksen, Nick Ganciu) for their hard work in reviving a
faulty declination encoder essential to collecting this dataset during the
last two days of iPTF survey operations.
