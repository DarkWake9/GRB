and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170514A (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 21094;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 04:18:42.056 UT) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 04:19:59.08 on 14 May 2017.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.  Because of a
problem in one of the ground alert processing script, the GCN notice
was not distributed automatically for this event.  Note that the CGBM
triggered at the 2nd bright burst episode which was ~1 min after the
initial peak.

The light curve of the SGM shows two separated peaks.  The initial peak,
which triggered Fermi-GBM and Konus-Wind, shows the emission around T-70 sec.
The 2nd peak starts from T-1 sec, peaks at T+0 sec and ends at T+10 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 7.8 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
