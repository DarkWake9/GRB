   We observed GRB 100902A (Sakamoto et al. GCN 11181) in J and K filters
  using UKIRT. The observation started at Sept. 04, 14:24:39 UT or roughly
  1.79 days after the BAT alert.
   The reduced images with non-optimal calibration frames do not show a clear
  sign of the afterglow candidate reported in Updike et al.
  (GCN 11209), although both the J and K images show a faint smudge at
  the reported location which may corresponds to the afterglow.
   The significance of the detection is only ~3 sigma (J ~ 20.8 mag,
  K ~ 19 mag in Vega), therefore it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion
  on detection or non-detection of the afterglow in our data. Further
  analysis of the UKIRT data is ongoing.
