J. Wang, C. Wu, J. S. Deng report:

We  observed  GRB 160225A (Siegel et al. GCN 19075)  with
80cm TNT telescope, located at Xinglong obervatory, China,
at 14:24:26 UT,  about 3.5 min after the burst.
The optical afterglow (Wiersema et al., GCN 19082) near the 
enhanced XRT errorbox (Goad et al., GCN 19082) was  detected 
in our white and R-band  images.  

The brightness of the optical afterglow  is about 17.58 mag 
at the mid time  of 3.67 min afer the burst,  calibrated by 
the USNO B1.0 star (RA=10:56:59.4  DEC=+53:40:45  R2=15.26mag).
 
We thank  excellent support of the Xinglong 80cm TNT staff, 
particularly YunPeng Wang.
