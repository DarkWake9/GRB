G. Vianello (Stanford), J. McEnery (NASA/GSFC), M. Ohno (Hiroshima U.),
J Racusin and E. Troja (CRESST) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detected emission from GRB 130325A
(GBM trigger 130325203/385879917).

This burst was detected over a 1300 s integration following the GBM 
trigger using
the P7SOURCE data class. This burst seems unusual because despite being 
within
the field of view of the LAT at the time of the GBM trigger, it was not 
detected by
the LAT during the prompt phase, which lasted 10 s (GCN 14329).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be RA, DEC 122.78, -18.90 
(J2000)
with an error radius of 0.25 deg (68% containment, statistical error 
only), this
was 51 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger and 
triggered an
autonomous repoint of the spacecraft at 04:52:31.48 UT.

A Swift ToO has been submitted.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Julie McEnery 
(julie.mcenery@nasa.gov).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an 
international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific 
institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
