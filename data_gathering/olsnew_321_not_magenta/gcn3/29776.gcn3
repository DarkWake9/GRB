S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB),
P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), N. J. Klingler (PSU), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 13:44:05 UT, and again 10 minutes later, the Swift BAT instrument
saw Sco X-1 and incorrectly produced triggers (triggers=1042031, 1042032). 

We are waiting for the full data from the ground pass to determine why 
BAT produced these triggers.  However, we do not believe
that this was due to any noteworthy activity from the source.
