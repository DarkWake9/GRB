The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:24:32 UT on 14 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220514A (trigger 674223877.638218 / 220514517).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 145.6, Dec = 13.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 42m, 13d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102.0 degrees.
