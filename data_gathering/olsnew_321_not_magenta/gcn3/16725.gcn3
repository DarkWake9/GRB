We observed the position of iPTF14eag (Singer et al., GCN 16668),
which is the optical afterglow of the Fermi GBM detected GRB 140808A
(Zhang, GCN 16669), at 15 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager
(AMI-LA). The observations started on 2014 August 18.61 to 18.78 UT,
corresponding to 10.6 days post-burst. We have detected the radio
counterpart (Corsi et al., GCN 16694) with a preliminary flux of
0.30 +/- 0.06 mJy.

An earlier observation conducted on 2014 August 12.61 to 12.78 UT,
corresponding to 4.6 days post-burst, yielded a marginal 3.8 sigma
detection of 0.15 +/- 0.04 mJy.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling
these observations.

These observations were made as part of the 4 PI SKY project.
