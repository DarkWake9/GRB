A.Volnova (SAI MSU),  E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of 
larger GRB follow up  collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 120224A (Saxton  et al., GCN 12980) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) on Feb. 24 between (UT) 
12:49:39 - 13:22:16  (mean time 8.44 hrs after burst trigger) in R filter 
under mean FWHM of 4.5" and at high airmass of  ~ 4 . In a combined image we 
do not detect the afterglow candidate (Elliott  et al., GCN 12988).  A 
photometry is based on the USNO-B1.0 star  USNO-B1.0 0722-0043384 
(02:43:36.48 -17:47:18.1) assuming R = 18.57:
