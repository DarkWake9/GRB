K. Hurley and D. Gotz, on behalf of the INTEGRAL AO-6 SGR
collaboration, report:

INTEGRAL carried out a ToO observation of SGR 0501+4516 from
2008-08-27T00:46 to 2008-08-29T13:36 (GCN 8131).  A very preliminary
analysis of the data indicates that IBIS/ISGRI detected the quiescent
X-ray emission at the 2 mCrab level between 20 and 40 keV.  At least
four bursts were detected, at

2008-08-27T16:25:14

2008-08-28T03:32:28

Data analysis is ongoing.

We would like to thank the INTEGRAL project for their support
and particularly Dominique Eckert and Volker Beckmann for the
quick-look analysis.
