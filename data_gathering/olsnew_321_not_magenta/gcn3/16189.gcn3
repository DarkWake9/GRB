report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:44:38.60 UT on 28 April 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140428B (trigger 420414281 / 140428906, IPN
triangulation: Golenetskii et al., GCN 16184).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 111 degrees.

This burst also triggered Konus-Wind (Pal'shin et al. GCN #16188).

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.32 s to T0+19 s is well fit by
a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.6 +/- 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 410 (-80, +134) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.0 +/- 1.0)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 17 +/- 2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
