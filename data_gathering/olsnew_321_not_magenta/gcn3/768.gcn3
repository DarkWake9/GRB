   S. Sinha, P. Sreekumar, K. Kasturirangan, on behalf of SROSS C-2
(INDIAN GRB EXPERIMENT) team report:

    SROSS C-2 observed this burst at 17776.64 s UT (this time may be off
by a few hundred ms). As observed by SROSS C-2, it had a duration (T90) of
13.9 secs, a 20-1024 keV fluence (not corrected for the sec (theta)
factor) equal to 1.6.10-5 +-8.7.10-6 ergs cm-2. The peak flux (256 ms) in
20-100 keV band is 4.25 photons cm-2 s-1 and the peak flux (256 ms) in
100-1024 kev band is 4.45 photons cm-2 sec-1. The hardness ratio for this
burst is equal to 0.27 +-0.08. Our hardness ratio is defined as
counts(100-1024 keV)/counts(20-100 kev).
    This message is quotable in publications.
