G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) and F. Nocentini (Frosinone, Italy) report:

On Sept 1.0599 2013 UT, we imaged the field around GRB 130831A (GCN 15139) 
remotely using the the 0.43m-f/6.8 robotic unit part of the Virtual
Telescope robotic facility in Italy, about 12 hours after the burst.

The source is visible on 300 seconds unfiltered CCD images
following coordinates (J2000.0):

R.A. = 23 54 29.89
Decl. +29 25 46.6

We also performed photometry, assuming R-mags from UCAC-4 for the stars in the
field, getting an estimate for the magnitude of 19.1 (CR).

Observations are ongoing.
