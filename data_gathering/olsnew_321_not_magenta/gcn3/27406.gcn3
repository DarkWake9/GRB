report on behalf of the SVOM Multi Messenger Astronomy and GWAC teams
(http://www.svom.fr/en/svom-mma-and-gwac-team):

We observed 10 (~1500 square deg) sky regions to cover the skymap of the
advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S200316bj (GCN # 27388), with SVOM/GWAC, at
Xinglong Observatory. SVOM/GWAC is equipped with two sets of wide angle
cameras:
- FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera, aperture = 3.5 cm),
- JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera, aperture = 18 cm).

SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and 16 JFOV cameras, working
in the unfiltered band. The observations are operated in time-series mode,
taking one exposure every 25 seconds (20s exposure + 5s readout). The
observed and processed regions enclosed an estimated 63% of the probability
of the advanced LIGO/Virgo skymap.

Images were taken between ~13.5 hours and ~17.5 hours after the GW trigger
time. The coordinates of the 10 sky regions observed and their observation
times and covered probability are listed below:

Weather conditions were clear during the observations. An average 3-sigma
limiting magnitude of 16 mag in the R band was obtained in the single
frames. No credible new source was detected by our online pipeline during
follow-up observations. A more detailed image analysis including
co-addition is ongoing with our offline pipeline to search for transient.
