D. N. Burrows (PSU), V. D'Elia (ASDC), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 00:34:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located the source GRO J1008-57 (trigger=626581). 
Swift did not slew to this source due to an Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 152.370, -58.275 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 09m 29s
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 16' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT lightcurve is not yet available for
time interval covering this 10-minute image trigger. 

A few kiloseconds of XRT/UVOT observation is planned. 

This source has been rising steadily for the past 10 days in
a bright apastron outburst (see Kreschmar et al. ATEL 6917).
