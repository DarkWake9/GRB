MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) observed
  GRB060425 error box (GRB_TIME is 2006-04-25 16:57:40 UT, IPN 
triangulation 
GCN5005) in survey mode at considerable zenit distances. The weather was 
good.

The first image was at 2006-04-26 18:17:03.46 UT,
1.05 days   after the GRB time. The last image was at 2006-04-26 
19:53:07.00 UT, 1.12 days   after the GRB time.
We have 54 images. 
The location of  our samples you can find at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB060425/GRB060425_ErrorBox_master.jpg

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).

There is 1 bright galaxies in error box NGC5476 (14 08 08.48 -06 05 31.2).


The robot not find SN-candidate in error box brighter then  17.5 (s/n=3).
The robot  find several asteroids in error box brighter then  17.5 (s/n=3) 
at error box:

  | number |     name      |            coord2000            | mag
  +--------+---------------+---------------------------------+------|
  |   1105 | Volland       |   14h 14m 10.3s , - 3d 15m 31s) | 17.5 |
  |    104 | Asta          | ( 14h 13m 18.7s , - 3d 57m 7s)  | 14.9 |
  |    111 | Euboea        | ( 14h  5m 56.8s , - 6d 59m 32s) | 14.2 |
  |   3652 | 2000 QZ79     | ( 14h  5m 52.7s , - 6d 50m 53s) | 17.4 |
  |   1403 | 1995 HR       | ( 14h  4m 5.1s , - 7d 59m 30s)  | 16.4 |

So as possible OT time decay may be about 1 day 
we plan additional observations.
