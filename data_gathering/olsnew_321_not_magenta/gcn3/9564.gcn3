We observed the field of GRB 090621A detected by Swift 
(trigger #355303; Curran et al., GCN #9540) with the 14-inch 
Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT) located at the Goddard Geophysical 
and Astronomical Observatory (http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).   
 
100 set of 30 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting 
from June 21 05:00:15 (UT) about 37.3 min after the trigger and 
stopped on June 21 05:56:22 (UT).  We do not detect the optical 
afterglow both in the individual images and the combined image 
inside the XRT position (Page et al., GCN #9543).  The estimated 
three sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure 
of 2850 sec; excluding five bad quality images) is ~17.9 mag using 
the USNO-B1 catalog.
