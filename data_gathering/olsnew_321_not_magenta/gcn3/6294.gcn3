E. Rol, N. Tanvir (U. of Leicester), A. Levan (U. of Warwick), L. Fuhrman 
(JAC), report for a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB070412 between 4.3 and 5.4 hours after the GRB 
trigger (Romano et al., GCNC 6273). At the position of the X-ray 
afterglow (Romano et al., GCNC 6282), we detect no source. We place the 
following 5-sigma limiting magnitudes at this position:

      J    20.7
      H    20.1
      K    19.8

The magnitudes are calibrated with respect to the 2MASS catalogue.
