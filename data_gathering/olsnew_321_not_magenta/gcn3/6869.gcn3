Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071008 (trigger #293587)
(Moretti, et al., GCN Circ. 6856).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 151.571, 44.303 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 10h 6m 17.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = 44d 18' 13" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 88%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a symmetrical peak starting at ~T-11 sec,
peaking at ~ T-1 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 18 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.0 to T+14.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.23 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-2.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
