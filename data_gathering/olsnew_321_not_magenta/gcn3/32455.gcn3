The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:15:42 UT on 10 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220810A (trigger 681866147.080906 / 220810969).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 309.4, Dec = 2.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 37m, 2d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
