We observed the position of GRB 140703A (GCN 16503) at 15 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on 2014 July 3.03 to 3.12 UT and July 4.22 to 4.38 UT, corresponding to <12 minutes and 1.19 days post-burst. No radio counterpart was detected during our first observation with a 3-sigma upper limit of 0.18 mJy. However, the radio counterpart (GCN 16515 and 16516) was detected during our second observation with a preliminary flux of 0.25 +/- 0.05 mJy.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
