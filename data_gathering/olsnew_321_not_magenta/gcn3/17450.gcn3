The long-duration GRB 150211A (Swift-BAT trigger #630714:
Starling et al., GCN 17434)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=42728.740 s UT (11:52:08.740).

The KW light curve shows a single multi-peaked emission episode
with a duration of ~13 s.
The emission is visible up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB150211_T42728/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of 2.4(-0.3,+0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2, and a 64-ms peak flux,
measured from T0+7.808 s, of 5.6(-0.7,+0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+16.128 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.62 (-0.20,+0.25),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.07 (-0.15,+0.10),
the peak energy Ep = 145 (-24,+30) keV,
chi2 = 114/97 dof.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
