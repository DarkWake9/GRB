A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) and V. Connaughton (UAH) report on behalf
of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:13:48 UT on 25 August 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and located
GRB 080825C (trigger 241366429 / 080825.593).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 232.2, Dec = -4.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 15h 29m, -4d 54'),
with an uncertainty of 1.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi
LAT boresight is 60 degrees.

This GRB has several peaks, with T90 (50-300 keV) = 22 s and
T50 (50-300 keV) = 12 s. The time-averaged spectrum (8-910 keV)
from T0 to T0+22.1 s is best fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 155 +/- 5 keV, alpha = -0.39 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.34 +/- 0.09.
The fluence (50-300 keV) is 2.4E-5 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; the final
results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
