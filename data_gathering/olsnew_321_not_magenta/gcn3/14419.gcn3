Using the data set from T-239 to T+303 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130420A (trigger #553977)
(Page et al., GCN 14406).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 196.118, 59.421 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  13h 04m 28.3s
    Dec(J2000) = +59d 25' 16.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a precursor beginning gradually at about
T-20 seconds and increasing irregularly to about T+100 seconds.  The main
emission had a FRED shape peaking at about T+110 seconds that was detectable
until about T+200 seconds.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 123.5 +- 13.1 sec (estimated
error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-19.7 to T+189.9 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.52 +- 0.25,
and Epeak of 33.2 +- 6.8 keV (chi squared 42.40 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-06 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+110.67 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
3.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 2.18 +- 0.05 (chi squared 66.06 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
