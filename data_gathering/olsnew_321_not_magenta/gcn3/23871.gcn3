X. Zhang (XAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 190202A (Lien et al., GCN 23830) using the 
Xinglong-2.16m equipped with the BFOSC camera. Observations were carried 
out starting at 17:26:32 UT on 2019-02-03, and 6x600s R-band frames were 
obtained.

The previously reported afterglow (e.g., Lien et al., GCN 23830; 
Novichonok et al., GCN 23833, Cucchiara, GCN 23839; Paek et al., GCN 
23841; Malesani et al., GCN 23842; Belkin et al., 23843; Moskvitin & 
Spiridonova, GCN 23844; Kumar et al., GCN 23853; Moskvitin et al., GCN 
23870) is very weakly detected in our stacked image, with R=22.0 +/- 0.4 
mag (at Tmid-T0 = 1.679 days post-burst), calibrated with nearby SDSS stars.
