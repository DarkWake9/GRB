We obtained spectra of the type Ic SN 2003L (IAUC 8048; GCN 1834) with
the MMT 6.5m telescope and the Blue Channel spectrograph on Jan 29.46
UT.  Two 600s exposures have a resolution of 0.6 nm and cover the
wavelength range 320 to 880 nm.  The supernova appears to be a normal
type Ic, similar to SN 1994I near maximum.  Expansion velocities
derived from the minima of the Ca II (rest 395.1 nm) and Na I D (rest
589.3 nm) lines are 12 000 km/s and 11 700 km/s, respectively.  At 4
days before maximum, SN 1994I had a velocity of 16 100 km/s for Ca II
and 11 100 for Na I.  As has been noted already (IAUC 8057), the
expansion velocity derived from the Si II (rest 635.5 nm) line of 5200
km/s is quite low, compared with 12 200 km/s for SN 1994I (at four
days before maximum).  The Si II line velocity was larger than 12 000
km/s for the first twenty days after explosion for SN 1998bw, well
above the value for SN 2003L.  The spectrum is available at
