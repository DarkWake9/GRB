E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:
 
"On June 1.11 UT we used the VLA at 8.46 GHz to observe the field centered
on the refined position provided by the SAX WFC (GCN 677).  There are no
obvious radio candidates brighter than 0.14 mJy (3.5 sigma) inside the
1.5' region centered on object #2, which was identified by the SAX NFI
(GCN 683). The 1.5' region centered on object #1 contains one bright
source which is also present in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS).  Further
observations are planned"
