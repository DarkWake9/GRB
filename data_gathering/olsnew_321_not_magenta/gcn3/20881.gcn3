Further to GCN20877, we report ATLAS observations of the skymap
(cWB_plus_LIB.fits) of G277583 (GCN 20860), with event time
2017-03-13 22:40:09.593 == 57825.94498372

We started observing at MJD=57826.54, 14hrs after the LIGO alert and
covered approximately 3600 sq degrees during the first 2 days. This
corresponds to a probability coverage of approximately 60% of the
cWB_plus_LIB.fits skymap (final number currently being refined, map
plot will be available on GraceDB). The limiting magnitude in the 30 sec
exposures in the orange filters is o ~ 18.7

We find the following four transients which are within the 90% contour
for which we have no previous detections. We also list, for reference 
old objects which are within the skymap but discovered before G277583

We apologise for the earlier release of ATLAS17cck in GCN 20877, which
is indeed minor planet Azalea (GCN 20879, Littlefield &
Garnavich). The object passed through our automated positional scatter
and ephemeris filters for removing known and unknown moving objects
and therefore did not trigger automatic rejection. This was due to an
artificial magnitude split introduced into our local version (at QUB)
of the minor planet database, with objects brighter than a threshold
maximum magnitude not being checked. The magnitude calculation was an 
oversimplification, and has been removed. Additional checks have also 
been introduced to prevent leakage of minor planets into the stationary list.
