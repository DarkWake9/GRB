J. Mao, B. Lun and J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:


We observed the field of GRB 141212A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 17158) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) 
station of Yunnan Observatory. Observations began from UT 12:58:57.9 12th, Dec., 2014 (about 45 mins after the trigger). 
We did not detect any optical source at XRT position down to a limit of R~22.0. In our single image, it is nearly impossible to
distinguish the sources clearly identified by Malesani et al. GCN 17170.   


We thank Dr. D., Malesani for his kind suggestion and discussion.  J. Mao apologizes for this very later GCN circular submission.
