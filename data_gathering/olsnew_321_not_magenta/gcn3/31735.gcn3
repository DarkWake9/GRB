The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:23:51 UT on 10 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220310C (trigger 668643836.426778 / 220310933).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 290.7, Dec = 43.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 22m, 43d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 27.0 degrees.
