report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 13:58:04 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220714B (trigger=1116221).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 47.072, -19.334 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 08m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = -19d 20' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~13 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 13:59:20.9 UT, 76.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 47.0803, -19.3269 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 08m 19.27s
   Dec(J2000) = -19d 19' 36.8"
with an uncertainty of 5.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 38 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.70e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of  56 seconds with the White filter
starting 121 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none
of the XRT position. Data from the list of sources generated
on-board are not available at this time. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.032. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Laha (sib.laha AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
