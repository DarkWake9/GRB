Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the GIT team:

We observed GRB 210610B detected by Swift-BAT (K. L. Page et al., GCN
#30170), with the 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We obtained a
60-sec exposure
in the r' filter. We clearly detected the afterglow in our image at
R.A.= 16:15:40.44
and DEC.= +14:23:56.65 with an uncertainty of ~0.67 arcsec. The photometric
results follow as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (start) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Filter | Magnitude (AB) |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

2459376.3429 | 0.37 | r' |  15.98 +/- 0.1 |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS (Flewelling et al., 2018)
and not corrected for Galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
