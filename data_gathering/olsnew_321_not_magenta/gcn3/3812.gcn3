D. C. Morris, D. N. Burrows, J. A. Kennea, J. L. Racusin (PSU), and N. 
Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050815 at 17:25:19 UT (Fox et al. 
2005, GCN 3811).  The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT 
position and the XRT began taking data at 17:26:28 UT (69 seconds after 
the BAT trigger). Due to a low source count rate, the XRT did not succeed 
in calculating an on-board centroid.  In the ground-processed data, we 
find a faint, uncataloged, fading X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 19:34:22.9
Dec(J2000) = +09:08:46.1

We identify this as the afterglow of the GRB.  We estimate an uncertainty 
of about 8 arcseconds radius (90% containment).  This source is located 
102 arcseconds from the BAT position in GCN 3811.
