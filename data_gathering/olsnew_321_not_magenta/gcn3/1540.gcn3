I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 71852
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
25 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.5E-06 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  7.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is  44 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  13 h 56 m 0.57 s    -44 o 43 '  36.34 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 13 h 56 m 18.65 s    -44 o 40 '  14.68 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 13 h 55 m  0.25 s    -44 o 47 '  55.19 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 13 h 57 m  0.56 s    -44 o 39 '  16.57 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 13 h 55 m 42.43 s    -44 o 46 '  57.92 " 

Based on the Konus ecliptic latitude determination, this error
box is the most likely of the two to be the correct one.  We
will confirm this as soon as possible.

This error box may be improved.

A map will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020910
