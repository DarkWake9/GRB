D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), J. Borkowski (CAMK, 
Torun), E. Bozzo, C.Ricci (ISDC, Versoix), on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

a long gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:56:25 UT of April 19

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:
RA: 187.4024 [degrees]
DEC: -63.017 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a 20-200 keV fluence of about 2e-7 erg/cm2 
and a peak flux of about 0.4 ph/cm2 s (1 s integration time)

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
