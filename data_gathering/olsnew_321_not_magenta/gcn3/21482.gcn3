AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G297595 (GCN #21474), we performed
an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different
timescales. On LIGO/VIRGO trigger time (T0=2017-08-14 10:30:43.527 UTC) the
GRID exposure has no coverage of the LIGO/VIRGO localization region (LR) due
to Earth occultation, from bayestar.fits.gz skymap in the GraceDB.

Data analysis in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed only at times
when the source region was not occulted by the Earth, from T0+500 to T0+600 sec,
when the AGILE-GRID exposure partially covered the LR (about 70% of it, observed
at off-axis angles between 0 and 42 deg).

Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible G297595 LR are from 3.1e-08 to 3.9e-08 erg cm^2 s^-1.

These ULs apply to a large fraction of the GRID-exposed LIGO LR.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
