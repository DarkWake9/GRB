Paul Kuin (UCL/MSSL) reports on behalf of the Swift UVOT Team:

We now have the light curve of GRB 201024A in the seven UVOT filters
from the start of our observations T0+495s until T0+100ks. After
a steep decline a rebrightening is seen starting around T0+1400s
which then peaks between 20 and 70 ks.
