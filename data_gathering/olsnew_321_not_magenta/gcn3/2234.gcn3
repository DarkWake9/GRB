Ulysses, RHESSI, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE-FREGATE observed this
GRB at 34342 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 10 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
7.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  5.0E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 151.655,  35.124 degrees, whose radius is 80.349 +/-  0.080
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
