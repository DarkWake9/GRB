TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5573
SUBJECT: GRB 060912A: Probable Host Galaxy

A.J. Levan, P. Jakobsson, R. Chapman (U. Hertfordshire), N. Tanvir, E.Rol
(U. Leicester) report for a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 050912A using the VLT and FORS1 in the VRI
bands beginning at Sept 14. 03:51 UT. At the location of the optical
afterglow given by Hurkett et al. (GCN Circ. 5558) we find an extended
source which we suggest is the host galaxy of GRB 060912A. The location
of the afterglow lies at the eastern end of this galaxy and the afterglow
may still contribute significantly at this time.

Images of the field can be found at

We thank the staff of the VLT for their assistance with these
observations.
