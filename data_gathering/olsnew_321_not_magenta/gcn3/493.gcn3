report:

We have imaged the BeppoSAX WFC error box for SAX J2303.2+0015
reported by Muller, et. al. (GCN 474) on the 1.3-m at MDM
with a nonstandard broad R filter.  We took four fifteen mintue 
exposures in bright moonlight.  Our field of view was 1024 x 1024 arc
seconds.

Comparing our images to the DSS/POSS-II plates, we have not found
any new object.  However, like Henden et. al. (GCN 490), our observations
did not go deeper than the DSS/POSS-II image.  They reached the same
magnitude.
