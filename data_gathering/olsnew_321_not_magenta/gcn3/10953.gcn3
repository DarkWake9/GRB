Guziy, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada) and A. de Ugarte Postigo
(INAF-OAB Brera), report:

"Following the detection of GRB 100713A by INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al.
GCNC 10951), we have obtained optical images with the 0.6m TELMA robotic
telescope at the BOOTES-2 station and with 1.5m telescope at the
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN), both located in Southern Spain.

At the position of the X-ray afterglow detected by SWIFT/XRT (D'Elia et
al. GCNC 10952) we do not detect any optical source down to I = 23 in
the co-added 1.5m OSN image (3600-s exposure at 21:07 UT, i.e. 6.5-hr
after the onset of the burst).

Due to the low Galactic extinction (Av = 0.2), this INTEGRAL GRB is very
suitable for follow up. Deeper observations (specially at near-IR
wavelengths) are encouraged".
