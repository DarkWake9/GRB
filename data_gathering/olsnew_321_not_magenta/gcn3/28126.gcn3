Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift trigger of GRB 200716C (Ukwatta et al., GCNC 28124), the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, automatically responded to this burst. Series images were taken started 22:58:53UT (72 s after trigger). In the first 10s image, the afterglow reported by UVOT (Ukwatta et al., GCNC 28124) and MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCNC 28125) is detected with magnitude of 16.8 (clear filter). Further observation are on going.

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA for their excellent support.
