K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 180824A was detected by
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT),
at about 36319 s UT (10:05:19).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
---------------------------------------------
Center:
   10.060 (00h 40m 14s) +56.619 (+56d 37' 09")
Corners:
  357.831 (23h 51m 19s) +60.118 (+60d 07' 04")
    6.353 (00h 25m 25s) +58.199 (+58d 11' 58")
   18.977 (01h 15m 55s) +52.272 (+52d 16' 18")
   13.317 (00h 53m 16s) +54.952 (+54d 57' 07")
---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 3.30 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 14.0 deg (the minimum one is 20.76 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 105 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
