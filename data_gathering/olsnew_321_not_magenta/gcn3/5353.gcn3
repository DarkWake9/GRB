SUBJECT: GRB 060719: correction to the coordinates reported in GCN 5347

D. Malesani reports:

It was noted an error in the coordinates of object #1 listed in GCN 
5347. The right ascension should be 01:13:43.08 rather than 01:13:43.44. 
To summarize, the correct coordinates of the two objects are (J2000):

  1: alpha = 01:13:43.08, delta = -48:22:58.2
  2: alpha = 01:13:43.68, delta = -48:22:51.3

The error is 0.3". The finding charts presented in GCN 5350 and posted 
at the URL http://www.sissa.it/~malesani/GRB/060719 are correct.

I apologize for any confusion this may have created, and thank Matteo 
Perri for pointing out this mistake.
