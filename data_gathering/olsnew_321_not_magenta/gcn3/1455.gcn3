E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, 
report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and MO-HEND observed this burst at 56970 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  20
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  8.3E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  6.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate preliminary 3 sigma error
boxes whose approximate areas are 200 sq. arcmin. each and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  12 h 09 m 04.48 s     83 o 06 '  44.26 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 12 h 03 m 32.15 s     83 o 16 '  13.61 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 12 h 17 m 21.75 s     83 o 01 '  37.33 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 12 h 00 m 33.98 s     83 o 11 '  12.68 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 12 h 14 m 19.83 s     82 o 56 '  58.10 " 


 ERROR BOX CENTER:  13 h 07 m 18.38 s       33 o 22 ' 54.25 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 13 h 06 m 48.49 s      33 o 10 '  44.30 "  
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 13 h 08 m 19.93 s      33 o 32 '  11.73 "     
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 13 h 06 m 16.69 s      33 o 13 '  39.21 "     
 ERROR BOX CORNER 8: 13 h 07 m 48.07 s      33 o 35 '  05.69 "  

These error boxes may be improved slightly, and we are seeking
auxiliary data which may allow us to distinguish between the two positions. 
Maps will be posted shortly at sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020714.
