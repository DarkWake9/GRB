The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:30:05.92 UT on 28 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220228A (trigger 667737010 / 220228438).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 321.0, Dec = -16.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 24m, -16d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 28.0 degrees.
