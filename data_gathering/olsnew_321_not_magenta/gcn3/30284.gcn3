Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:59:21.940 UTC on 19 June 2021
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1308182178/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows the bright initial pulse which starts
at T+3.5 sec and peaks at T+4.3 sec, followed by several weaker pulses
which end at T+85.4 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data
are 49.9 +- 1.8 sec and 14.4 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
