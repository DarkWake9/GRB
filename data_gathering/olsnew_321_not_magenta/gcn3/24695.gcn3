The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:10:12 UT on 31 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190531B (trigger 581026217.141598 / 190531840).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 20.2, Dec = -39.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 20m, -39d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 22.0 degrees.
