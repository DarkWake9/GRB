Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University) and Kenneth S.
Rumstay (Valdosta University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB
Follow-Up Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 071112C (GCN 7059, Perri et al.) with the
0.9m SARA telescope on Kitt Peak under decent weather conditions.  We
obtained 75 min of stacked exposures beginning 8 hours and 47 min after the
trigger.  We do not detect the afterglow (GCN 7059, Perri et al.) down
to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 21 in the stacked images (based on
calibration of 10 field stars to the USNO B1.0 catalog).
