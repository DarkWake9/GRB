Kazuhisa Mitsuda on behalf of Suzaku team reports:

A Suzaku ToO observation of the currently active AXP 1E 1547.0-5408
(Gronwall et al. 2009, GCN Circ., 8833) is scheduled. It was started
at 21:15:00 on January 28 2009 (UT) and will continue until 21:32:00
on 29 January 2008 (UT). All the Suzaku narrow field instruments
(XIS and HXD: 0.2-600 keV energy range) will be on during the observation.

The Suzaku observation will be coincident with the INTEGRAL observations
during the periods from 21:37:00 on January 28 2009 (UT) to 03:42:34 on
January 29 2009 (UT), and from 14:04:46 to 21:32:00 on January 29 2009 (UT).

Further follow-up observations at other wavelengths are encouraged.
