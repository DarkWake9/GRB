V. Mangano (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5.1 ks of XRT data for GRB 140103A (Mangano  et al.
GCN Circ. 15656),  from 172 s to 8.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 2.6 ks in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. 
A faint X-ray source at the level of 0.05 counts/s is detected during 
PC mode observation.
The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 232.08747, +37.75917 
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 15 28 20.99
Dec(J2000): +37 45 33.0

with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The 2.5 ks PC observation show a small scale flare and WT mode data are 
background dominated due to bright earth contamination and highly scattered.
At present time we cannot asses if the source is fading.
Further observations have been scheduled.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
