" We have observed the field of GRB050817 (Fox et al., GCN 3819) with
the 0.6m MOA telescope at Mt. John Astronomical Observatory using the
wide red and wide blue MOA filters. A combination of 3x300s red-band 
exposures with mean epoch at 14:18:00 UT (1.97 hours after the burst)
shows no new object in the error-box down to a limiting magnitude of
18.5. We note that there is a saturated difraction spike from a nearby
star crossing the field which hides aproximately 5% of it."
