Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170728B (trigger #765130)
(Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 21371).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 238.019, 70.111 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 52m 04.5s
  Dec(J2000) = +70d 06' 40.0"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 5%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a short multi-peaked structure from
~T-0.1 s to ~T+0.7 s, followed by some weak emission till ~T+50 s,
Fermi/GBM also reports emission till ~T+47 s (Stanbro et al., GCN Circ. 21383).
T90 (15-350 keV) is 47.7 +- 25.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum for the short pulse from T-0.1 to T+0.7 sec is
best fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon
index -1.10 +- 1.71, and Epeak of 82.0 +- 24.2 keV (chi squared 51.71 for
56 d.o.f.).  For this model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
6.2 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.21 +- 0.24 (chi squared 61.25 for 57 d.o.f.).

The time-averaged spectrum for the extended emission from T+0.7 to T+50.6 sec is
best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.25 +- 0.57.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
9.8 +- 3.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
