P. Butterworth, T. Cline, E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf
of the KONUS-WIND and NEAR GRB Teams, and K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses
GRB team, report:

Analysis of count rates in the north- and south-ecliptic facing KONUS-WIND
detectors clearly indicates that GRB991221 came from the first error
box cited in GCN 507:


  RA(2000)                  DEC(2000)               
14 h 43 m 59.59 s    -42 o 46 '  36.00 "     
14 h 44 m 12.73 s    -43 o 15 '  32.42 "     
14 h 43 m 10.52 s    -42 o 15 '  27.97 "     
14 h 43 m 25.10 s    -42 o 45 '  15.18 " 

This error box can be refined.
