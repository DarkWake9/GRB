The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:22:50 UT on 8 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190508A (trigger 579036175.400484 / 190508808).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 178.0, Dec = 23.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 51m, 23d 31'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 98.0 degrees.
