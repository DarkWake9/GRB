D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), C.E. Martinez-Vazquez 
(IAC-ULL), and P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration.

We observed again the optical counterpart of GRB 160117B (Sonbas et al., 
GCN 18875), using the NOT equipped with the AlFOSC camera. Our 
observation was carried out in the R band and was composed of 4x300 s 
exposures, with mean time January 19.10 UT (1.52 days after the GRB).

Compared to our previous observation (Malesani et al., GCN 18884), we 
find a decay slope alpha = 1.10 +- 0.05 (assuming a single power-law 
decay F propto t^-alpha). This decay is steeper than what reported at 
early time by Kruehler et al. (GCN 18878).
