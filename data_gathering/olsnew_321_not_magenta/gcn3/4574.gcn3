TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4574
SUBJECT: GRB 060124: Optical Observations at Tautenburg
DATE:    06/01/24 19:18:07 GMT
FROM:    Alexander Kann at TLS Tautenburg  <kann@tls-tautenburg.de>

D. A. Kann reports on behalf of the Tautenburg GRB Team:

I observed the field of Swift GRB 060124 (S. T. Holland et al., GCN 4570) with the 
Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope equipped with the 2k x 2k Schmidt CCD 
camera. Observations were obtained under good conditions and low airmass, 
beginning at 16:54:54 UT, i.e. one hour after the burst, in twilight. I obtained 6 x 180 
sec frames each in V, Rc and Ic.

A visual inspection of the Swift BAT error circle in comparison to the DSS 2 infrared 
plate reveals no obvious afterglow candidate to the following rough limits:

t (mid) UT	Filter	Limit

0.0427		Ic	> 17
0.0559		Ic	> 18
0.0587		Rc	> 20
0.0746 		V	> 20

These values are not corrected for the moderate Galactic extinction (E(B-V)=0.135).

Further analysis is in progress.
