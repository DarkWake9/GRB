 on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:08:26.68 UT on January 27 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst 
Monitor triggered and located 
GRB 150127B (trigger 444060509/150127589). The GBM on-ground 
location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with
the IPN Triangulation (K. Hurley et al., GCN 17360).  This burst
was also observed by Konus-Wind (S. Golenetskii et al., GCN 17363).

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 
80 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two peaks with a duration
(T90) of about 61 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+79 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 240 +/- 7 keV,
Alpha =-1.08 +/- 0.01 and Beta = -2.8 +/- 0.2.  The spectrum is also
well fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.09 +/- 0.01
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 250 +/- 5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.99 +/- 0.01)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1 s peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+55 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 19.8 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
