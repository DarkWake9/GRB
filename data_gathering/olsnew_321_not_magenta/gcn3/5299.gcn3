LaCluyze, J.A. Crain report:

SkyNet observed the localization of GRB 060708 (Moretti et al. GCN 5292)
with four of the 16" PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 15.4 hours after
the burst in UBgriz.

We were unable to see the afterglow down to 3-sigma limiting magnitudes of
z' > 19.0 at a mean time of 15.7 hours after the burst, i' > 19.2 at 18.6
hours, and r' > 19.3 at 15.7 hours.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned.
