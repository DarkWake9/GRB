We have performed two observations for GRB 171205A (V. Dâ€™Elia et al., GCN
Circ. 22177) centred on the optical afterglow position (L. Izzo et al.,
GCN Circ. 22180) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The
observations took place on 2020 April 12 (859 days post-burst) and 2020
May 7 (884 days post-burst) at several frequencies. We report the
detections and 3-sigma limits below:

Date (UTC) | Freq (GHz) | Peak Flux Density (micro-Jy/beam)
-----------------------------------------------------------
2020/04/12 | 2.1        | 708 +/- 253
2020/04/12 | 5.5        | 412 +/- 47
2020/04/12 | 9.0        | 252 +/- 27
2020/04/12 | 16.7       | 112 +/- 38
2020/04/12 | 21.2       | < 87
2020/05/07 | 2.1        | 816 +/- 287
2020/05/07 | 5.5        | 440 +/- 52
2020/05/07 | 9.0        | 237 +/- 26
2020/05/07 | 16.7       | 133 +/- 50
2020/05/07 | 21.2       | < 122

We thank CSIRO staff for supporting these observations during these
especially difficult times.
