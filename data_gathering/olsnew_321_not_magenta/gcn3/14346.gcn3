report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:24:04.05 UT on 27 March 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130327B (trigger 386065447 / 130327350), which was 
also detected by several instruments on-board the AGILE spacecraft 
(Del Monte et al. GCN 14344).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 214.9, DEC = -74.6 degrees, with an uncertainty
of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time was 47 degrees. The Fermi Observatory executed a 
maneuver following this trigger and tracked the burst location 
for the next 2.5 hours, subject to Earth-angle constraints.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple spikes on top of a gradual
rise and decay.  The main emission occurs between T0 and T0+35 seconds.
The total duration (T90) is about 62 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.8 s to T0+33 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.57 +/- 0.02 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 341 +/- 6.3 keV.

The spectrum also fits a Band function with Epeak = 334 +/- 7 keV,
alpha = -0.56 +/- 0.02, and beta = -3.4 +/- 0.4. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.176 +/- 0.057)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+32.4 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 12.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
