S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (SSDC),
J. A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report
on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 15:40:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR1806-20 (trigger=867343).  Swift did not slew to the source
because of an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 272.130, -20.376, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 08m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 22' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows two peaks
with a duration of about 2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 2018 October 16 at 21:16 UT. A Swift XRT/UVOT 
observation is planned for October 17th starting a 01:07 UT.
