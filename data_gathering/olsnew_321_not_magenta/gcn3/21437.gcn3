report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G296853 (GCN #21431), we performed
an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different
timescales. On LIGO trigger time (T0=2017-08-09 08:28:21.747 UTC) the GRID
exposure covered more than the 95% of the LIGO localization region, observed
at off-axis angles between 5 and 55 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0.
Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible G296853 localization region are reported below:

from 1.4e-06 to 6.0e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s
from 1.4e-07 to 5.6e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 20s
from 3.1e-08 to 8.4e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

These ULs apply to a large fraction of the GRID-exposed LIGO localization
region.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
