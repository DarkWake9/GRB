The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 16:07:46 UT on 14 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201214B (trigger 629654871.61686 / 201214672).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 206.2, Dec = 12.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 44m, 12d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
