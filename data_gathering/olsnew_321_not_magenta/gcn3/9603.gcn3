A. Paizis (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, (IASF- 
Milano), Wakiko Ishibashi, C. Ferrigno, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and  
J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team  
report:
A long gamma ray burst with a soft spectrum, and without any  
detectable signal above 40 keV has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ 
ISGRI data at 10:40:37 U.T. on July 2nd. Its duration is about 10 s  
and its refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.:      175.888 [degrees]
DEC.:    +11.501 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of   
about 0.15 ph/cmsq/s (1 s integration time) and a fluence over the same
energy range of about  1.5e-7 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
