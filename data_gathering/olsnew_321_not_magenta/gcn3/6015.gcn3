D. Malesani (NBI/DARK), A.O. Jaunsen (Univ. Oslo), and P.M. Vreeswijk 
(ESO), report:

We have analyzed the VLT acquisition images of the spectrum of GRB 
070110 (Jaunsen et al., GCN 6010). We provide the following astrometric 
position for the afterglow (J2000):

alpha = 00:03:39.27
delta = -52:58:26.9

with an error of 0.3". This is consistent with, and improves, the UVOT 
position (Krimm et al., GCN 6005). The object appears pointlike with a 
seeing of 0.75".

Based on instrumental zeropoints, we also report a magnitude R~21 on 
2006 Jan 11.030 UT (17.34 hr after the GRB). Such a bright magnitude is 
consistent with the slow decay reported by UVOT (Krimm et al., GCN 
report 26).
