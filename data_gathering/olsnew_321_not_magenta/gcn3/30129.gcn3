The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:55:58 UT on 5 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210605B (trigger 644597763.075646 / 210605622).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 15.1, Dec = -6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 00m, -6d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
