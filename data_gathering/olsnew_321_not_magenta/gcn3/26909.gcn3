The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 03:40:05 UT on 28 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200128A (trigger 601875610.774992 / 200128153).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 158.6, Dec = 41.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 34m, 41d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 19.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 129.0 degrees.
