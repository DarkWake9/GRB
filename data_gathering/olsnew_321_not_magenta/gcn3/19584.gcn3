Yuji Urata (NCU/ASIAA), Kuiyun Huang (NTNU), and Glen Petitpas (SMA/SAO)
report:

We observed the GRB 160623A afterglow (Mingo et al. GCN 19558, Butler
et al. 19567) with Submillimeter Array (SMA) on 2016/06/24 (1.1 day
after the Fermi-GBM trigger) and 2016/06/25 (2.2 day).  The quick look
image at the 1st epoch shows the bright (~15 mJy) submm afterglow. The
source also shows a gradual fading at the 2nd epoch (corresponding
decay index of ~-0.4).

Further observation is ongoing.

We thank the staff of SMA.
