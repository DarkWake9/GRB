Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 131202A (trigger #579982)
(Kocevski, et al., GCN Circ. 15559).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 344.005, -21.650 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  22h 56m 01.3s
    Dec(J2000) = -21d 38' 58.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 63%.  The mask-weighted light curve shows a pair of
overlapping peaks covering the period from T-10 to T+40 seconds.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 30.4 +- 10.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.62 to T+37.98 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.58 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.1 +- 1.0 x 10^-7erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
