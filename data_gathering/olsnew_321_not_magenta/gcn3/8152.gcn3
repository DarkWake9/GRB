We have triggered a ToO monitoring observation of SGR 0501+4516 with 
XMM-Newton. The planned observing windows are:

Start(UT)              Duration [s]

2008-08-29 06:48       26000
2008-08-31 09:45       22000
2008-09-02 09:45       22000
2008-09-06 13:20       27500


Simultaneous observations at all wavelengths are encouraged.

We are grateful to the XMM-Newton planning team for the efficiency in 
scheduling these observations, and to Norbert Schartel for approving our 
trigger.
