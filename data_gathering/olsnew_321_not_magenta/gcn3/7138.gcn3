Swift Team:

At 00:03:55 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071129 (trigger=297628).  Swift did not slew to this burst
because of the Sun observing constraint (23deg is less than 45 deg). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 220.090, -26.659, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 40m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 39' 31"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. 

There will be no XRT or UVOT observations of this burst
because of the Sun observing constraint. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. Pagani (pagani AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
