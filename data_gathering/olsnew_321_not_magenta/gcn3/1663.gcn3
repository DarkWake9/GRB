Konus and RHESSI also observed this event (GCN 1656).  The Konus
ecliptic latitude response limits the IPN annulus (RA, Decl=178.652,
+35.689 degrees, radius 73.524 +/- 0.111 degrees, 3 sigma) to the
portion in the south ecliptic hemisphere, that is, the portion between
RA, Decl = 92.5, +23.4 and 231.0, -18.5 degrees.  The 3-spacecraft
triangulation indicates that the most likely position along this
portion of the annulus is very roughly located at RA, Decl= 115.6, -7.8
degrees.

This error box may be improved slightly, but as the event was
not observed by MO, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
