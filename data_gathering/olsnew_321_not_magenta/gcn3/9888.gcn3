Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090904A (trigger #361830)
(Perri, et al., GCN Circ. 9879).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 100.855, 50.235 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 43m 25.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +50d 14' 06.9" 
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows low level emission starting at ~T-40 sec,
with a small peak at ~T+5 sec. Then there was a larger peak at ~T+50 sec,
and then the largest peak (FRED-like) starting at ~T+123 sec, peaking at
~T+128 sec.  Riding on that tail is a peak ~T+173.  The event is over
in the BAT energy band at ~T+240 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 122 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+29.3 to T+186.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.01 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+127.07 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
