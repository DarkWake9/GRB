MASTER-ICATE robotic very wide field cameras (FOV=2x384 square degrees,
D=72mm, f/1.2, 1 pix = 22 arcsec, http://observ.pereplet.ru) located
in Argentina (Observatorio Astronomico Felix Aguilar,
http://93.180.27.230:8080/) were imaging the sky area of MAXI/GSC GRB 
130102B (M. Higa et al., GCN 14130) before, during and after trigger time 
with 2 sec exposures without time gap. Elevation of center of GRB error 
box at the moment of MAXI/GSC trigger was 16 deg.

We have covered the whole interval of gamma-ray activity by KONUS-WIND 
(Golenetski et al., GCN 14135) which corresponds to T-20 sec to T+10 sec 
from MAXI/GSC trigger time.

We haven't found optical transient within MAXI/GSC error box on our 2-s
frames and on the coadded image made of 15 frames and total exposure of 30 
seconds. The 3-sigma upper limit (with the reference to V magnitudes from 
Tycho-2 catalog) has been about 10.0 mag on single images and 11.5 mag on 
coadded image.

The reduction of the whole data set is continuing.
