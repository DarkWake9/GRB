TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3967
SUBJECT: GRB050911: Swift-XRT position
DATE:    05/09/12 07:17:54 GMT
FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <kpa@star.le.ac.uk>

K. Page (U. Leicester), J. Kennea (PSU) and D. Burrows (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the first 3 orbits of ground data from GRB050911 (BAT
Trigger 154630). There is a previously uncatalogued X-ray source within
the BAT error circle at a position of

RA(J2000):   00:54:37.7
Dec(J2000): -38:50:57.7

with an uncertainty of 7.5 arcsec radius (90% containment). This is 107
arcsec from the BAT position reported in GCN 3961 (Page et al.)

Because of the limited amount of data, starting only 4.6 hours after the
trigger, it is not yet possible to confirm that this source is definitely
fading. However, it is the best candidate for the XRT afterglow.
