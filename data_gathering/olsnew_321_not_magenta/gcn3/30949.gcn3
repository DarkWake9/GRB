K. Hurley on behalf of the IPN team,

A.S. Kozyrev, D.V. Golovin, M.L. Litvak, I.G. Mitrofanov, and A.B. Sanin 
on behalf of the MGNS/BepiColombo team, and

J. Benkhoff on behalf of the BepiColombo team, report:

The ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission was launched on October 20, 2018 on a 
7.2-year journey to Mercury. After arrival in late 2025, the mission 
will spend a nominal one year in Mercury orbit. The mission consists of 
two spacecraft: the JAXA-provided Mio spacecraft for the thorough 
exploration of the environment, and the ESA-led Mercury Planetary 
Orbiter, MPO, for a comprehensive exploration of the planet itself, the 
interior, and its magnetic field. The MPO contains the Mercury Gamma-Ray 
and Neutron Spectrometer (MGNS) experiment [1, 2] consisting of a 3” 
diameter x 3” long CeBr3 scintillator, which also has a gamma-ray burst 
detection capability. During the cruise phase so far, MGNS operated for 
about 23 months, and has detected 38 confirmed gamma-ray bursts, 21 of 
which have been localized to annuli using data from HEND/Mars Odyssey, 
which is also part of the IPN since 2002. The verification of the 
localization accuracy of this method was based on gamma-ray bursts for 
which optical afterglows were detected. Reference [3] presents 5 
gamma-ray bursts as examples of these localizations.

MGNS is now the 34th experiment to be integrated into the interplanetary 
network (IPN) since 1977, which currently consists of Konus-Wind, Mars 
Odyssey, BepiColombo, Swift, INTEGRAL and AGILE. In this configuration, 
the IPN now has two interplanetary spacecraft, which will lead to more 
precise GRB localizations.
