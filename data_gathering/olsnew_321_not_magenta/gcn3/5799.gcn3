Christina C. Thoene, Daniele Malesani, Johan P. U. Fynbo (DARK Cosmology 
Centre), Christina Henriksen (DARK, NOT) and Dimitri Sharapov (NOT) 
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB061110 (GCNs 5797, 5798) on Nov. 
10 UT 19:35 (7.9h after the burst) with ALFOSC at the Nordic Optical 
Telescope on La Palma in the R and i bands.

We determined magnitudes of R=22.5 and i=21.6 using preliminary 
photometric zeropoints from the NOT webpages. Compared to the R-band 
magnitudes reported in GCNs 5797 and 5798, the afterglow has faded with 
a temporal decay index of beta~0.6.
