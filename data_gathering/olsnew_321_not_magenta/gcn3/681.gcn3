K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline and
E. Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and F. Frontera,
C. Guidorzi, and E. Montanari, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM
team, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed this burst (GCN #677).
Triangulation gives a preliminary annulus centered at RA(2000)=129.532,
Decl.(2000)=-33.150, with radius 26.478 +/- 0.111 degr. (3 sigma).
This annulus intersects the BeppoSAX WFC error circle at two points
(RA, Decl.=161.292, -34.013, and RA, Decl.=161.283, -33.950), reducing
its area by over a factor of two.  A map has been posted at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/000528.  This localization can be improved.

In addition, we call attention to the fact that the Ulysses data
clearly show a second episode of emission which follows the burst by
~600 seconds, with intensity approximately as great as that in the
burst itself.  It is possible that this is from the same source as the
burst; we are investigating whether the Konus or GRBM data can be used
to verify this.  The time history has been posted at the same site.
