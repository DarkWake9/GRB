Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210212A (trigger #1032183)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 29487).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 72.249, 7.215 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  04h 48m 59.7s 
  Dec(J2000) = +07d 12' 52.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve showed a broad peak with some underlying
structure.  It began around T-10 sec, peaked around T+5 sec and returned to
background by T+90 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 80.0 +- 35.8 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.51 to T+80.49 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.85 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.0 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.99 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
