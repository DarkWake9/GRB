K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, M. Feroci and
B. Preger, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, and T. Cline
and E. Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-WIND GRB team, report:

GRB000210 was observed by Ulysses, Konus, and the BeppoSAX
GRBM.  Triangulation gives an annulus centered at RA(2000)=
154.970, Decl.(2000)=-41.463, with radius 84.032 +/- 0.017
degrees.  This annulus intersects the BeppoSAX WFC error
circle (GCN 540) to form an ~3.7 sq. arcmin. error box
whose corners are given by:

          RA                DEC
1 h 59 m 05.32 s    -40 o 39 ' 19 "
1 h 59 m 12.96 s    -40 o 38 ' 11 "
1 h 59 m 07.35 s    -40 o 41 ' 32 "
1 h 59 m 23.85 s    -40 o 39 ' 05 "

A map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/000210.  This
triangulation is preliminary, and can be refined considerably.
