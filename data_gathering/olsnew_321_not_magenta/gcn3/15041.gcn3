Using the data set from T-239 to T+454 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130725B (trigger #564028)
(Swenson, et al., GCN Circ. 15029).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 214.233, -11.124 deg which is
     RA(J2000)  =  14h 16m 55.9s
     Dec(J2000) = -11d 07' 26.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED burst peaking at T+1 sec
and decaying to baseline by about T+8 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.0 +- 3.6
sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.3 to T+12.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.23 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
