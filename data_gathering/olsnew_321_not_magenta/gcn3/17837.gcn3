At about 15 minutes before the MAXI/GSC trigger on GRB 150518A
(Kawamuro, et al., GCN Circ. 17825; T0(MAXI)=21:42:14 UT)
Konus-Wind detected in the waiting mode a burst of high X-ray/soft
gamma-ray emission which had a duration of ~250 s.

Taking in account the proximity of this burst to the MAXI/GSC trigger
and consistency of the KW ecliptic latitude response with the position
of GRB 150518A we suggest this burst is the main part of GRB 150518A.
There is a hint of emission in the KW softest energy band (20-80 keV)
around T0(MAXI).

Due to a gap in the data during the main episode we cannot accurately
estimate the burst energetics.
