C. Malacaria (NASA-MSFC/USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

Swift-BAT detected GRB 200701A at 12:46:59 UT (Bernardini et al. 2020, GCN 28052). 
There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event.
An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard triggering 
threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no counterparts.

The GBM targeted search [1], the most sensitive, coherent search for GRB-like 
signals, was run from +/-30 s around BAT trigger time.
A transient source was identified whose most significant timescale according to 
the search is 8.192 s, with a log likelihood ratio of 39.

The location is consistent with that from Swift-BAT.
The spectrum is consistent with a "normal" GRB template 
(Band function with Epeak = 230 keV, alpha = -1.0, beta = -2.3).
