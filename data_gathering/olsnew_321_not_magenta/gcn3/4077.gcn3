Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlinks, we report
further analysis of Swift-BAT Trigger #158855 GRB 051008 (GCN 4069 & 4075).
An observing constraint and a slew to a pre-planned target
truncated the collection of BAT data on this burst at T+32 sec.
Because of this truncation and the observed ongoing emission
of the burst (at T+32 sec), the standard set of BAT numbers
for this burst are only lower limits.  T90 is >16 +- 1 sec.
Fitting a simple power law over the interval from T-24.9 to T+21.0 sec,
the photon index is 1.10 +/- 0.05 with a fluence
of >5.8 +/- 0.2 X 10^-6 erg/cm^2.  The peak flux in a 1-sec wide window
starting at T+2.9 sec is 5.5 +/- 0.4 ph/cm^2/sec (again we note that
we can not say if there was a higher peak flux beyond T+32 sec).
All values are in the 15-150 keV band at the 90% confidence level.
