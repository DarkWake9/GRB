A.S. Fruchter reports:

The field of GRB 140903A was observed on numerous occasions in multiple filters by the Pan STARRS survey.   An object is visible at the location reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 16770) in the r, i, z and y filter stacks.   The proximity of the object to a bright star makes accurate photometry extremely difficult.   However, in the i and z bands, where the object is most clearly visible against the scattered light from the nearby star, I estimate magnitudes of 20.0 +/- 0.2 in both filters.     This agrees well with that reported by Cenko et al in the r band., suggesting that this source is stable.
