B. E. Cobb (GWU) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 160410A
(GCN 19271, Gibson et al.) with a mid-exposure time of 20.7 hours
post-burst (2016-04-11 01:49 UT). Total summed exposure times
amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

No source is detected at the position of the optical
afterglow (e.g. GCN 19271, Gibson et al.; GCN 19272, Yates
et al.) to approximate limiting magnitudes of I > 20.3 and J > 17.5.
Magnitudes are calibrated using USNO-B1.0 stars in I,
and 2MASS stars in J.
