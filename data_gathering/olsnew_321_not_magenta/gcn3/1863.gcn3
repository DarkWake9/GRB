Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus and Ulysses GRB teams, report:

Konus and RHESSI observed this burst at 39632 s.  Its duration
was ~0.1 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered at RA, Decl (2000)= 132.776, +22.248 degrees, with
radius 59.979 +/- 1.914 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the
Konus ecliptic latitude response restricts the arrival direction
to the south ecliptic hemisphere, that is, to those portions of
the annulus below RA, Dec =69.5, +22.1 degrees, and
RA, Dec= 186.5, -2.8 degrees. 

As this annulus does not include any of the known soft gamma repeaters,
but does intersect the galactic plane, this burst is likely,
although not certain, to be a short/hard GRB.

It will not be possible to derive a small error box for
this burst.
