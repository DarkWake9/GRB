E. A. Hoversten (PSU) and J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf  
of the Swift UVOT team:

    The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080310 (trigger 305288)  
starting 99 seconds after the BAT trigger (Cummings, et al., GCN  
Circ. 7382) starting with a 100s finding chart exposure in the white  
filter.  A bright afterglow was clearly detected in the initial white  
and V band exposures.

Further analysis shows that a fading source is detected at the XRT  
position in the U, B, V, and white filter images.  The source is  
still detectable in these filters around 7000 seconds after the  
burst.  The white and U band images show a brightening of the source  
reaching a peak after 1 ks after the burst before fading smoothly.   
The B and V images show a more smooth decay.

The afterglow is not detected in the UVW1 and UVM2 filters and is  
weakly detected in the UVW1 filter.  This is consistent with the  
measured redshift of 2.42 (Prochaska, et al., GCN Circ. 7388).

The detections and 3-sigma upper limits in the UVOT photometric  
system (Poole, et al. 2008, MNRAS 383, 627) are given in the  
following table.  The white and optical magnitudes are individual  
exposures while the UV magnitudes are from co-added images.

No correction has been made for the expected Galactic extinction of E 
(B-V) of 0.04 mag in the direction of the burst (Schlegel, et al. 1998).
