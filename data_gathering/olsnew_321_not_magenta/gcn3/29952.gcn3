We observed the field of ZTF21aayokph (AT2021lfa) reported by (Yao,
Perley, & Ho, GCN Circ. 29938) using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI)
on the 4.3m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ.
Observations started on May 6, 2021 at 05:39:57 UT (about 48 hours after
the initial detection by ZTF) in the SDSS r-band.

We detect the source with magnitude r ~ 21.63 +/- 0.02 AB mag.
Compared to the magnitude determined by Butler et al. (GCN Circ.
29941) the transient faded with temporal index alpha ~ 1.5
in the r-band.

Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and are not
corrected for Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance
with these observations.
