(MRAO) report on behalf of the 4 Pi Sky / AMI team:

"We observed the BAT position of GRB 130216A (Melandri et al., GCN 14223;
Barthelmy et al., GCN 14229) with the AMI Large Array at 15 GHz on
February 16, for one hour starting at 22:28 UT, i.e. 13 minutes after
the burst. The beam FWHM covers the entire BAT error circle.
We detect a source at >10 sigma significance consistent with the
location of the BAT trigger. Further observations are planned to
confirm if this is indeed very early radio emission from GRB 130216A.

These observations were triggered via the system described in
Staley et. al (2013, MNRAS, 428, 3114)."
