The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:55:24 UT on 7 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210807C (trigger 650069729.307352 / 210807955).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 147.6, Dec = -51.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 50m, -51d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
