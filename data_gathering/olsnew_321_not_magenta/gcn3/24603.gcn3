In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190519bj at T0 = 2019-05-19 15:35:44 (UT),
a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found no
event candidates within a time interval covering +/- 100 sec from the LIGO-Virgo T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S190519bj 90% c.l.
localization region (almost 70% of the given GW contour), from a minimum of
1.16E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 1.90E-06 erg cm^-2  (assuming as spectral
model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
