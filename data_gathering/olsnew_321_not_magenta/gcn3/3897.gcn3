SUBJECT: GRB050824: Maidanak optical limits

D. Sharapov,  G. Abdullaeva, M. Ibrahimov (MAO), A.Pozanenko (IKI),
V.Rumyantsev (CrAO) on  behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the field of OT (GCNs  3865, 3868, 3880) of GRB050824 (GCN
3866)  with 1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory. A set of  R
images were taken between (UT) 21:27 - 22:01, on August 25.

We do not detect the OT  in a stacked image.  Based on USNO A2.0 nearby
stars  we estimate limiting magnitude (3 sigma) of the stacked image (6x300
s) as R ~ 22.0.  Detailed calibration of the stacked image is underway.
