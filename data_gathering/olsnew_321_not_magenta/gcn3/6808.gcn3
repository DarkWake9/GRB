Swift Team:

At 21:04:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070920B (trigger=291728). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 0.144, -34.819 which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 00m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = -34d 49' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 35 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled.  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (racusin AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
