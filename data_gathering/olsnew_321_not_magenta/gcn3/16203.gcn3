Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:30:20.11 UT on 02 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140502A (trigger 420712223 / 140502354),
which was also detected by Swift/BAT and XRT (Swenson et al. 2014, GCN 16202).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90) 
of about 20 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.048 s 
to T0+6.144 s is well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.7 +/- 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 298 +/- 71 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.6 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.448 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
