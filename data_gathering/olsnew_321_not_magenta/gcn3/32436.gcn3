S. Dichiara (PSU), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J. D.
Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P.
Beardmore (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T. Sbarrato
(INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Swift-BAT-detected burst GRB 220730A (Dichiara et al. GCN Circ. 32431).
The observations now extend from T0+119 s to T0+124.8 ks. 

Of the sources reported by D'Ai et al. (GCN Circ. 32434), "Source 5" is
fading with >3-sigma significance and is believed to be the afterglow. 
The position of this source is RA, Dec=225.0143, -69.4959 which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 15:00:3.43
Dec(J2000): -69:29:45.4

with an uncertainty of 6.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 9.3 arcsec from the Swift-BAT position.  

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01118357.
