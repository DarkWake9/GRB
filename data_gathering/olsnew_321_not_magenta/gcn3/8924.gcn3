team, report:

The bright long GRB 090301A (Swift-BAT trigger #344582: Vetere et al., 
GCN 8920; Fenimore et al., GCN 8923) triggered Konus-Wind at 
T0=24949.694 s UT (06:55:49.694).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a duration of
~50 s, followed by a weak tail marginally seen up to ~T0+200 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.13 +/- 0.08)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+25.408 s
of (1.51 +/- 0.23)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+44.032 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 5 MeV
range) by GRB (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.87 +/- 0.05,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.65(-0.47, +0.25),
the peak energy Ep = 429(-32, +34) keV (chi2 = 77.5/76 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
