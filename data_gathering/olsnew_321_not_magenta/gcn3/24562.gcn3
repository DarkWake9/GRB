O.J. Roberts (USRA/NASA-MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:33:03.14 UT on the 15th May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 190515A (trigger 579587588 / 190515190), which was
also detected by the LAT (Kocevski et al. 2019, GCN 24560)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a bright short spike with a duration (T90)
of about 0.5 s (10-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-0.26 s to T0+0.38 s is best fit by a power law function with
an exponential high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is
-0.4 +/- 0.2 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak,
is 960 +/- 251 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.233 +/- 0.070)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-msec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.2 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2."

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
