The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:14:04 UT on 25 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211225C (trigger 662148849.44199 / 211225760).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 339.9, Dec = -59.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 39m, -59d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 36.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 151.0 degrees.
