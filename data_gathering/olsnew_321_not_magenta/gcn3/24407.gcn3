report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the trigger time
(T0=2019-05-04 18:25:18.39 UTC) of this high-energy neutrino event (GCN 24392), 
which was monitored without any occultation by 
the Earth. Within T0 Â± 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales(1 s, 10 s) coming from the position of this 
neutrino event, the 5-sigma upper-limits fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy)
are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1s: 4.9e-08 erg cm^-2   
10s: 3.0e-07 erg cm^-2 

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1s: 6.9e-08 erg cm^-2   
10s: 5.0e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1s: 1.8e-07 erg cm^-2  
10s: 1.8e-06 erg cm^-2 

Further analysis will be reported in the following circulars.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
