Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120722A (trigger #528195)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 13499).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 230.489, 13.249 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 21m 57.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 14' 56.8" 
with an uncertainty of 3.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 19%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a couple overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+23 sec, and ending at ~T+50 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 42.4 +- 10.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.3 to T+47.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.90 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+24.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
