We observed 52 sky regions (total: 7800 square degrees with overlaps)
to cover the skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S190630ag,
with SVOM/GWAC, at Xinglong Observatory equipped with a set of two
types of wide angle cameras: FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 3.5 cm) and JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 18 cm). SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and
16 JFOV cameras, working with unfiltered band. The observations are
operated in time-series mode, taking one exposure every 15 seconds
(10s exposure + 5s readout). 

The observations were made during two nights (2019.06.30-2019.07.01).
During the night of 2019.06.30, GWAC worked in survey mode. The survey
area covered over 5000 square degrees, including 15.2 % of the 90% c.l. GW error box. 
The images were taken between ~5 hours and ~1 hour before the event trigger
time, and no electromagnetic precursor has been found down to a 15.5
mag 3 sigma limit in the R band.

During the night of 2019.07.01, the GWAC worked on follow-up mode.
Over 5500 square degrees were observed. We estimate a 7.2% prior 
probability that the 19 observed and processed regions contain 
the true location of the source.

The coordinates of the 19 sky regions and observation times are listed below:

The weather conditions were good during the observations. A 3 sigma 
limiting magnitude of about 15.5 mag in R band was obtained in the single 
frames. No credible new source is detected by our online pipeline during follow-up observations.
A more detailed image analysis including co-addition is ongoing with
our offline pipeline to search for transient candidates.
