report on behalf of the Kanazawa GRB team:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060801 (J. L. Racusin et al. GCN 5378)
in R band with 0.3m telescope at Kanazawa Japan.
The automated system took the first image at 300 s after the trigger
(under poor conditions).  Compared with the USNO-A2.0 catalog, no new
source was detected brighter than the limiting magnitude of R>15.9 mag
in the XRT error circle.  Further analysis is in progress.
