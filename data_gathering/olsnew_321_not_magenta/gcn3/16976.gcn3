larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 141020A  (Cenko et al., GCN 
16928) with with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy). We 
obtained several images on Oct. 23 starting on (UT) 14:25:05.  At the 
position of optical afterglow (Cenko et al., GCN 16928; Kuin et al., GCN 
16932; Mazaeva et al., GCN 16943) we do not detect any object down to 
R=23.0. Preliminary photometry is following:
