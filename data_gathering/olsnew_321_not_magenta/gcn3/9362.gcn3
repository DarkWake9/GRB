On May 15.28 UT we observed the field of the short GRB 090515 (Beardmore 
at al,
GCN 9356) with Gemini GMOS-N. We took a sequence of 6 images of 300 sec
each in R band.

No clear afterglow candidate has been found in the XRT error circle (GCN 
9356)
at the limiting magnitude of R ~ 25.4.

We also note the presence of a galaxy on the north edge of the XRT error 
circle,
at the following position:

RA: 10:56:36.46
Dec: +14:26:31.91

with a 0.3 arcsecond error in both coordinates.
The magnitude of this galaxy is R = 22.90 +- 0.18 (calibrated using the 
SDSS star
at RA = 10:56:35.74 , Dec = 14:26:49.6).


We thank the Gemini staff for performing these observations.
