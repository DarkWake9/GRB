F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3552 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =     03:08:20.18 =  47.08409
  DEC(J2000) = -19:19:45.3  = -19.32925
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc sec. This position is 1.5
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 32395). The estimated magnitude is
16.52 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.032.
