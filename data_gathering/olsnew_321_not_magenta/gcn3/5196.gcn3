behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:32:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060602 (trigger=213180).  Swift did not slew to the burst
because of the Moon constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA,Dec 149.576, +0.323 {09h 58m 18s, +00d 19' 23"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve has a peak starting at
T+0 sec and ending at ~T+15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

This burst will not become visible to Swift NFIs until June 4th, 08:46UT.
