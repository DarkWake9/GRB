S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo,and 
J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 05:05:15 UT of July 10, 2017. Its significance was 
below the threshold for automatic alert delivery

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 352.2526 deg
DEC.= +51.2935 deg

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.3 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 4x10e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
