On 2017-11-06 18:39:39 UTC the IceCube detector observed an energetic neutrino event with a high probability of being astrophysical in origin (GCN 22105). The best-fit position of the neutrino provided by IceCube is RA2000 = 340.0 (-0.5/+0.5) deg and Dec2000 = 7.4 (-0.25/+0.35) deg, with uncertainties quoted at the 90% confidence level.

Pointed Target-of-Opportunity observations of the neutrino location with INTEGRAL were obtained between 2017-11-16 19:07 UTC and 2017-11-17 08:28 UTC for a total observation time of 45 ks. A preliminary analysis of the data did not reveal any new sources in the combined ISGRI or JEM-X mosaics. The typical 3-sigma sensitivity reached for the position of IceCube-171106A was 1.9 mCrab (2.9e-11 erg/cm2/s) in JEM-X 3-10 keV mosaic and 3.5 mCrab (2.7e-11 erg/cm2/s) in 20-40 keV ISGRI mosaic. INTEGRAL observations of the neutrino position at the time of the trigger were reported in GCN 22109. 

We thank the INTEGRAL Science Operations Centre (ESA/ESAC, Madrid, Spain) and the Mission Operations Centre (ESA/ESOC, Darmstadt, Germany) for their prompt scheduling of these observations.
