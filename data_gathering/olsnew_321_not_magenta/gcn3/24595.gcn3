T. N. Ukwatta (LANL), E. Ambrosi (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (SSDC),
C. Gronwall (PSU), J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 07:25:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190519A (trigger=904394).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 114.764, -38.824 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 39m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 49' 26"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec. In addition, there might be
a weaker pulse that starts at ~ T-50 s. The peak count rate
was ~5500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:27:04.3 UT, 85.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 114.7673,
-38.8052 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 39m 04.14s
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 48' 18.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 68 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (4.31 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.6
(+2.17/-1.96) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.35e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
150 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. 
Results from the list of sources generated on-board are not available at this
time. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.42.
