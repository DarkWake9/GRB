report:

"Several images of the HETE-II error box for the GRB
030913 (Suzuki et al., GCNC 2383) were obtained right
after the sunset as the automatic response to the GRB
alert by the BOOTES-2 instruments in Southern Spain.
Images were acquired by both the wide-field CCD (35
x 35 deg FOV) and the narrow-field CCD attached to the
0.3-m telescope (30' FOV) starting on Sep 13.797 UT
(2-h after the event). Limiting magnitudes of the co-
added images for the following 10-min are 12 (I-band)
and 17.5 (unfiltered), which cover 100% and 70% of the
refined HETE-II error box (Donaghy et al. GCNC 2388)
respectively. None of them reveals any new (or strongly
variable) source, in agreement with the results obtained
by Torii (GCNC 2381), Lipunov et al. (GCNC 2385) and
Klotz et al. (GCNC 2386). This is the first event followed
up at the BOOTES-2 station. Images are posted at 
http://laeff.inta.es/BOOTES/ing/results/grb030913.htm".
