A.S. Moskvitin, V.N. Komarova, V.V. Sokolov, T.N. Sokolova (SAO RAS),
A.F. Valeev (SAO RAS, Kazan Federal Uni.) report on behalf of a larger
GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the GRB 140606B / iPTF 14bfu field (Singer et al.,
GCNC 16360) with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 telescope of SAO RAS on June 19/20,
21:26:29 - 00:22:32 UT (13.8 days since the Fermi/GBM trigger).
25 images in Rc band with the total exposure 7500 seconds were obtained.
Near the GRB OT location we clearly detect an object with the brightness
R = 22.1 +/- 0.2, measured against nearby USNO-B1 stars.

This magnitude agrees with the value measured by Volnova et al.
on June 8 (GCNC 16403). Such stability supports an idea that it may be
the host galaxy of GRB 140606B (Perley et al., GCNC 16365).
