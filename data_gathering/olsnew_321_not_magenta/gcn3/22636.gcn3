"At 08:03:27.79 UT on 10 April 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180410A (trigger 545040212 / 180410336),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Gropp et al. 2018, GCN 22620, Lien et al., GCN 22628).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 108 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of an initial peak followed by a weaker
emission episode with a duration (T90) of about 100 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3 s to T0+47 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with index -1.53 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.1 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.51 +/- 0.27 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
