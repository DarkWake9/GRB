Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

“At 19:46:32.24 UT on February 19 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located an extremely bright long GRB 140219A (trigger 414531995/140219824),
which was also detected by INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Suzaku (WAM), Mars Odyssey (HEND) and
MESSENGER (GRNS) (Holland et al., GCN 15825). The GBM on-ground location is consistent 
with IPN error box.

The GRB position was occulted by the Earth during the brightest period of emission and 
only the weaker tail emission was observed by GBM. Using the available data we find that 
the GBM light curve consists of a multiple-peak structure with a duration of about 80 s
(50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to T0+78 s is well fit with
a power law  function with an exponential high energy cutoff, which is parameterized
as Epeak = 194 +/- 61 keV,  alpha = -1.3 +/- 0.1. The event fluence (10-1000 keV)
in this time interval is (4.9 +/- 0.6)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 3.2 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will
be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
