E. Berger (Carnegie), S. Gonzalez, and W. Krzeminski (LCO) report:

"We observed the XRT position (GCN 5695) of GRB 061004 (GCN 5694) using 
the du Pont 100-inch telescope in K-band and the Swope 40-inch telescope 
in r-band.  A total of 1215 sec and 1200 sec were obtained in each filter, 
respectively, starting on 2006 Oct 5.313 and Oct 5.338 UT.  We do not 
detect any sources within the XRT error circle to a 3-sigma limit of 
K=18.9 mag and r=22.0 mag."
