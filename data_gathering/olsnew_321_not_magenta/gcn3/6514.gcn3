D. Grupe (PSU), P. Evans (U Leicester), report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Swift XRT started observing the afterglow of GRB 070612B (GCN circ 6511) 
at 07:15:15.59, 3239s after the BAT trigger. We found a bright, 
uncatalogued, possibly fading  source in the XRT data.



Using 272 of prompt downlinked data, we find a position RA, Dec 
261.7267, -8.7524 which is
   RA(J2000)  = 17 26 54.4
   Dec(J2000) = -08 45 08.7
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
Further analysis of the data will be performed with the ground-processed 
data.
