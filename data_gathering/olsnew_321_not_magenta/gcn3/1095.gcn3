HETE Trigger #1760 (GRB 010920B?): new optical source = asteroid

J. S. Bloom, D. Reichart, D. W. Fox, P. D. Nicholson, C. Dumas, S. R.
Kulkarni, P. A. Price, R. A. Simcoe report on behalf of the larger
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"A follow-up image to those reported in GCN #1094 obtained at Palomar
shows that the 'new optical source' moved by ~29 arcsec in 66 min,
primarily westwardly.  Given the apparent magnitude, location near the
ecliptic, and high proper motion, the source is likely an unrelated Main
Belt asteroid."
