Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180314B (trigger #814305)
(D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ. 22491).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 297.855, 23.634 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  19h 51m 25.3s
  Dec(J2000) = +23d 38' 04.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 66%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~ T-50 sec and ends at ~ T+35 s. The main peak occurs at ~ T0.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 73.0 +- 9.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-47.6 to T+34.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.41 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.6 +- 1.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.57 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
