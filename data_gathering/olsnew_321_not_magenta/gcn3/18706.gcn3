and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 151212B (Fermi-GBM trigger #471576728) triggered the CALET 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 01:32:04.68 UT on 12 December 2015.  The clear 
burst signal was detected by the Soft Gamma-ray Monitor (SGM; 30 keV - 20 MeV) which 
is a scintillation detector utilized a BGO crystal.  Due to a large incident angle 
of the event, no signal was detected by the Hard X-ray Monitor (HXM; 7 keV - 1 MeV) 
which is a scintillation detector composed of a LaBr3(Ce) crystal.

The light curve of the SGM shows the main peak starting from T0, peaking 
at T0+1 sec and ending at T0+4 sec.   The T90 duration measured by the SGM 
data is 3.5 +- 0.5  sec (40-460 keV).  

Currently, CALET is in the commissioning phase.  Further information about CALET and 
CGBM can be found at http://calet.jp/en/ and http://www.en.yoshida-agu.net/research/calet-gbm
