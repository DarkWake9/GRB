V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IITB), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed clear detection of GRB 170208A (Swift detection: A. Cholden-Brown et al., GCN Circ. 20631) in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple peaks structure with maximum counts at 18:11:16.0 UT peak, which coincides with Swift trigger. The measured peak count rate is 316.9 counts/sec above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1106.2 counts. The local mean background count rate was 425.1 counts/sec. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 10.7 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
