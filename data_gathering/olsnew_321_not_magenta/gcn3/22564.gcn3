We observed the field of GRB 180329B (Racusin et al., GCN 22558) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/03 30.13 to 2018/03 30.18
UTC (12.92 to 14.22 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
0.96 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
USNO-B1 catalog, we obtain the following detections:

 r	= 20.29 +/- 0.09
 i	= 20.32 +/- 0.10

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source has faded in r at the 4-sigma level when compared to the
earlier NOT observation of Perley et al. (GCN 22562).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
