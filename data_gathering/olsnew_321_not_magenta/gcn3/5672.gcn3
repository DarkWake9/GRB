Christina C. Thoene (DARK Cosmology Centre), Christina Henriksen (DARK,
NOT) and Klaas Wiersema (Univ. of Amsterdam) report:

We observed the field of GRB060807 on Sep. 20 and 22 with ALFOSC at the
NOT on La Palma in V, R and i.
At the position of the afterglow (GCN 5420), we detect an extended source,
clearly visible in stacked images from all three filters (8x600s in V and
R, 9x600s in I). We therefore conclude that the source is very likely the
host galaxy of GRB060807.
Photometry of the source gives values of V=24.9 +-0.1, R=24.26 +-0.05 and
i=22.1 +-0.2 using photometric zeropoints from the NOT/ALFOSC webpage.
This is a very red color as it was found for the color of the OT (GCN
5422) and might indicate a high redshift for this GRB.  More bands however
are required for a final conclusion.
