report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope, we have obtained 3*30 min
spectra (300V) of the GRB 060708 field (Moretti et al., GCN 5292).
The UVOT optical afterglow candidate (Moretti et al., GCN 5292;
Schady & Moretti, GCN 5296) has clearly faded in our acquisition
image. Using photometric zeropoints from the ESO webpages we
estimate the afterglow magnitude to be R ~ 22.9 on July 10.290
(1.778 days post-burst).

The combined spectrum does not display any obvious features. However,
a firm upper limit of z < 2.3 can be placed on the redshift of
GRB 060708 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum
of the afterglow. This is consistent with the UVOT observations
(Schady & Moretti, GCN 5296).

The slit was aligned to cover the galaxy, 8 arcsec south of the
afterglow (just outside the XRT error circle). This galaxy has a
magnitude of R ~ 19.5 and displays numerous absorption features,
such as Ca II (K & H), G-band, H-beta, Mg I, Na I (D) and H-alpha,
corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.249.
