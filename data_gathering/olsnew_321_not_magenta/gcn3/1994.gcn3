SUBJECT: GRB 030329: precise position from Kyoto images

M. Uemura (Kyoto U.), H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U.), R. Ishioka, and T. Kato
(Kyoto U.) report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

  The precise position for the optical afterglow candidate of GRB
030329 (GCN 1985, 1986, 1987, 1689) was derived from Kyoto images (GCN
1689) as (with mean error of measurements of nine images):

    R.A.= 10h44m50s.030 +/- 0s.005,  Decl. = +21d31'18".15 +/- 0".07.

  On the DSS 2 B, R, and I images, there is no distinct source down to
the limiting magnitudes, which indicates the parent galaxy is more
than 8-9 mag dimmer of the OT at 76 minutes after explosion.
