In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190901ap at T0 = 2019-09-01 23:31:01 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 60% of the S190901ap 90% c.l. localization region was accessible to the AGILE MCAL.Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the accessible S190901ap localization region, from a minimum of 1.31E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.28E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with  photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
