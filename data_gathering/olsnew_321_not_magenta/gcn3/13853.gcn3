D. Malesani (DARK), P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OABr), A. Melandri (INAF/OABr), V. 
Nascimbeni (Univ. Padova), C. Padilla (INAF/TNG), report on behalf of 
the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 121011A (Racusin et al., GCN 
13845) with the TNG equipped with DOLoRes.

The afterglow is well detected in a single 5-min exposure, with a mean 
time Oct 11.829 UT (8.63 hr after the GRB). Its magnitude is R = 21.74 
+- 0.06, assuming R = 17.84 for the USNO star at RA = 17:20:44.70, Dec = 
+41:04:52.7.

The afterglow has the following coordinates (calibrated against USNO-B1 
stars):

RA = 17:20:51.22
Dec = +41:06:37.4

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.4".
