report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140102A (L. M. Z. Hagen et al., GCN Circular #15653) with the 
optical three color (g, Rc, and Ic) CCD cameras attached to the MITSuME 50 cm
telescope of Akeno Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.

The observation started on 2014-01-02 21:18:44 UT ( 67sec after the burst).
We detected the previously reported optical afterglow of GRB140102A (D. Xu et al., GCN Circular #15655) in the Ic band.

The measured magnitudes were listed below.
