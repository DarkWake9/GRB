J. Japelj (U. Ljubljana), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), C. Guidorzi
(U. Ferrara) report on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North automatically began observing
GRB 121128A (Oates et al. GCN Circ. 14007) on November 28 2012,
05:07:51 UT corresponding to 134 seconds post burst trigger. We confirm
the presence of a fading source at the optical afterglow candidate position
reported by Oates et al. GCN Circ. 14007. In the first 10 s exposure,
we measure a preliminary R magnitude of 14.5 +- 0.1, calibrated against
nearby USNO-B1 stars.

The candidate was discovered automatically by the LT-TRAP pipeline.
