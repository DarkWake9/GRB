report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

 "At 12:04:36.80 UT on 6 April 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
 triggered and located GRB 160406A (trigger 481637080 / 160406503), 
which was also detected by IPN (Kozlova et al. 2016, GCN 19259). The 
GBM on-ground location is consistent with the IPN triangulated position. 

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 77.5 degrees. 

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse 
with a duration (T90) of about 0.4 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is 
best fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.75 (+0.13/-0.12) and 
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 700 (+210 /-130) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (7.2 +/- 0.4)E-07 erg/cm^2. 
The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+0.0 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 17 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2. 

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
