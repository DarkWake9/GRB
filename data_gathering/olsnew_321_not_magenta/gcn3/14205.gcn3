W. Zheng (UC Berkeley), H. Flewelling (IfA/Hawaii), report on behalf of the
ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 130215
(Swift trigger 548760). The first image was at 01:43:07.3 UT, 697.1 s after
the burst (8.3 s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images are
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a new object, not visible in
the DSS (second epoch), with coordinates:

     02:54:00.7      +13:23:43.7    (J2000), with positional uncertainty of
1" or better

marked 8 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
