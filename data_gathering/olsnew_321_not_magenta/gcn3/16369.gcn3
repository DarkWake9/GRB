S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, D. Svinkin, and 
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, and

V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, V. Pelassa, and A. Goldstein,
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140606B has been observed by Fermi (Burns GCN 
Circ. 16363), Konus-Wind, and MESSENGER (GRNS), so far, at about 11512 s 
UT (03:11:52).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   327.109 (21h 48m 26s) +33.047 (+33d 02' 50")
  Corners:
   321.995 (21h 27m 59s) +37.333 (+37d 19' 58")
   321.768 (21h 27m 04s) +38.102 (+38d 06' 06")
   332.033 (22h 08m 08s) +27.958 (+27d 57' 29")
   332.250 (22h 09m 00s) +26.987 (+26d 59' 14")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 5.53 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 14.18 deg (the minimum one is 0.414 deg).

This box may be improved.

Only two of the reported optical sources (Singer et al. GCN Circ. 
16360), namely iPTF14bfw and iPTF14bfu, are inside the box, and 
iPTF14bfw was found to be a constant source (Perley and Singer, GCN 
Circ. 16362).

The distance between the narrowest annulus (GBM-MESSENGER annulus with 3 
sigma half width of 0.207 deg) center line and the iPTF14bfu (the fading 
  source) is 2 arcsec, strengthening the association of the transient 
and the GRB.

Details of the Konus-Wind observation will be given in a forthcoming GCN 
Circular.
