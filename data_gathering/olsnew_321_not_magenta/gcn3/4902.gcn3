TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB060219: optical observation

FROM:    Alexei Pozanenko at IKI, Moscow  <apozanen@iki.rssi.ru>

D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT, La Palma),  M. Ibrahimov, (MAO), A. Pozanenko
(IKI) and V. Rumyantsev (CrAO) on behalf of larger GRB follow up
collaboration report:

We observed  the X-ray position of GRB060219 (Moretti et al.,  CN4788,
GCN4797) with 1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in R-band
on Feb. 20 (UT) 00:41 - 01:09. The SDSS-source (Moretti et al.,  GCN4801,
Rol et al.,  GCN4855) is clearly detected. We do not detect any other source
within or near XRT circle, in particular the faint source mentioned by Rol
et al., GCN4855.   The R-photometry of the SDSS-source (=galaxy) is
following:

Mid. time,  Exp.,  Galaxy    Limit  Seeing
(UT)        (s)

Feb.20.039    5x300  21.46 +/- 0.11   22.7   ~1.0"

The photometry is based on SDSS stars (Cool et al.,  GCN4789) and
transformation (Lupton 2005). According to the SDSS derived model magnitudes
(Cool, GCN4789) brightness of the galaxy is R=21.72 and our result is
marginally consistent  with  pre-burst observation.
