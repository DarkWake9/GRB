With an additional data set from T-240 to T-61 sec, we report further
analysis of BAT GRB 121031 (trigger #537195) (D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ.
13934).  In an earlier circular (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 13936) we
described the second of two equal-sized peaks from this burst.  BAT
triggered on that second peak.  The earlier peak occurred during a pre-
planned slew maneuver, and its time interval was not covered by the data
available at the time the circular was produced.

The entire burst had two large peaks at T-190 and T0 that were about the
same in flux, duration, and shape.  Each was a FRED about 60 seconds long as
seen in BAT.  There was a small peak at T-50 sec of about 5 seconds duration.
For the entire burst, T90 (15-350 keV) was 226 +- 19 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-209.0 to T+98.3 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.50 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
7.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-190.72 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
