Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140302A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 589685) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 36.5s after the GRB trigger
(14.3s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
48 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were excellent.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+36.5s to t0+96.5s : Rlim = 15.9

The second image is 60.0s exposure in tracking mode.
No afterglow candidate is seen:
t0+140s to t0+200s : Rlim = 19.0

The next images does not show the candidate identified
by Elliott et al. (GCNC 15903) at R=23.7 8.2 min after
the trigger.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
