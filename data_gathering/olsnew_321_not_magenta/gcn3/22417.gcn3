P. Dâ€™Avanzo, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team: 


Swift-XRT has performed observations of the probable new Galactic source 
Swift J1658.2-4242 (trigger=810300; Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ. 22416), 
collecting 137 s of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+5.9 ks and 
T0+6.1 ks.

Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued X-ray
source located at RA,Dec = 254.5524, -42.6988
which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) =  16 58 12.58
DEC (J2000.0) =  -42 41 55.7

with an uncertainty of 3.83 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This location is 41.6 arcsec from the BAT position, inside the BAT
error circle.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team
