The bright GRB 200131A detected by Swift (Sbarufatti et al.,
GCN Circ. 26953, Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 26967;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200131A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:41:11.299 UTC
on 31 January 2020. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T+3.3 sec, peaks at T+3.8 sec and ends at T+6.4 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 2.2 +- 0.1 sec
and 1.4 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/ground/1264545439/

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
