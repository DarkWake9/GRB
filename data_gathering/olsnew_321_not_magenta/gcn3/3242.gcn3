NUMBER:  3242
SUBJECT: GRB050412: P60 Observations

S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050412 with the automated Palomar 60-inch
telescope.  Observations began approximately 6 minutes after the burst.
Our early time images consist of 3 x 60 second exposures each in the
Kron R (mean epoch 5:57 UT, t ~ 13 minutes after the burst) and Gunn i
(6:02 UT) and z (6:12 UT) bands.  We find no sources in the XRT error
circle reported in GCN 3241.  Our limiting magnitude, estimated by
comparison with several stars from the Guide Star Catalog, is
approximately R < 20.0
