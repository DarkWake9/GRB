A. Volnova (IKI), V. Kim (AFIF), A. Pozanenko (IKI), M. Krugov (AFIF), 
E. Mazaeva  (IKI), S. Belkin (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB IKI 
FuN collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 200115A (Cenko et al.,  GCN 26771)  with 
AZT-20 1.5 m telescope  of Assy-Turgen observatory  starting on Jan. 18 
(UT) 16:55:27  in  r'-filter.   We do not detect the afterglow candidate 
(GCNs 26790, 26818) up to r'=22.8 (AB) and hence we consider the object 
found in BAT error circle (Cenko et al.,  GCN 26771) as the optical 
afterglow of GRB 200215A.

Photometry of the field is following.

2019-10-18 16:55:27   3.22608     r'    13*180 n/d  22.8

The photometry is based on the nearby SDSS-DR12 stars.
