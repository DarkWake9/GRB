TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 160411A: Swift-XRT observations

M. Perri (ASDC), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U.
Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU) and G. Cusumano
(INAF-IASF PA) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 160411A at 02:21:04.2 UT,
3132.3 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 349.35590,
-40.24247 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 17m 25.42s
   Dec(J2000) = -40d 14' 32.9"
with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 103 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.61
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
