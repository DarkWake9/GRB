report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 00:43:19.90 UT on 14 March 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180314A (trigger 542681004 / 180314030),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(D'Avanzo et al. 2018, GCN 22478).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 99 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1 s to T0+30 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.36 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 104 +/- 3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.52 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+15.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.5 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
