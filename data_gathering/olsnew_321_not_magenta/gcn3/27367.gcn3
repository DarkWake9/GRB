and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 200307A (The Fermi GBM team,
GCN Circ. 27344; Goldstein et al., GCN Circ. 27356) was detected
by Fermi (GBM trigger 605309224), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and
Swift (BAT), at about 77219 s UT (21:26:59).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=81.577 deg (05h 26m 18s)  Dec(2000)=-38.418 deg (-38d 25' 05"),
whose radius is 32.263 +/- 3.868 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
joint Fermi-GBM/Swift-BAT one (GCN Circ. 27356).

This localization may be improved.
