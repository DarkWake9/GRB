The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:00:31 UT on 31 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211231A (trigger 662626836.787242 / 211231292).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 292.2, Dec = -24.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 28m, -24d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
