M. Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:36:53.71 UT on 29 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140729A (trigger 428287016 / 140729026).
It was also detected by Fermi LAT (Arimoto et al. 2014, GCN 16633).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 78 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s
to T0+78.3 s is well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.9 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 866 +/- 162 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.70 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.328 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
