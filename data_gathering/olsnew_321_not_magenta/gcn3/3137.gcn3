on behalf of the Swift team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (#112060) at 22:46:40 UT is not due to a GRB.
The trigger occurred while Vela X-1 was in the BAT FOV and in a
variable state.  Ground analysis has confirmed the very low
image-domain significance of the detection.  A visual inspection
of the mask-tagged light curve shows no significant emission
from the reported location.  Analysis of the XRT data shows
no source in the FOV.
