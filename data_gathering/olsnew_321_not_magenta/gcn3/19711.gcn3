Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.2 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode XRT data for the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 160714A (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 19705),
collected between T0+1.7 ks and T0+43.3 ks. 

Three uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected within 296 arcsec
of the Swift/BAT position, however none of them is above the RASS limit
or shows definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the present time we
cannot identify which, if any, is the afterglow. Details of these
sources are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  234.3249  =  15:37:17.98
  Dec (J2000.0): +63.8684  =  +63:52:06.3
  Error: 4.3 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (5.8 +/- 1.2)e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 254 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (1.78 +/- 0.37)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 4:
  RA (J2000.0):  234.5768  =  15:38:18.43
  Dec (J2000.0): +63.7722  =  +63:46:19.8
  Error: 4.8 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (3.07 +/- 0.95)e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 280 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (8.3 +/- 2.6)e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 9:
  RA (J2000.0):  234.4312  =  15:37:43.50
  Dec (J2000.0): +63.8530  =  +63:51:10.9
  Error: 7.1 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (1.70 +/- 0.76)e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 92 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (7.0 +/- 3.2)e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Eight uncatalogued sources were also detected too far from the GRB
position to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
