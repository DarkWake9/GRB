Hertfordshire), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

We have obtained Sloan i and Harris R & V band images of the field of
GRB 000926 (GCN #801), using the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5m Isaac
Newton Telescope at La Palma. Using aperture photometry (with a radius
twice the FWHM), we find the magnitude of the OT, relative
to the reference star of Halpern et al. (GCN #824), to be as follows:

(errors are statistical only)


We have fitted the R band data, together with all published data (GCNs
#809, #814, #816, #819, #820, #824, #825, GCN #829, #831, #840), with a
smoothly broken power-law, and a constant flux (presumably from the
underlying host galaxy).  The fitted function is

   F(t) = { F_1^(-n) + F_2^(-n) }^(-1/n) + F_host,

                               with F_i = k_i t ^(-a_i), n > 0; i = 1, 2.

a_1 and a_2 correspond to the early and late time power-law indices,
respectively. The break time t_0 corresponds to the time when F_1 = F_2.

(see e.g. Beuermann, K., et al 1999, A&A, 352, L26-L30)


We obtain the following parameters for the R band data, with n fixed at 1:

    a_1 = 1.1 +- 0.2
    a_2 = 3.2 +- 0.4
    t_0 = 2.0 +- 0.4
    host:  R = 24.2 +- 0.3

Errors are 1 sigma; chi^2/DOF = 69/31. Excluding the host,
we find a chi^2/DOF = 83/32.

The fit shows a rather large increase in the decay-rate of the OT flux
around two days after the burst (from a power-law index of 1.1 to
3.2). Fitting for n as well (which can be used to define the
sharpness of the break) gives the same results as above, with n = 1.1
+- 0.8.
