W. Fong (U. Arizona) and D. B. Fox (PSU) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the location of the long-duration GRB 141026A (Hagen et al.,
GCN 16950) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) and the Near
InfraRed Imager (NIRI) mounted on the Gemini-North 8-m telescope starting
on 2014 Oct 26.402 UT (7.03 hr after the BAT trigger). We obtained 540-sec
of z-band imaging, and a total of 1800-sec in the YJHKs-bands. We clearly
detect the afterglow (Littlejohns et al., GCN 16952; Varela et al., GCN
16953; Gorosabel et al., GCN 16954; Perley et al., GCN 16955; Butler et
al., GCN 16962, GCN 16970; Moskvitin et al., GCN 16966) in all bands. Using
tabulated Gemini zeropoints, we measure an afterglow brightness of z(AB) =
22.0 +/- 0.1 mag and J(AB) = 21.9 +/- 0.1 mag at 7.03 hr after the burst.
These magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction in the
direction of the burst.

We thank the Gemini staff for their assistance with these observations."
