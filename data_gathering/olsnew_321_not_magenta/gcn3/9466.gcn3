We observed the field of GRB 090530 detected by Swift (trigger #353567;  
Cannizzo et al., GCN #9438) with the 14-inch Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT)  
located at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory  
(http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).   
 
100 set of 30 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting 
from May 30 03:33:00 (UT) about 15 min after the trigger and 
stopped on May 30 04:29:30 (UT).  We do not detect the optical 
afterglow (Cannizzo et al., GCN #9438, Flewelling et al., GCN #9439, 
Nissinen et al., GCN #9441, Malesani et al., GCN #9452, Im et al., 
GCN #9459) both in the individual images and the combined image.  
The estimated three sigma upper limit of the combined image (total 
exposure of 3000 sec) is ~18.1 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
