report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 120514A (Mangano et al. 
GCNC 13289) using LABOCA/APEX at Chajnantor (Chile) in the 
870 micrometer band. The weather conditions were good, with 
precipitable water vapour at the time of the observation of ~0.5mm. 
Observations began on May 14 at 4:55 UT (3.7 hr after the burst) 
and were performed using the photometric mode, centred at the 
enhanced X-ray position (Evans et al. GCNC 13292).

On a preliminary analysis of 160 min on source, we detect a flux 
density at the position of the afterglow of 6.2+/-2.3 mJy.

Further observations are foreseen. We encourage follow-up 
observations in other wavelengths.
