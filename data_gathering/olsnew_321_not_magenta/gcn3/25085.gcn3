report:

The 30cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malargue
(Argentina) reacted robotically to the Swift/BAT alert
of GRB190718A (D'Elia et al., GCNC 25082), starting
with a series of 20s unfiltered images at 04:45:11 UT,
i.e. 236s post trigger.

We do not detect any new source at or around the
reported X-ray errorbox reported by Evans et al. (GCN
25084) at single frames or a combined 20 x 20s image
taken between 236s and 1123s after the initial trigger.
The combined exposure  has a limiting magnitude r'(AB)
= 18.0, as calibrated against the APASS Catalogue.
