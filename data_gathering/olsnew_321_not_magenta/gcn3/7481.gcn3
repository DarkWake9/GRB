A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) reports on behalf of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 080319B afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at March 19 20.24 UT to March 20
8.22 UT, i.e. 14.0 - 26.0 hours after the burst (GCN 7427).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 7428). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around that position is
84 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
position of the optical counterpart is 59 +/- 26 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for rapidly scheduling and obtaining
these observations."
