V. D’Elia (SSDC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team:

We performed further analysis of the Swift data of the BAT trigger 872470 (D’Aì et al. GCN Circ. 23425)

The ground analysis using the BAT data set from T-239 to T+963 sec shows nothing significant in the BAT light curves. Also, the BAT image significance decreases to ~ 1.4 sigma.

The Swift/XRT began settled observations of the field 1033 s after the BAT trigger. The total exposure time is 2.8 ks, and data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No X-ray sources have been detected in the BAT error circle. The 3-sigma upper limit at the BAT position is 6E-3 cts/s corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 2e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field 1074 s after the BAT trigger. No optical afterglow consistent with the BAT position is detected in the initial UVOT exposures to a limiting magnitude in the white filter of 20.4.

We thus conclude that this trigger was indeed due to particle background near the SAA and is not an astrophysical event
