A. Cucchiara and D. B. Fox (PSU) reports on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We have imaged the field of GRB 080207 (Racusin et al., GCN 7264)
with the Gemini South + GMOS in griz bandds starting at 0.41 days
after the trigger.

We took a sequence of 5x 180s images in each band (total exposure
900s).  Our co-added images do not reveal any source inside the XRT
refined error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 7265).  Using three
objects from the SDSS catalog to establish photometric zero-points, we
calculate the following 2-sigma upper limits on the emission of any
optical afterglow + host galaxy: g > 24.1 mag, r > 24.5 mag, i > 24.2
mag, z > 25.0 mag."
