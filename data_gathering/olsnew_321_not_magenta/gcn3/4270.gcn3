TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4270
SUBJECT: GRB 051111: Radio afterglow
DATE:    05/11/14 15:38:25 GMT
FROM:    Dale A. Frail at NRAO  <dfrail@nrao.edu>

Dale A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the bright GRB 051111 (GCN 4248) with the
Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz around November 13.15 UT. At the position
of the optical transient (GCN 4247; GCN 4250) there is a weak radio
source with a flux density 98 +/- 28 uJy.  We identify this as the radio
afterglow of GRB 051111.

Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
