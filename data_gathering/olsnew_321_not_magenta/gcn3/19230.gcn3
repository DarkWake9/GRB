A. Melandri, D. Fugazza (INAF-OAB), M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL)  report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Further analysis of REM near-infrared observations of the field of of GRB 160325A (Sonbas et al., GCN 19222) showed that the source reported as candidate afterglow in our earlier imaging (Fugazza & Melandri, GCN 19223; McCauley & Sonbas, GCN 19228) has faded in the JHK filters. Observations cover the time interval bewteen ~1 and 120 minutes after the burst event.

The light curve has an initial decay of alpha1 ~ 0.45, and after 10 minutes it steepens to alpha2 ~ 1.5. The fading nature confirms that this source is the afterglow of GRB 160325A.
