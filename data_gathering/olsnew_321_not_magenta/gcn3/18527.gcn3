Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151029A (trigger #662086)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 18522).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 38.537, -35.356 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 34m 09.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 21' 21.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 41%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks starting 
at ~T-2 sec, peaking at ~T+1 se, and ending at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.95 +- 2.32 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.10 to T+10.47 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.49 +- 1.08, 
and Epeak of 33.9 +- 6.9 keV (chi squared 53.8 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.9 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T-0.15 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
1.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 2.16 +- 0.19 (chi squared 64.3 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
