Bannister (Leicester) report:

  "The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North robotically followed up GRB070208
  (SWIFT trigger 259714; GCN 6074 Sato et al) 2.33 min after the GRB 
trigger time.

  We identify a fading uncatalogued source at:

  13:11:32.51
  +61:57:54.5 (J2000)

This afterglow candidate is located close to but south-west of the 
extended galaxy visible in the SDSS. The of the two sources identified by 
Mirabal et al. (GCN 6075), we suggest the SW source is the afterglow.

Observations are ongoing."
