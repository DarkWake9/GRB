team report:

The long GRB 080714 (Swift-BAT trigger
#316910: Perri et al., GCN 7978, Barthelmy et al., GCN 7979) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=64378.478 s UT (17:52:58.478).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~20s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.64(-0.60, +0.87)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.544 s
of 6.84(-1.79, +2.01)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+16.640 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV-1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.24(-0.39, +0.46)
and Ep = 137(-34, +100) keV (chi2 = 48.3/52 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
