We observed the field of GRB 170705A (Starling, et al., GCN 21289) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/07 5.17 to 2017/07 5.26 UTC (1.34 to 3.41
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.42 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 0.59 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We detect the optical transient found by Swift and observed MASTER-OAFA
(Lipunov, et al., GCN 21291).  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS
catalogs, we obtain the following detections:

 r = 18.60 +/- 0.01
 i = 18.30 +/- 0.01
 Z = 18.03 +/- 0.01
 Y = 17.79 +/- 0.01
 J = 17.79 +/- 0.01
 H = 17.56 +/- 0.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source fades as in time as
t^(-0.4) during our observation.

We note that the Swift-UVOT detection makes this GRB unlikely to be at very
high redshift.  Our photo-z calculations, using RATIR data alone, suggest
z<4.

Mártir.
