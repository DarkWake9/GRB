report on behalf of the LOTIS collaboration:

The realtime BATSE trigger came at 7:37 pm local time when the sky
was too bright for observation. However, Lotis' wide-field-of-view
sky patrol data covered the grb000408 IPN error box (GCN 626) 
1.64 hours after the burst (15241s UTC). Comparison of the 
images with the previous sky patrol images, the Digital Sky Survey, 
and the Guide Star Catalog reveal no OT within the IPN error box 
brighter than m = 15.0 (5-sigma). No astronomical filter was used 
during these observations. Further analysis is in progress.
