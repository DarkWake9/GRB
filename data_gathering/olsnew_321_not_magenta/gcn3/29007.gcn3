SUBJECT: GRB 201209A: KAIT Optical Upper Limit

FROM:    Weikang Zheng at UC Berkeley  <weikang@berkeley.edu>

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 201209A (Gropp et al.,
GCN 29005) starting at 05:48:09 UT, 197 s after the burst under
cloudy condition. Observations were performed with an automatic
sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the
exposure time was 20 s per image. We do not detect any optical
afterglow candidate within the XRT position error circle (Gropp
et al., GCN 29005), neither in single image, nor in the co-add images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
15.0 mag calibrated to the USNOB1.0 catalog.
