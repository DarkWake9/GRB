report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:07:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090129 (trigger=341504). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 269.092, -32.826 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 56m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 49' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a FRED-like
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger until
at least 03 Feb 2009. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. Ziaeepour (hz AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
