"We observed the optical transient candidate of GRB 000926 (Gorosabel
et al., GCN #803; Dall et. al., GCN #804) with the AZT-24 1.1-meter
telescope at Campo Imperatore (AQ).

The J-band observation started at September 28.8481 UT and the field
was imaged for a total exposure time of 1800 sec. We observed a source
at a position:

    RA(J2000)=   17h 04m 09.11s
    DEC(J2000)= +51o 47' 09.3"
    (uncertainty is 2")

consistent with the optical transient of GRB 000926 (GCN #803) having
a magnitude of J=18.6+/-0.3 mag with a S/N=5.

The K-band observation started at Sep. 28.9345 UT and the field was
imaged for a total exposure time of 1800 sec. The limiting magnitude
reached in the K-band was K=17.0 mag (S/N=3) with an average FWHM of
2.5", no sources were detected at the above position.
