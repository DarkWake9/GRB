NUMBER:  4416
SUBJECT: GRB 051221A: VLA Radio Observations
DATE:    05/12/29 22:53:24 GMT
FROM:    Dale A. Frail at NRAO  <dfrail@nrao.edu>

Dale A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 051221A afterglow at 8.5 GHz with
the Very Large Array on 2005 December 21.99 UT, December 23.02 UT,
December 24.83 UT, and December 27.96 UT (GCN 4366; GCN 4367; GCN
4369). On the first epoch (2005 December 21.99 UT) we detect weak
radio emission coincident with the X-ray and optical afterglow, with a
peak flux density of 88 +/- 26 uJy. The source is not detected on any
subsequent epochs with rms noise levels of 24 to 32 uJy.

No further observations are planned.
