We observed the field of the GRB 190109B (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 23648) 
with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy).  We obtained 
several images in R-filter starting on Jan. 09 (UT) 12:17:03, i.e. 21 
minutes after the burst trigger.  We do not detect any object within 
enhanced Swift-XRT position  (Beardmore et al., GCN 23652). Preliminary 
photometry of the field is following.

Date        UT start  t-T0      Filter Exp.   OT      Err.  UL(3sigma)
