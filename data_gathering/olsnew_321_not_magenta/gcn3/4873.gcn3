Using the data set from T-60 to T+123 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060313 (trigger #201487)
(Pagani, et al., GCN 4867).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec =
66.624,-10.859 deg {04h 26m 29.8s,-10d 51' 30.9"} (J2000) +- 1.0 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 54%.
 
The lightcurve shows 3 or 4 overlapping peaks.  They start with a very fast
rise (less than 40 msec).  There is a possibility of further faint emission
past the end of the last peak (T+1 to T+2 sec).  T90 (15-350 keV) is
0.7 +- 0.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.06 to T+0.94 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 0.71 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.13 +- 0.05 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 12.1 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
