P. D'Avanzo and G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB) on behalf of the MISTICI 
collaboration report:

We observed the field of the GRB 080229 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 7335) with 
the ESO-VLT on March 01.411 UT (about 16.8 hours after the burst). 
Observations have been carried out in J-band with the ISAAC NIR camera 
in imaging mode under very good (0.7") seeing conditions.

We do not detect any afterglow candidate inside the enhanced XRT error 
box (Beardmore et al., GCN 7343) down to J > 21.6 (3sigma c.l., 
calibrated against the 2MASS catalog).

We acknowledge support from the ESO staff, in particular Thomas Szeifert.
