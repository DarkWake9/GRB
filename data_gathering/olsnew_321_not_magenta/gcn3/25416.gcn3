We observed the field of the optical transients detected with DECam
(Goldstein et al., GCN Circ. 25393; Herner et al. 25373) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Martir from 2019/08 20.30 to 2019/08 20.50 UTC, obtaining
a total of about 10 minutes exposure on each field  in the r band.

We detect the following candidates with magnitudes:

(a) the object is in the central part of the galaxy

Photometric measurements are contaminated by host galaxy light.

We also observed at the position of DG19wlpmc and DG19rtekc, but we do not
detect any object down to a magnitude of ~22 and ~21, respectively.

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the source.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro
Martir.
