The AMI Large Array responded robotically to Swift trigger 748858 (a 
possible GRB; Siegel et al., GCN 21011) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Apr 19.79 and Apr 21.09 
(UT) do not reveal any radio source in the BAT error circle (Sakamoto et 
al., GCN 21017), with 3sigma upper limits of 195 uJy and 120 uJy 
respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
