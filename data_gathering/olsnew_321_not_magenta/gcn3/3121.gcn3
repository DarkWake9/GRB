K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports

 "The error region of GRB 050319 (GCN 3117) was observed by the 
ART 14-inch telescope. BVRcIc imaging started at 2005 March 19, 11:24
UT and 60-s exposure in each filter was repeated.

 By stacking twenty Rc and twenty Ic frames obtained between 11:36 UT
and 13:05 UT (Mean Epoch 12:20 UT), we note an enhancement of
2.3-sigma level at the position of the optical afterglow (GCN
3116). The enhancement in the stacked frame corresponds to 19.6 mag
with reference to USNO-A2.0 red magnitude.

 Combining this magnitude and those reported in GCN 3116 and GCN 3120,
the early optical afterglow of GRB 050319 decays with relatively
shallow power-law index of t^(-0.6)."
