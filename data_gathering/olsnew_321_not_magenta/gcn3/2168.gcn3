Optical Observations of GRB 030418 with Magellan

report:

On 2003 April 21.01 UT, we observed the optical afterglow (Price et 
al; GCN2148) of the HETE-localized GRB 030418 (=H2686) with the 
Magellan 6.5 meter Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in 
Chile.  Our observations consisted of three 300s R-Band images and 
one 300s I-Band image, taken with the MagIC instrument.  The 
afterglow brightness had declined significantly since the 
measurement reported in GCN2148, consistent with a power law decay 
index = 1.3+/-0.1. The afterglow was still point-like in our images, 
with a FWHM of 0.5 arcsec. Our results were as follows:

UT                 t-t0 (days)    Mag
2003-04-21.02      2.60           R=23.64 +/- 0.07
2003-04-21.03      2.61           I=22.60 +/- 0.05

The magnitudes reported above are relative to those of the USNO B1 
catalog star at RA = 10h 54m 32.71s, Dec = -07:02:16.4 (J2000), taken 
as having R=19.33 and I=18.31. Magnitude errors for the USNO star 
were not available, and so are not included in the errors we report 
here.  Possible errors in the magnitudes of the USNO catalog star 
should be taken into account when comparing our afterglow magnitudes 
to other measurements. Further observations are planned.
