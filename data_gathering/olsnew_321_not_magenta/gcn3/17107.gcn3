D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

A short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 141125A has been observed by 
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), MESSENGER (GRNS), and Swift (BAT), so 
far, at about 12781 s UT (03:33:01). The burst was outside the coded 
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
   ---------------------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
   ---------------------------------------------
   Center:
    127.910 (08h 31m 38s) -29.874 (-29d 52' 28")
   Corners:
    127.504 (08h 30m 01s) -30.527 (-30d 31' 36")
    127.358 (08h 29m 26s) -31.092 (-31d 05' 29")
    128.315 (08h 33m 16s) -29.209 (-29d 12' 33")
    128.465 (08h 33m 52s) -28.616 (-28d 36' 57")
   ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 857 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 2.65 deg (the minimum one is 7 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 97 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
