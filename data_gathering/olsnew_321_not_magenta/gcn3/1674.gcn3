SGR1900+14 remains active.  The following is a non-exhaustive list
of the bursts observed over the last several days.

DATE (DDMMYY)	TIME, S.	OBSERVED BY*	FLUENCE, erg/cm2	DURATION, S.	COMMENTS
_____________   ________        ___________     ________________        ____________    ________

011102		68889		U,K,M		8.5E-6			0.5		
021102		15414		U,K		3.3E-6			0.3
021102		23998		U,K		2.9E-6			0.5
021102		24159-25078	U,K,H		1.8 - 17.E-6		Up to 1 s	Cluster of ~10 evemts

* U=Ulysses
  K=Konus-Wind
  M=Mars Odyssey/HEND
  H=HETE/FREGATE

Numerous other SGR-like events have been observed by only one spacecraft, 
and they are likely to have originated from SGR1900+14, but for the time
being, they cannot be localized.  

We note that the burst on November 1, which was observed by Mars Odyssey/HEND,
confirms the timing of that spacecraft to high accuracy.

From now on, unless an exceptional burst occurs, we will issue IPN notices 
for groups of events during this period of activity, instead of for single events.
