The Zadko telescope started observing the field of
GRB 090313 (trigger=346386, Mao et al. GCN 8980)
4.26h after the Swift trigger, under difficult conditions due to
significant sky brightness from the Moon.

Preliminary photometry of unfiltered images
taken with an iKon DW436BV camera show a slow
decay of the optical afterglow:


Time(s)     Magnitude
-------------------------------------
21356       18.02 +/- 0.08
22662       18.49 +/- 0.10
24115       18.49 +/- 0.10
26028       18.62 +/- 0.09
27890       18.78 +/- 0.09
29834       18.84 +/- 0.12

Magnitudes were calibrated with respect to the
nearby USNOB1 star 0980-0264084 (13 13 36.392
+08 04 47.69). The optical afterglow is close
to a 16.37 magnitude galaxy (PGC 1338801).

The Zadko Telescope is currently being commissioned.
