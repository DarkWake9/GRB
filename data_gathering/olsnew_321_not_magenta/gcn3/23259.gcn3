and the CALET collaboration:

The MAXI GRB 180923A (Maruyama et al., GCN Circ. 23257) was detected
in ground analysis of the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data
near the MAXI/GSC trigger time at T0=04:08:25 UT on 23 September 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T-18 sec and ends at T+107 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
122 +- 15 sec and 95 +- 58 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
The significant emission is seen only below ~100 keV.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
