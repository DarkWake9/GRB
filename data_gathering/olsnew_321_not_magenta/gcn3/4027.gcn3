R. Novak (N. Copernicus Observatory in Brno, Czech Republic),

report:

We have observed the optical transient of GRB050922C reported
by Rykoff et al. (GCN 4011) for 2h with the mean time 0.1d
after the GRB trigger (Norris et al., GCN 4013) with the 40cm
telescope at N. Copernicus Observatory equipped with an ST7 CCD (with
R band filter). We have found the OT as very faint object close to 18
mag. More data reductions will follow.
