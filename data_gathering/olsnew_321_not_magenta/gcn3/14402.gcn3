In reviewing the Swift/BAT event data for Trigger 553930 (Baumgartner et al, GCN 
14396) we see no signs of significant activity from the RS CVn flare star HR 
5110.  Therefore we conclude that Trigger 553930 was a noise event in chance 
coincidence with a catalog source and is not due to an astrophysical event.
