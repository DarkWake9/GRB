Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220706A (trigger #1114937)
(D'Ai, et al., GCN Circ. 32329).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 0.577, -16.411 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  00h 02m 18.5s
    Dec(J2000) = -16d 24' 38.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
  
The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a bright peak starting from
T-3 s to T+30 s.  The weak emission is evident in the 10-s binned
light curve starting from T-80 s to T+70 s.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
86.9 +- 18.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-71.84 to T+36.15 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.75 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.72 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
