report:

Using the data set from T-3 to T+107 sec from recent telemetry
downlinks, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080130
(T_zero chosen as 11:13:59 UT) detected during a Swift slew maneuver
(Copete, et al., GCN Circ. 7242).  The BAT ground-calculated position
from postslew (after T+33 sec) data is RA, Dec = 261.632, -53.190 deg,
which is
   RA(J2000) =  17h 26m 31.6s
  Dec(J2000) = -53d 11' 24"
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The burst was in the fully coded field of view after the slew.

The mask-weighted light curve shows 3 peaks at about T+4, T+30, and
T+63 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 65 +- 5 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1 to T+68.0 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.21 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
(7.7 +- 2.8) x 10^-7  erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
from T+36 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.2 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
