E. Rol (Univ. of Amsterdam), R. Strom (NFRA, UoA), P. Vreeswijk (UoA),
C. Kouveliotou (USRA, NASA/MSFC), L. Kaper (UoA) report, on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the IPN error box of the GRB000301A (GCN #567) at
4.9 GHz with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We obtained a 6
hour observation, centered at March 2.64 UT. Within the error box, we
detect only one source, at a flux level of 0.37 +- 0.055 mJy. The
position of the source is (J2000):

	RA	23:39:47
	Decl	75:46:15

with a conservative error of 2 arcseconds.

At this point, we do not claim that this is the radio counterpart to
GRB000301A. We are currently trying to find a catalogue for this
wavelength to compare with. Observations of the error box will
continue with the WSRT."
