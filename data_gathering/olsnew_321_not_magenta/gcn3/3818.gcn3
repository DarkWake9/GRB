Sarunas Mikolaitis (ITPA, Lithuania) report:

We have continued monitoring the field of GRB 050814.485 in the I band using
ALFOSC on the 2.56-meter Nordic Optical Telescope. Compared to our previous
epoch (Jensen et al. GCN#3809) the proposed afterglow appears to be fading.

By comparison with 5 standard stars in SA92 (Landolt, 1992, AJ, 104, 340)
we estimate the following magnitude for the afterglow:

Date (UT)   Filter  Exptime  Seeing  Mag
Aug 15.96   I       3x300s   0.8"    21.4

Using I = 20.5 from GCN#3809, the preliminary decay slope is alpha = 0.95.
