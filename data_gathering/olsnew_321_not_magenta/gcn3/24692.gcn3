report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 10:19:08.90 UT on 30 May 2019, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located
GRB 190530A (trigger 580904353 / 190530430, GCN #24676),
which was also detected by AGILE-MCAL (GCN # 24678) and
Fermi-LAT (GCN # 24679).

The GBM light curve consists of multiple bright peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 18.4 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+20 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 900 +/- 10 keV,
alpha = -1.00 +/- 0.01, and beta = -3.64 +/- 0.12.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval
is (3.72 +/- 0.01)E-04 erg/cm^2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+16.4 s
in the 10-1000 keV band is 160.5 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
