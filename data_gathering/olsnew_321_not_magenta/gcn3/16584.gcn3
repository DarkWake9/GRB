Using the data set from T-239 to T+325 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140713A (trigger #604232)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 16581).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 281.141, 59.623 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 44m 33.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +59d 37' 22.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks starting at ~T-0.2 sec, peaking
at ~T+0.2 and ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
5.30 +- 0.66 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.11 to T+6.68 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.84 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
