(APC) report for AMON (https://amon.psu.edu/):

The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope (XRT) observed the
uncertainty region of the IceCube neutrino event IceCube-220622A (GCN Circ.
32260) between 2022-06-24 20:07 UTC and 2022-06-25 02:24 UTC.
A 7-point tiling observation centered on the neutrino position was taken
for a total of 6.8 ksec.

One possible X-ray candidate counterparts was detected with a flux of
~5x10^-13 erg/s/cm^2.
The counterpart is consistent with the active galaxy 1RXS J145552.7+414026
at an angular distance of 0.38 degrees from the neutrino position.

Multiwavelength follow-up of the source is encouraged.
