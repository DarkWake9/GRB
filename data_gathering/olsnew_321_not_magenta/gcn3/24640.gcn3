The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data around the
time of the compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidate S190521g
(GCN 24621). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed
via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190521g

LALInference.fits.gz is the preferred sky map at this time.
The 90% credible region is 765 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky,
the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 3931 +/- 953 Mpc
(a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents
of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
