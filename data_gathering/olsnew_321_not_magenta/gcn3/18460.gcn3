report:

 We observed several nearby bright galaxies within the error region of the
possible GW event G194575 (GCN #18442), with the CQUEAN instrument on the
McDonald observatory's 2.1m telescope (Park et al. 2012, PASP, 124, 839)
and LOAO (Mt. Lemmon Astronomy Observatory) 1-m telescope (Lee et al. 2010,
JKAS, 43, 95). CQUEAN covers a field of view of 4.7' by 4.7' centered on
each galaxy and LOAO 1-m's field of view is 20' by 20'. The observations
started at 2015-10-23 02:28 (UT) for CQUEAN, and 2015-10-23 07:08 (UT) for
LOAO. Five galaxies were observed so far in R and I filters with 3 min
exposure per filter.

No obvious transient was found in the data taken so far. We plan to
continue the observation of these and other nearby galaxies with our
 facilities. We thank the staff of LOAO for carrying out the observation.
