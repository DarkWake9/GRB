We observed four fields corresponding to IceCube neutrino events (Bartos et al., GCN 21508) with the 2 metre Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). We used the HFOSC instrument with a 10' x 10' FoV to  obtain 3 R band exposures of 180 seconds each for the following fields:

RA (deg)  Dec(deg)
291.4     69.0
226.7     12.0
291.3     68.8
01.4      23.8

Visual inspection of the images shows no new source that could be associated with G298048. We note that all four locations are outside the revised HLV localisation region (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al, GCN 21513).
