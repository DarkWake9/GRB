on behalf of the EAFON report;

"We made further optical observations for the optical afterglow of GRB
080721 (Marshall et al., GCN 7988; Chen et al., GCN 7990) using the
Lulin 1 m telescope. The single R-band image with 300 sec exposure
shows the afterglow well with R=21.3 (mid term of the exposure is
26.19 hours after the burst). Comparison with our previous report
(Chen et al. GCN 7990), the temporal decay index is ~1.0. This is
consistent with the result reported by Jakobsson et al. (GCN 7998).
