report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:50:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SWIFT J174540.2-290037 (trigger=690226).  Swift was already
pointed at the source. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 266.355, -29.016 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 45m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 00' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  Since this was a 32-minute image
trigger, the BAT light curve does not show any significant
features. 

Since Swift was already pointed at the source, XRT and UVOT
data from this time period will be available when it is
downlinked through the ground stations. 

This source is consistent with the source that has triggered 
BAT three previous times (Barthelmy et al., GCN 19499, 19514, 19515).  
This is most likely the recently-detected source SWIFT J174540.2-290037, 
which has continued to brighten in the XRT during routine monitoring
(Degenaar et al. Atel #9109).
