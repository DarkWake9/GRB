The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:54:05 UT on 13 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201213A (trigger 629574850.751498 / 201213746).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 239.8, Dec = -28.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 59m, -28d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 56.0 degrees.
