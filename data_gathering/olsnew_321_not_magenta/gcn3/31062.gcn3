During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long
burst, GRB 211109C, at 2021-11-09T07:51:02.200 UTC (denoted as T0).

GECAM alert data was downlinked to the ground through the short message
service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) within ~60 s after T0.

According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of a broad pulse
with a duration of about 50 s. 

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Using the automatic on-ground localization pipeline with the BDS alert data, 
GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): 
Ra: 183.6 deg 
Dec: -55.9 deg
Err: 5.6 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees 
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

The GECAM preliminary location could be found here:

Given that the location is consistent with the Galactic plane, we cannot rule
out the galactic origin of this burst.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
