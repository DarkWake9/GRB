J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU), H. A. Krimm (NSF),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 04:06:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191213A (trigger=944091).  Due to a Sun constraint,
Swift did not slew to this burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 224.507, -9.726 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 14h 58m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 43' 33"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger, there is
no obvious variation in the immediately-available lightcurve. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 16:25 UT on 2019 December 23. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. B. Cenko (brad.cenko AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
