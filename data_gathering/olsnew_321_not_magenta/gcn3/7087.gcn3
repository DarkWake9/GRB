T. Ishimura, T. Shimokawabe, Y. Mori, Y. Kudou, N. Vasquez, Y. Yatsu, 
and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071112C (Perri et al., GCN 7059) with
the 3-color 50cm MITSuME Telescope at Akeno, Japan starting at
18:34:39 UT, 102s after the trigger.

In the images of g' and Rc bands, we detected the optical
counterpart reported by several authors (GCNs 7059, 7061, 7062 etc.).
Photometric calibration was done using the USNO-B1.0 (Ic-band) and
NOMAD (g'-bands) catalogs.  The results are following:

start time  end time     Exposure    g' [mag]       Rc[mag]

18:34:39   18:35:39      1 x 60s     17.6 +/- 0.5  17.3 +/- 0.3
