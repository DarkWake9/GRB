At 02:44:19.17 UTC (9859.17 s UT) on 13 Aug 2002, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2262, a bright, long GRB.  The
WXM flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Position
Notice at 10:50:48 UT, 4 min 14 sec after the burst.  Ground analysis
of the WXM data for the burst produced a refined location, which was
reported in a GCN Position Notice at 04:36:58 UT, 117 minutes after the
burst.  The WXM location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle
that is 4 arcminutes in radius (due entirely to the systematic error)
and is centered at

RA = 19h 46m 41s, Dec = -19o 38' 42" (J2000).


Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst also produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 05:48:35 UT,
184 minutes after the burst.  The SXC location can be expressed as a
90% confidence circle that is 60 arcseconds in radius (due entirely
to the systematic error) and is centered at

RA = 19h 46m 38s, Dec = -19o 35' 16" (J2000).


In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of >125 seconds.
In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst also had a duration of >125
seconds.  The WXM localization SNR was >100.  The SXC localization SNR
was 12.
