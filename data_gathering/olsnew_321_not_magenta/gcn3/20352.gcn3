S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and
D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space) report on behalf of the Swift
Team:

At 19:46:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located V2293 Oph (trigger=729410).  Swift did not slew because of
the Sun observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 259.889, -25.025, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 19m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = -25d 01' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The real-time light curve does not show anything,
as is typical for image triggers. 

This source is in Sun observing constraint until January 27.  So there will be
no XRT or UVOT observations until then.
