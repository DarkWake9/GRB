V. Mangano, B. Sbarufatti, V. LaParola, P. Romano (INAF-IASF PA)
and W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift started a second ToO observation of GRB 080507 (Lapshov et al.,
GCN Circ. 7697) on May 9th at 17:24 UT.
We have analyzed the 4 ks PC observation, and found that the brightest
uncatalogued source detected during the previous ToO observation
(Mangano et al., GCN Circ. 7699) has decayed from a rate level of
(1.4 +/- 0.2) e-2 counts s-1 to a level of (2.2 +/- 0.7) e-3 counts s-1.
The second uncatalogued source in the SuperAGILE error circle is
still visible at the constant level of (3.0 +/- 1.0) e-3 counts s-1.

We can confirm that the brightest source detected in Mangano et al.,
GCN Circ. 7699 is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 080507, in agreement with 
the observation reported by Kann et al. (GCN 7705).
