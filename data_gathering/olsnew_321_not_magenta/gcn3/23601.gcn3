We observed  the   optical afterglow (e.g. Podesta et al., GCN  23470; 
Kong  GCN 23475) of the INTEGRAL GRB 181201A  (Mereghetti et al., GCN 
23469)  with   Gemini-N telescope  on Dec. 22 in g'r'i'z and Dec. 24  in 
r'i'-filters.  Preliminary photometry of the OT is following.

2018-12-24  23.10793 r'     3*240  21.83  0.03

The photometry is based on the SDSS-DR12 star
SDSS-DR12_id           i'	r'
J211710.81-123706.3    16.257	16.517

Based on our previous observations and photometry reported in GCNs 
23475, 23478,  23486, 23504 we plot a light curve of the afterglow in 
r'-filter (http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB181201A/GRB181201A_optics_fit.png). 
Power law approximation of the LC before 2018-12-22 has an index of 
1.19 +/-0.01. The photometry obtained on 2018-12-22 and 2018-12-24 has a 
significance of about 2 and 6.5 sigma above the power law approximation. 
Additionally the i'-magnitude increases between  the two epochs. We can 
suggest that we observed the Supernova signature associated with GRB 
181201A.
