report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the reported LIGO/Virgo 
S190512at event (GCN #24503), trigger time T0=2019-05-12 18:07:14 UTC. 
At T0, more than 95% of the LIGO localization region was covered by 
the Insight-HXMT without occultation by the Earth.

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the GW counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales(1 s, 10 s) from the peak 
position of the LIGO-Virgo location probability map, the 5-sigma 
upper-limits fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1s:   2.6e-07 erg cm^-2
10s:  7.4e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1s:   3.6e-07 erg cm^-2
10s:  1.1e-06 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1s:   4.5e-07 erg cm^-2
10s:  1.9e-06 erg cm^-2

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
