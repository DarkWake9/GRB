P. Schady, V. Sudilovsky, J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) and T.Kruehler  
(DARK/NBI) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 120119A (Swift trigger 512035; Beardmore  
et al., GCN #12859) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner  
et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope at  
La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 04:08 UT, 3.5 min after the GRB trigger, and  
are continuing. They were performed at an average seeing of 0.9" and  
at an average airmass of 1.0.

We found a single point source consistent with the UVOT afterglow  
position.

Based on the first 2.4 min of total exposures in g'r'i'z' and 4 min in  
JHK, we estimate preliminary magnitudes (all in AB) of

g' = 18.8 +- 0.1 mag,
r' = 17.7 +- 0.1 mag,
i' = 16.8 +- 0.1 mag,
z' = 16.2 +- 0.1 mag,
J = 15.2 +- 0.1 mag,
H = 14.6 +- 0.1 mag and
K = 14.0 +- 0.1mag

Given magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS zeropoints as well as  
2MASS field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic  
foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.11 mag  
in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
