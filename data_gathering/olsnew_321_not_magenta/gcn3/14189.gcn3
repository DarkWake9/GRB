A. Goldstein (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 19:36:30.45 UT on 06 February 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray 
Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 130206A 
(trigger 381872193 /130206817) which was also detected by 
the Swift/BAT (De Pasquale et al. 2013, GCN 14181).  The GBM 
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of three overlapping pulses 
with a duration (T90) of about 91 s (50-300 keV). The 
time-averaged spectrum from T0=-1.5 s to T0+85.6 s is 
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.1 +/- 0.2 and 
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 132.6 +/- 34.0 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(3.3 +/- 0.4)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 
2.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
