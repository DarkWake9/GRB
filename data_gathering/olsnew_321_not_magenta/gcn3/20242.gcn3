TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

Tomoki Morokuma and Yuki Sarugaku (Univ. of Tokyo) report on behalf 
of　the OISTER collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161129A (Kocevski et al. GCN 20210) 
with　the 1.05-m Schmidt telescope and KWFC (Sako et al. 2012, Proc. 
SPIE　8446, 84466L) at Kiso Observatory in Japan. The observations were 
made　in z-band at 2016-11-29 08:15-08:36 (UT; about 1 hour after the 
burst). The flux is calibrated with z-band imaging data for a nearby 
SDSS field taken at almost the same airmass as that of the GRB field.

We do not detect any new source within the XRT error circle or at the 
position with Swift/UVOT and other telescopes' detections (e.g., Kuin et 
al. GCN 20217) and the upper limits are as follows.
