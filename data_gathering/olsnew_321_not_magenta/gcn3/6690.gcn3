The short hard GRB 070729 (Swift-BAT trigger #286373:
Guidorzi et al., GCN 6678; Sato et al., GCN 6681), triggered
Konus-A (Cosmos-2421) at T0=1554.9 s UT (00:25:54.9).

As observed by Konus-A the burst
had a fluence of 5.59(-4.38, +0.05)x10^-7 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.840 s
of 1.07(-0.92, +0.38)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

Preliminary analysis shows that
the time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0-1 s to T0) can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 1.08 (-0.36, +0.28)
and Ep = 467(-195, +848) keV (chi2 = 36/48 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
