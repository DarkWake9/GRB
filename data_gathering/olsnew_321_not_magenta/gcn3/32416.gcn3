The long GRB 220711B (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: Fermi GBM team,
GCN Circ. 32365; Fermi GBM Detection: Lesage et al., GCN Circ 32369; 
Swift detection: D'Ai et al., GCN Circ 32366, Swift-BAT refined analysis: 
Krimm et al.,  GCN Circ 32374) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 18:16:31.192 UTC on 11 July 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1341598587/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.  No real-time CGBM GCN
notice was distributed about this trigger because the real-time communication
from the ISS was off (loss of signal).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T-39.5 sec, peaks at T-2.4 sec, and ends at T+93.7 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 82.7 +/- 3.8 sec
and 15.7 +/- 4.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
