The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events consistent with the sky localization of GW candidate S190408an (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_l/S190408an.lvc) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-04-08 18:09:42.288 UTC to 2019-04-08 18:26:22.288 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the 90% spatial containment of S190408an calculated from the map circulated in the initial notice.

IceCube's sensitivity to point sources within the location spanned by the 90% spatial containment of S190408an ranges from
0.029 to 0.606 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
