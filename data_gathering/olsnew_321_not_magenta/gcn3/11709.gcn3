Veli-Pekka Hentunen, Markku Nissinen and Tuomo Salmi (Taurus Hill
Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

GRAS 011 (Global-Rent-a-Scope, Mayhill, New Mexico) CDK20 20 
inch (0.51 m) f/6.8 and FLI ProLine PL11002M CCD camera were used 
to detect GRB 110213A optical afterglow. The observations were started 
at 2011-02-13 05:39:52 (UT) and stopped at 2011-02-13 06:14:37 (UT). 
Two unfiltered and one photometric R observations with 600s exposure 
times were made. The afterglow was detected at following position 
RA 02:51:51.42 and DEC +49:16:23.7 consistent those given by Cenko 
S.B. et al. (GCN 11706) to within positional errors.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using 
NOMAD1 1392-0071642 (R = 15.230) as the comparison:

Tmid(s)+T0  Filter        Exp (sec)     Mag      Mag err   Limit
