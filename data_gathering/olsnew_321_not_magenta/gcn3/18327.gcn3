E. Mazaeva (IKI), R. Inasaridze (AAO), O. Kvaratskhelia(AAO), I. Molotov 
(KIAM), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150910A (Pagani et al., GCN  18264)  with 
AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory starting on Sep. 11 
(UT) 20:32:45. We obtained several unfiltered images. The afterglow 
(Pagani et al., GCN 18264; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 18265) is clearly 
visible in a combined image. The photometry of the combined image is 
following

2015-09-11 20:32:45    1.46327  none    49*120   21.55 +/- 0.08

The photometry is based on SDSS stars used in GCN 18281 (Mazaeva et 
al.), R magnitude deduced from Lupton's transformations.
