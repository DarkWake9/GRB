Giangiacomo Gandolfi on behalf of BeppoSAX Mission Scientist reports:

On July 4, 17:30:20 UT  a GRB (GRB990704) was detected
simultaneously by the GRBM and WFC of BeppoSAX.

Refined coordinates of GRB990704 are:
R.A.(2000)=184.79
DEC(2000)= -03.80

Due to the less-than-optimal attitude configuration the
error radius is of about 7'.

A follow-up with NFI is in progress.
