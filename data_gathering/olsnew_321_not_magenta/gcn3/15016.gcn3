Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130719A (trigger #562625) (Marshall,
et al., GCN Circ. 15012).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 89.038, -11.591 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  05h 56m 09.2s
    Dec(J2000) = -11d 35' 29.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single weak approximately FRED peak.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 177.7 +- 20.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+6.2 to T+205.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+82.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
