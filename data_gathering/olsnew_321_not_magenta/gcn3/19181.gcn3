Using the data set from T-691 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160313A (trigger #678929)
(A. D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 19171).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 183.821, 57.278 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 15m 17.0s
  Dec(J2000) = +57d 16' 40.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a complex structure with several
overlapping pulses. The structure starts at ~ T-5 s and ends at ~ T+45 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 42.6 +- 6.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.6 to T+44.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.36 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.8 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+24.79 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
