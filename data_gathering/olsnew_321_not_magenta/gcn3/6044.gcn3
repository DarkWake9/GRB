J. Haislip, D. Reichart, A. LaCluyze, K. Ivarsen, M. Nysewander, A. Foster, 
and J.A. Crain report:

Skynet observed the localization of GRB 070125 (Hurley et al., GCN 6024) 
with one of the 16-inch PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 20.3 hours 
after the burst in BVRI.  The afterglow candidate identified by Cenko and 
Fox (GCN 6028) is clearly visible in all filters.

We find the source to be R ~ 18.8 at a mean time of 21.8 hours after the 
burst calibrated to 10 USNO B1.0 stars.  Further observations are planned.
