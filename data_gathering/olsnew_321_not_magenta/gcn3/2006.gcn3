on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:



"We have performed VRI band observartions of the optical afterglow (GCN
1949) of the GRB 030323 (H2460; GCN 1956). For each band 30 x 45 s images
were obtained with the Gemini South 8.1 m Telescope (+Acquisition Camera),
as follows:


 BAND |  UT MAR 2003   |  MAG  |  ERROR(*)
-------------------------------------------
   V  | 27.135--27.161 | 23.04 | +/-0.03
   R  | 27.166--27.186 | 22.27 | +/-0.04
   I  | 27.186--27.205 | 21.78 | +/-0.05
-------------------------------------------
* Only statistical error.


The photometric calibration is based on the star located at
RA(J2000) = 11h 06m 08.82s, DEC(J2000) = -21º 46' 37.5", which has been
fixed at V = 18.97, R = 18.28 and I = 17.71 (GCN 1948).
