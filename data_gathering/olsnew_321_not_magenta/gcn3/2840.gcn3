" We have imaged the entire GRB 041211 error circle (Dezalay et al. GCN 2839) at 
Kiso (Japan), Lulin (Taiwan) and XingLong (China) observatory.

The observations are summarized as below:

Start time(UTC) Filter Exposure (sec)  Limit mag.   Site
                                        (SN=3)
Dec. 11.55        Rc     300 x 1          >~18      Kiso
Dec. 11.63        R      300 x 3          >~20      Lulin
Dec. 11.63        R      300 x 1          >~20    XingLong

Limiting magnitudes were estimated by comparison with several USNO-B1.0
stars.  Comparison with DSS II images, no new object was detected down
to the limiting magnitude."
