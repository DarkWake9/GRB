The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:


We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford

Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and Virgo

Observatory (V1) around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC)

candidate S190910d (GCN Circular 25695). Parameter estimation has

been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky map,

LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval

from the GraceDB event page:


https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190910d


The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. The 90%

credible region is 2482 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a

posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 632 +/- 186 Mpc (a posteriori

mean +/- standard deviation).


For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of

this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
