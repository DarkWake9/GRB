A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 05:52:33.73 UT on 26 January 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090126C (trigger 254641955 / 090126245).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 222.9, DEC = 39.2 (J2000 degrees,        
equivalent to 14h 52m, 39d 12'), with an uncertainty 
of 14.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 68 degrees.

Since this GRB is weak and short (~ 1 sec), the time-averaged 
spectrum is poorly constrained."
