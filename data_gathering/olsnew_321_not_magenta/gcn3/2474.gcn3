N. Schartel, B. Altieri report:


Preliminary analysis of the XMM-Newton raw data of
the GRB031203 field (D. Gotz et al. GCN 2459), based
on the fully accumulated 56.3 ks exposure time in the
EPIC pn camera, confirms the two sources reported by
M. Santos-Lleo and P. Calderon (GCN 2464). The
observation was performed under optimal environmental
conditions and is basically free from solar background
flares.


XMMU J080230.3-395101, (S1 in GCN 2464) shows a decrease
of the pn count rate from approximately 0.075 counts/sec
(at start of observation) to approximately 0.05
counts/sec (at end of observation) within an extraction
radius of 30 arcsec.
There are very few counts in low-energy channels
(below approximately 0.9 keV) which may be explained
by the Galactic absorption.


XMMU J080220.8-395213 (S2 in GCN 2464) might also show
evidence for a decrease in flux, but the current
processing status of the data does not allow proper
quantification.


In addition to the two sources reported in GCN 2464
several weaker sources are visible in the data taken
during the 56.3 ks exposure time. The following sources
are located in the INTEGRAL error circle:


XMM-Newton Source       counts          distance   in

The following sources fall on the border of the INTEGRAL
error circle:

XMM-Newton Source       counts          distance

XMMU J080241.7-394944   0.002+/-0.001   149
------------------------------------------------

The following source falls just outside the INTEGRAL
error circle:

XMM-Newton Source       counts          distance
                                         to centre
                         [1/sec]         [arcsec]
------------------------------------------------
XMMU J080226.6-395334   0.003+/-0.001   170
------------------------------------------------

At this stage of the data processing the position error
for the weaker sources is of the order of 10 arcsec.

The XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre plans to
make preliminary images available on a dedicated web
page by the middle of next week.
