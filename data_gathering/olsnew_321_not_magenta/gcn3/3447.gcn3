W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, reports:

"The robotic 0.76-m KAIT at Lick Observatory observed
XRF 050522 detected with INTEGRAL (Gotz et al., GCN 3446).
A series of 23 images were automatically obtained from
06:01:40 UT (79s after the burst) to 07:35:25 UT (5704s
after the burst), and were observed with a combination of
using V and I filters, and without filters. The images
were affected by the proximity of the GRB position to the 
bright moon. We did not detect a new object in our images
when compared to the DSS II images. Our first 15s V-band
exposure started at 79s after the burst has a limiting
magnitude of about 16.2 when compared to the USNO-B1.0 
catalog, while a 20s unfiltered image started at 130s
after the burst has a limiting mag of about 18.7. "
