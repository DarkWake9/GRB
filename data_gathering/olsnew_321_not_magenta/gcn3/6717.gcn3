report:

Skynet observed the localization of GRB 061121A (Page et al., GCN 5823) 
with two of the 16" PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 14.5 hours after 
the burst in r'i'z'.

We do not detect the afterglow (Page et al., GCN 5823) to 3-sigma limiting 
magnitudes of r' = 17.2 mag at a mean time of 14.7 hours after the burst 
(10 x 80 sec, calibrated to 13 stars), i' = 19.2 mag at a mean time of 16.3 
hours after the burst (75 x 80 sec, calibrated to 14 stars), and z' = 18.6 
(65 x 80 sec, calibrated to 21 stars) at a mean time of 16.4 hours after 
the burst.

Limiting magnitudes are calibrated to USNO B1.0 and NOMAD stars using the 
transformation equations of Smith et al. 2002, AJ, 123, 2121.
