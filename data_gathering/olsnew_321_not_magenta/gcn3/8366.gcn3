T. Augusteijn (NOT) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 081012 (Stroh et al.,
GCN 8361) from the 2.5m NOT telescope at Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory. A combination of 6x300s R-band
observations with mean time 23.79 UT (0.44 days after
the burst) did not show any source within the XRT error
box (Kennea & Stroh GCN 8364) down to a 3-sigma
limiting magnitude of R > 22.0. The images were moderately
contaminated by the light of the nearby Moon.

We thank the student group from the Mikkeli high school (Finland)
for help in carrying out the observations.
