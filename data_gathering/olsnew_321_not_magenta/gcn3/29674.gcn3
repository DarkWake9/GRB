We observed the field of GRB201216C (V. Lipunov et al., GCN 29062) with the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 12-16-2020 starting at 23:43:20.5 UT (T+36
mins).

We performed a series of exposures in R filter with a total exposure
of 2060 s. The weather conditions were very clear during the hours of
observation with an average arimass of 1.0.

We find no new source within the enhanced XRT position error circle
(S. Campana et al., 29064) and report the following 3-sigma upper limit:

T_mid       ||Exposure     ||Filter      ||Limit
T+ 1 hr      ||2060s           ||R            ||>20.65

The limit is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and is not
corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the commissioning
phase.
