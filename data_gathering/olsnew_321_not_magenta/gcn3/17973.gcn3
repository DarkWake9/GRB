Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150626A (trigger #646603)
(Roegiers, et al., GCN Circ. 17960).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 111.353, -37.803 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  07h 25m 24.8s 
  Dec(J2000) = -37d 48' 10.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows overlapping peaks starting at
~T-35 sec, peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+140 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) 
is 144 +- 66 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-47.30 to T+144.70 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.11 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+8.20 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
