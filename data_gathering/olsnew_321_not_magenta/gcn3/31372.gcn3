T. Laskar (Radboud U.) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31347) with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 97.5 GHz beginning on 2021
January 02 20:37:22 UT (39.5 h after the burst)

Preliminary analysis reveals a mm source with flux density of ~ 0.1 mJy at
position:

RA (J2000) = 00:05:24.80
Dec (J2000) = +31:46:08.41

with uncertainty ~ 0.03" in each coordinate, consistent with the X-ray
position (Osborne et al., GCN 31349) and optical position (Tohuvavohu et
al., GCN 31347; Hentunen et al., GCN 31356). Further observations are
planned.

We thank the JAO staff, AoD, P2G, and the entire ALMA team for their help
with these observations."
