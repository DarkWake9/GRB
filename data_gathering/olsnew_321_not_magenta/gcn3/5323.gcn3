TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5323
SUBJECT: GRB 060714, SMARTS optical/IR afterglow observation
DATE:    06/07/15 20:38:34 GMT
FROM:    Bethany Cobb at Yale U  <cobb@astro.yale.edu>

B. E. Cobb (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 060714
(GCN 5311, Krimm et al.) with a mid-exposure time of 2006-07-15 01:18 UT
(~10.1 hours post-burst). Total summed exposure times amounted to
36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The afterglow of GRB 060714 (GCN 5311, Krimm et al.) is well-detected
in the I-band, but only marginally detected in J.  The following
preliminary photometry was calibrated using several USNO-B1.0
stars in the I-band and several 2MASS standards in J.  The
I-band error is dominated by the error in the photometric
calibration, while the error in the J-band in dominated
by the error in the afterglow measurement.
