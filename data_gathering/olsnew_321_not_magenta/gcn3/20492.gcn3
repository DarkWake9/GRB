We observed the sky area corresponding to 49% probability of initial LIB
skymap for the advanced LIGO trigger G270580 with Mini-MegaTORTORA
nine-channel wide-field monitoring system (located at Special Astrophysical
Observatory near Russian 6-m telescope) between 2017-01-20 15:05:45 UT (2.6
hours since trigger) and 2017-01-20 19:31:28 UT (7.0 hours since trigger)
under varying weather condition.
Observations consisted of several pointings with 10 x 60 s unfiltered
exposures each in every channel, covering roughly 900 square degrees
simultaneously. Image of the total sky coverage is available at
http://mmt.favor2.info/scheduler/1436/lvc
The footprints of acquired images are uploaded to GraceDB.

Quick-look analysis did not reveal any transient brighter than V~13.5
magnitude in the data.
