On night starting 22rd of October we scheduled observations from our observatory Pi of the Sky South located in San Pedro de Atacama in Chile. The observations are performed with two cameras: one observing in R filter and one with wide-band White filter. Two expositions times are used 10s and 100s. For 10s exposition time we expect limiting brightness 12mag, and 13mag for 100s. Each exposition taken cover area of approximately plus/minus 10 deg from coordinates set on center of the frame. For observations related to G194575 we are using following pointings:

1) 0.889 h 2.29 deg
2) 0.558 h -2.71 deg

On first night 100 images were taken from both cameras. Each image taken covers approximately 400 square degrees. We are currently analyzing taken images.

We continue observations during following nights.
