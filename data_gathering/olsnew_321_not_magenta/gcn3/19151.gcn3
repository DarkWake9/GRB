I.A. Smith (Rice U.), N.R. Tanvir (U. of Leicester), and Y. Urata (NCU) 
report:

We observed the location of the possibly short GRB 160303A (Beardmore 
et al., GCN Circ. 19126) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum 
camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started 
at 11:56 UT on 2016-03-03, corresponding to 62 minutes after the burst
trigger.  Exposures totaling 2.0 hours were made in good weather
conditions.  No source was detected, with the RMS background noise
being 1.4 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 14.8 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Callie Matulonis and Iain Coulson for the prompt support 
of these observations that were taken under project M16AP005.
