Using the data set from T-239 to T+240 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191029A (trigger #932058)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 26088).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 352.140, -40.464 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  23h 28m 33.6s 
  Dec(J2000) = -40d -27' -49.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a pair of weak pulses spanning the period 
from approximately T-5 to T+35 seconds. T90 (15-350 keV) is 39.5 +- 7.9 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.05 to T+45.85 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.90 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
