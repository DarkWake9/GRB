Senior High School), J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 201014A (Swift trigger =1000255, Ambrosi et 
al., GCN 28623) using the NEXT-0.6m optical telescope located at 
Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations automatically started at 22:52:30 
UT on 2020-10-14, i.e., 232 s after the BAT trigger, and 3x40s, 4x60s, 
12x90s frames in the Sloan r-filter were obtained.

The optical afterglow (Pozanenko et al., GCN 28628; de Ugarte Postigo et 
al, GCN 28650) inside the enhanced XRT position (D'Elia et al. GCN 
28626) is weakly detected in our stacked image, with r = 20.9 +/- 0.3 at 
T-mid = 0.324 hr after the BAT trigger, calibrated with nearby 
Pan-STARRS stars.
