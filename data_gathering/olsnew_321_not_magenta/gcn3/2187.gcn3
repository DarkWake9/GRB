K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) also observed this burst (GCN 2183).  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 75 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.  Because this
event was quite weak, these parameters are uncertain by a factor of
about 2.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 332.536, -37.604 degrees, whose radius is 61.259 +/-  0.294
degrees (3 sigma ).  This annulus is consistent with, but does not
constrain, the IBIS localization given in GCN 2183.

This annulus may be improved.
