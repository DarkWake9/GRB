G. Stratta, M. Perri, M. L. Conciatore (ASDC), D. N. Burrows (PSU) and
G. Sato (GSFC/ISAS) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The field of the short hard BAT GRB 070209 (Sato et al., GCN Circ. 6086)
has been re-observed by Swift in two epochs at about T+5 days and T+9
days after the BAT trigger. The XRT exposures in Photon Counting mode
were 19.4 ks and 22.8 ks, respectively. We found no X-ray sources within
the BAT refined error circle (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 6087). The three
X-ray sources reported by Stratta et al. (GCN Circ. 6095) close to the
BAT error circle are still detected at the same count rate level of the
first follow-up observation. We conclude that none of these sources is
the afterglow of the burst.

The three sigma upper limit on the 0.7-10 keV count rate during the first
observation within the BAT error circle was about 7e-4 cts/s. Assuming an
absorbed power-law spectral model with Galactic NH (2.3e20 cm-2) and a
photon index of 2 this corresponds to an observed 0.7-10 keV flux of
about 3e-14 erg cm-2 s-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
