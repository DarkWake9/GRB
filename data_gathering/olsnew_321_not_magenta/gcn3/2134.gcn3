TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2134
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030410 (annulus)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Konus and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this ~300 ms long burst at
41022 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered at RA, Decl (2000) = 216.716, -15.670 degrees, whose
radius is 59.394 +/-  2.469 degrees (3 sigma).  As this annulus does
not include any of the known SGRs, this event is probably a
short/hard GRB.

As this burst was not observed by Ulysses or Mars Odyssey,
it will not be possible to derive a small error box for it.
