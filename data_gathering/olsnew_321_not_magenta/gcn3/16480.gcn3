J. Wang,  H. L. Li,   X. H. Han and C. Wu, H. Liu on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB 140629A (Lien et al. GCN  16477)  
with Xinglong  0.8-m TNT telescope at 14:27:11 (UT) , 
581 sec after the burst. The observations are continued for 1.6 hours.

The optical counterpart reported by (Lien et al.  GCN 16477;  
Yurkov et al., GCN 16478) was clearly detected in multi-wavelength images. 
The brightness of the  optical emission is decaying from 14.7mag 
to 17.8 mag in R band. The decay slope is  estimated to be about 1.2 
in our observation epoch.
