E.Pavlenko  and V.Rumyantsev (on behalf of Crimean Observatory and Space
Research Institute (Moscow) GRB follow-up teams) report:

"We have imaged of the error box for GRB 020124 / HETE #1896(GCN #1220) 
with the 0.60-m Zeiss telescope of Crimean Laboratory of SAI
(field 5x7 arcminutes). 

We obtained several frames which include the center of error box
and partially covered its arrea at 2002 Jan. 24 20h54m46s - 23h32m43s UT. 

We have observed the field noted in GCN1221 on 2002 Jan. 24 22h05m02s UT 
(i.e. GRB time + 11.5h). No new objects are seen within this frame 
(as well as within the rest frames) when comparing 
to the DSS-2 (R-band), brighter a limiting R magnitude of 18.5mag.
