In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190510g at T0 = 2019-05-10
02:59:39.292 UTC (GCN #24442 including an updated localization) a
preliminary
analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 showed that about 60% of the S190510g
90% c.l. localization region (LR) was exposed at off-axis angles between 25
and 75 deg by the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV
over three time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of the
S190510g 90% c.l. LR was available. No candidate gamma-ray transient was
detected.

The following preliminary GRID 3-sigma upper limit (UL) values are obtained:

(T0 - 2s; T0 + 2s): from 7.4e-07 to 1.7e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(T0 - 10s; T0 + 10s): from 1.5e-07 to 3.5e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(T0; T0 + 100s): from 4.2e-08 to 1.8e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1

An image of the AGILE-GRID exposure near T0 is available at the site

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
