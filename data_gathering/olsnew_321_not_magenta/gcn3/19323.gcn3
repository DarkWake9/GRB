Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 160417A (trigger #683076) (D'Avanzo, et al.,
GCN Circ. 19316).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 120.260, 7.646 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 01m 02.4s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 38' 45.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 41%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peak episode
starting ~T-4 sec, and ending around ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 15 +- 2 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.14 to T+13.89 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.93 +- 0.24.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 5.9 +- 0.8 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.51 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
