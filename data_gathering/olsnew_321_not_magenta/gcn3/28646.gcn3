J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) and C. Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:27:49.59 UT on 16 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 201016A (trigger 624500874 / 201016019).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data,
is RA = 174.3, DEC = -2.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent
to 11h 37m, -2d 00'), with an uncertainty of 1.0 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally a 
systematic error which we have characterized as a mixture of two Gaussians,
one with a radius of 1.8 degrees (52% contribution) and one with a radius 
of 4.1 degrees (47% contribution) [A. Goldstein et al. 2020, ApJ, 895, 1] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 93 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple pulses with a duration (T90)
of about 3 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0+6.3 s to T0+9.4 s is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 181 +/- 2 keV,
alpha = -0.42 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.75 +/- 0.03

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.06 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+6.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 267.4 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
