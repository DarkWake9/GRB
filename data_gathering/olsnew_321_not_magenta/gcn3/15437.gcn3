We observed the field of GRB 131018B (Vianello, et al., GCN 15357; 
Zhang, et
al., GCN 15360) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera 
(RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/10 20.09 to
2013/10 20.27 UTC (33.94 to 38.36 hours after the GBM trigger),  and again
the next night from 2013/10 21.09 to 2013/10 21.27 UTC (57.93 to 62.34
hours after the GBM trigger). We obtained a total of 2.8 hours exposure 
in the
r and i bands and 1.3 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands each 
night.

During the 1st night of observations, the position of the X-ray afterglow
reported by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 15361, 15431) falls at the edge of our 
field
of view in the Z and J bands. For a source within the Swift-XRT error 
circle, in
comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

   Z   > 22.6
   J    > 21.6

During the 2nd night of observations, the XRT position was observed in all
filters. For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison 
with 2MASS
and SDSS DR9, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

   r   > 23.8
   i   > 23.5
   Z  > 22.8
   Y  > 22.2
   J   > 21.9
   H  > 21.4

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
