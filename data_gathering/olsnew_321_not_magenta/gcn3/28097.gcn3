The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:52:16 UT on 14 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200714D (trigger 616434741.793704 / 200714661).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 13.7, Dec = 31.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 54m, 31d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 28.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 36.0 degrees.
