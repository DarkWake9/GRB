B. Sbarufatti (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester),
T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 07:04:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220623A (trigger=1111672).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 145.462, +75.828 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 09h 41m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = +75d 49' 42"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 25 sec. One peak occurred before 
the trigger and another occurred at the trigger time.  The peak count 
rate was ~9000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+61.4
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (bxs60 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
