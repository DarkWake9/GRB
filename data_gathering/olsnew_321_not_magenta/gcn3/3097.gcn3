K. Hurley (UCB) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050315 at 20:59:42 UT on 15 March 
2005 (Parsons et al 2005, GCN 3094).  The observatory executed an automated 
slew to the BAT position and the XRT began taking data at 21:01:05.5 
UT.  The XRT was in Manual state and made observations in Photon Counting 
mode.  Data were dumped to the ground at about 00:00 UT on 16 March 2005 
and a preliminary analysis was performed by the XRT team.  We find a bright 
uncataloged, rapidly fading X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 20:25:54,
Dec(J2000) = -42:36:0.2

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds.   This source is 32 
arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3094.
