SUBJECT: GRB 180329B: NOT optical afterglow detection
DATE:    18/03/29 23:19:12 GMT

D. A. Perley (LJMU), K. E. Heintz (Univ. of Iceland and DAWN/NBI), and
D. Malesani (DAWN/NBI and DARK/NBI) report:

We observed the location of GRB 180329B (Racusin et al., GCN 22558)
using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC
imaging camera.  Three exposures of 300 s each were obtained in the SDSS
r filter.  Observations were taken during twilight at low elevation, and
the field was partially vignetted due to the dome shutter.

A weak source is detected in each exposure at a position coincident with
the Swift UVOT and XRT error circles. We estimate a magnitude of m(r) =
19.4 +/- 0.2 mag at the time of our observations (midpoint UT 20:27:14),
corresponding to 6.32 hr after trigger.

The position of the afterglow (J2000) is:
RA =  05:31:36.90
Dec = -23:41:26.3
    (+/- 0.4")

We thank the NOT staff (J. Telting) and the observer (L. Siltala) for
acquiring these observations.
