report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:17:54.53 UT on 21 April 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220421A (trigger 672221879/220421346), which was
also 
detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (Raman et al. 2022, GCN 31934)

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 74.4, DEC = 23.1 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 04 h 57 m, 23 d 06 '), with a statistical uncertainty
of 2.1 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 59
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90) of about 6.4
s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.002 s to T0+7.008 s is best fit by a
Band function 
with Epeak = 133.20 +/- 5.40 keV, alpha = -0.41 +/- 0.05, and beta = -2.48
+/- 0.11

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.2 +/- 0.2)E-06. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.056 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 13.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
