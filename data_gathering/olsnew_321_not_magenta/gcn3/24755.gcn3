The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:22:27 UT on 5 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190605A (trigger 581469752.117826 / 190605974).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 337.2, Dec = 4.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 28m, 4d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 85.0 degrees.
