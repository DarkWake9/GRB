NUMBER:  17137
SUBJECT: GRB 141205A Short hard GRB found in ground analysis of BAT data

J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift science team:

At 08:05:17, BAT triggered on GRB 141205A (trigger 620534). No source was
found onboard. A significant source was found in ground analysis at
RA, Dec 92.881, +37.862, which is:

RA (J2000)   06h 11m 31.5s
Dec (J2000)  37d 51' 43"

with an estimated position uncertainty of 3 arcmin radius.

This was the same event as Fermi GBM trigger 439459520. The BAT position is
14.0 degrees from the GBM final position (4.4 degree radius 1 sigma error).

The burst was about 1 second long.

A Swift TOO has been requested.
