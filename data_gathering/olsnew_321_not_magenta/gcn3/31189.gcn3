Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 211207A (trigger #1088376)
(Ambrosi et al., GCN 31182).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec
= 149.601, -24.360 deg which is

   RA(J2000)  =  09h 58m 24.1s

   Dec(J2000) = -24d 21' 37.3"

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The
partial coding was 62%.



The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about 4
sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.73 +- 0.87 sec (estimated error including
systematics).



The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.30 to T+2.97 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.72 +- 0.30.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-07
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.15 sec in the 15-150
keV band is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
