No.1 Senior High School), J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 201026A (Cenko et al., GCN 28784) using the 
NEXT-0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. 
Observations automatically started at 22:49:35 UT on 2020-10-26, i.e., 
12 min after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s, 4x60 s and 12x90 s 
frames in the Sloan r-filter.

No new optical source is detected in our stacked image at the XRT 
position, down to a limiting magnitude of r = 20.5, calibrated with the 
nearby Pan-STARRS field.
