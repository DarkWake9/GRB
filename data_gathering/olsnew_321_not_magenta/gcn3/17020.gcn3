TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  17020
SUBJECT: GRB 141102A found in ground analysis of BAT data

J. R. Cummings on behalf of the Swift science team:

A possibly short burst occurred at 12:51:40 UT (BAT trigger 617313).  No source was found
onboard.  Ground analysis shows a significant source at RA, Dec 208.614, -47.100 which is:

RA (J2000)     13h 54m 27.4s
Dec (J2000)    -47d 06' 00"

with an estimated uncertainty of 4 arcmin radius, 90% containment.

There were multiple peaks, at about T-0.2, T+0.4, T+1.7, and T+2.3. The latter two
were stronger than the first two and resembled them in shape, the third was the largest.
T90 is estimated as 2.5 +- 0.4 sec.

The spectrum from T-0.3 to T+2.7 seconds is best fit by a simple powerlaw function with
a photon index of 1.3 +- 0.5.  The fluence was 3.7 x 10 ^-7 ergs/cm^2.

A Swift TOO is not possible because the source is too close to the Sun for the next
39 days.
