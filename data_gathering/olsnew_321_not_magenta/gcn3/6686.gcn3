E. Berger, D. Murphy (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"We imaged the position of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 070729 (GCNs 
#6681,6682) with the Swope 40-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory 
starting on 2007 July 29.385 UT.  A total of 3600 sec were obtained in 
R-band.  We do not detect any sources within the XRT error circle, 
including the possible host galaxy detected in K-band with Magellan (GCN 
#6680).  The 3-sigma limit is R>21.8 mag, indicating that the putative 
host is red, with R-K>3.6 mag."
