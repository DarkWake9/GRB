J.S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley), H.-W. Chen (U 
Chicago), an d J.X. Prochaska (UCO/Lick) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 070925 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 6823) in
r-band with the Gemini South 8-m telescope for a total of 900 sec
starting at 2007-09-26 00:00:59 UT.  The stacked image has a mean seeing
of ~ 1.0 arcsec.  Within the XRT (Vetere et al. GCN 6826) there are two
apparent binary systems, both apparent in DSS imaging (mid-points
16:52:52.5, -22:01:41 and 16:52:52.1, -22:01:41). We detect no other
sources in the error circle to r~24.5.
