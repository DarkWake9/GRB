  We took a series of Y-band photometry calibration data
  for the field of GRB090423 using the 1.0m telescope at
  Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) operated by the Korea Astronomy
  Space Science Institute.

   For the Y-band photometry standards, we used P239-C and
  GD140 from UKIRT faint standards, and HIP 50459, a A0V star
  from Hipparcos catalog. The zero points obtained for
  these standards are applied to our observation of
  the GRB090423 field, yielding Y-band photometry (Vega) for
  objects in the GRB field down to Y(MKO) ~ 17.5 magnitude at 10-sigma.
  The expected zero point accuracy is ~0.1mag.
  To derive AB mag, add 0.63 mag to the values listed in
  the catalog.

  The calibration data and finding charts are available at

  We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for his assistance for this
  observation.
