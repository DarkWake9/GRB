Using the data set from T-152 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140430A (trigger #597722)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 16190).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 102.942, 23.033 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 51m 46.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 01' 58.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several well separated peaks.
The first (and brightest) starts at ~T-1 sec, peaks at ~T+4 sec,
and ends at ~T+9 sec.  The 2nd and 3rd peaks peak at ~T+30 and ~T+180,
respectively.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 173.6 +- 3.7 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.30 to T+177.58 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.00 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
