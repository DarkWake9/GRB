We observed the field of GRB 180111A (Lien, et al., GCN 22318) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/01 12.21 to 2018/01 12.56 UTC (12.35 to
20.68 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.31 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 2.22 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

We find a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans, et al., 22319).
In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we measure:

 r = 20.90 +/- 0.10
 i = 20.41 +/- 0.10
 Z = 20.61 +/- 0.15
 Y = 20.41 +/- 0.15

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  We note that there is an r=22.7
mag SDSS source, perhaps the host galaxy, within the XRT error region and
at a position consistent with our source position.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
