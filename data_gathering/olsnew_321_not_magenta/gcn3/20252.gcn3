report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope automatically began observing INTEGRAL GRB 
161214A (Mereghetti et al., GCN 20251) in the SDSS r. Within the 
INTEGRAL error circle we find an uncatalogued fading object at the 
following position:

RA(J2000)=  12:43:00.36
Dec(J2000)= +06:51:50.1

with a 1 arcsec error radius and magnitudes of r=19.66 +- 0.07 at 35 
minutes, and r=19.95 +- 0.07 at 61 minutes post GRB trigger as 
calibrated against nearby SDSS stars.
