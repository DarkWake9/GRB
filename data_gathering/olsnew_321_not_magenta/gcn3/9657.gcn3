Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view towards the
GRB 090709A (GCN 9625) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Jul. 10.46
UT and Jul. 11.42 UT, and at a frequency of 1.43 GHz on 2009 Jul. 11.39
UT. The GRB radio afterglow is undetected at the PAIRITEL NIR afterglow
position (GCN 9635). The peak flux at the GRB afterglow position on 11th
July observations is 62+/-35 uJy in 8.46 GHz band and 79+/-144 uJy at
1.43 GHz band.
