P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 190615B, which was also detected by Insight-HXMT/HE (Luo Q. et al., GCN #24843).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple pulses of emission with the strongest peak at 14:42:23.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 946 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 4318 cts. The local mean background count rate was 640 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 27.9 s. 

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
