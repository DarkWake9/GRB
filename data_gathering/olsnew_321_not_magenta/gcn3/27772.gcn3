We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 200519A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 
27756) with the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) located at the 
Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, India. The observations started 
on 2020-05-19 (20:10:35 UT) under good sky conditions and three 
consecutive frames (120, 240, and 240 sec) in Bessell R-band were 
obtained. The OT candidate (Kong et al., GCN 27757, Strausbaugh et al., 
GCN 27759, Hu et al., GCN 27760, Kumar et al., GCN 27764, Kumar et al. 
GCN 27767, Siegel & Sbarufatti, GCN 27769) is clearly detected in each 
frame. The preliminary photometry is performed relative to the USNO-B1.0 
catalogue. The initial magnitude of the OT is 19.70 +- 0.10 (uncorrected 
for the galactic extinction).

We thank the observing staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the 
observations.
