V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB 
  follow-up collaboration:

We observed of  the field of  the Swift GRB 130610A (Cummings et al.,
GCN 14842) with Shajn telescope of CrAO starting on June, 10 (UT)
19:03:05. Several exposures of 120 s were obtained in R-filter. In the
combined image we clearly detected bright point-like source
superimposed on an extended object. Coordinates of the bright object
(J2000) 14 57 40.85 +28 12 25.5 (uncertainty of 0.2" in both
coordinates)  coincide with the afterglow coordinates (Cummings et al.,
GCN 14842; Melandri et al., GCN 14843). The extended object could be a
host galaxy with brightness of R ~ 23.8.

Preliminary photometry might be biasedby the extended object and  based 
  on the USNO B1.0 star 1182-0253576 14 57 45.41 +28 12 57.7 assuming 
R=18.98:
