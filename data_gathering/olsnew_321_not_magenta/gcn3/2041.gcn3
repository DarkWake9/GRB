TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2041
SUBJECT: GRB 030329, optical photometry
DATE:    03/03/31 05:22:25 GMT
FROM:    Peter Garnavich at U of Notre Dame  <pgarnavi@miranda.phys.nd.edu>

K.Z. Stanek (CfA), P. Martini (OCIW) and P. Garnavich (Notre Dame) 

Images of the GRB 030329 afterglow (Peterson & Price: GCN
1985; Torii: GCN 1986) were obtained with the Magellan 6.5-m
Clay telescope beginning March 31.068 (UT). Four 30-sec exposures
were taken in the R-band with the LDSS2 imaging/spectrograph.
Using the calibration by Henden (GCN 2023) for "star A" (GCN 2012)
at 10:44:42 +21:32:31 (2000) of R=16.06, we find the brightness
of the afterglow is R=16.21 +/- 0.05.

This is nearly a magnitude brighter than expected from the
extrapolation of a powerlaw decay slope of -1.9 found around
16 hours after the burst by Garnavich, Stanek & Berlind (GCN 2018),
Smith (GCN 2019) and Halpern et al. (GCN 2021). Apparently, a
more shallow decay has reappeared as reported by Lipkin et al.
(GCN 2034).

We combined the Clay images, taken in 1" seeing, and subtracted
the afterglow point-spread function but no evidence of the
host galaxy was detected.
