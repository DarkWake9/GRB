The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:44:36 UT on 10 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220610A (trigger 676590281.930348 / 220610906).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 160.7, Dec = 24.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 42m, 24d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
