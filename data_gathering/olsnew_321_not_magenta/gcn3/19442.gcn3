S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
L.Di Gesu' (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 160 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 03:37:20 UT of May 21, 2016.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  129.7108
DEC.=    46.9142
with an uncertainty of    1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.8 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 1.2e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
