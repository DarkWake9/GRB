The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:


On 2022-09-07 at 06:46:47.52 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with 
a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was 
selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream. The average 
astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has 
an estimated false alarm rate of 0.46 events per year due to atmospheric 
backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the 
time of detection.


After the initial automated alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/137019_70165712.amon), 
more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, 
with the direction refined to:


Date: 2022-09-07

Time: 06:46:47.52 UT

RA: 224.81 (+2.07 / -1.95 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

Dec: +44.70 (+0.94 / -1.06 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000


We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help 
identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.


There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty 
region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL 
J1504.6+4343 at RA: 226.16, Dec: 43.72 deg (1.38 deg away from the 
best-fit event position).


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
