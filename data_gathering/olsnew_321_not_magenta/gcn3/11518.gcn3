R. Chornock and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We obtained 4x1800s of spectroscopy of the host galaxy candidate (Perley 
et al., GCN 11464; Cenko et al., GCN 11468; Chornock et al., GCN 11469) 
found in the XRT error circle of the short-hard GRB 101219A (Gelbord et 
al., GCN 11461) using GMOS on Gemini-North starting on January 2.25 UT. 
  Observations were obtained with the R400 grating, covering 5890-10100 
Angstroms in nod-and-shuffle mode.  The galaxy spectrum exhibits 
emission lines due to [O II] 3727 Angs and [O III] 5007 Angs at a 
redshift of 0.718.
