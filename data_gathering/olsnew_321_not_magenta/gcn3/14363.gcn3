SUBJECT: GRB 130408A: Swift/UVOT Detection of the Optical Afterglow
DATE:    13/04/09 00:21:52 GMT
FROM:    Mike Siegel at PSU/Swift MOC  <siegel@swift.psu.edu>

M. H. Siegel (PSU) and A. Y. Lien (NASA/GSFC/ORAU) report on behalf
of the UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 155 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
 RA(J2000)  =	08:57:37.30 = 134.40540
 DEC(J2000) = -32:21:38.9  = -32.36081
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.5 arc sec. This position is 8.4
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
16.82 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.04. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.26.
