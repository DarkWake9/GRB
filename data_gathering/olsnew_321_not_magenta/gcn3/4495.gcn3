TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4495
SUBJECT: GRB 060111B: TAROT optical observation
DATE:    06/01/12 14:22:29 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060111B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 176918) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 28s after the GCN trigger
(8s after the notice). The field elevation decreased
from 28 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detected the OT source mentioned by Yost et al.
(GCNC 4488) at the position (+/- 0.6 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 19 05 42.46
DEC(J2000.0) +70 22 32.3

OT was R~13.8 at 28s after GRB with a fading rate
t^-1.74 (+/-0.1) until 200s.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1
star: 1603-125792 (R=15.00).
