S. B. Cenko and A. Rau (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of GRB 060904a (Grupe et al; GCN 5502)
with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations began at
4:57 UT 4 September (3.9 hours after the burst) and consisted of 12 x 180
s images in the Kron R and Sloan i' and z' filters.  We find no sources
inside the XRT error circle, to a limiting magnitude of R > 22.0
(estimated by comparison with several USNO-B objects in the field).
