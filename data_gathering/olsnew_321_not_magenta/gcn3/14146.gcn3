Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130122A (trigger #546731)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 14140).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 194.307, 59.003 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 57m 13.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +59d 00' 09.2" 
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 89%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single roughly FRED-like peak
starting at ~T+0 sec, peaking at ~T+10 sec, and ending at ~T+100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 64 +- 36 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.6 to T+67.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.4 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+10.92 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
