TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1778
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021223 (two large error boxes)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-
Wind GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. 
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and RHESSI observed this burst at 04195 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~6 s, a 25-100 keV fluence
of ~4E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of ~9E-7 erg/cm2 s.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl(2000)= 182.709, 36.685 degrees, with radius 60.238 +/-
0.27 degrees (3 sigma).

In addition, the Konus response limits the arrival direction to 
ecliptic latitudes between +55 and +75 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl=257, +32 and 269, +52,
and between RA, Decl=304, +78 and 62, +77.

This annulus can be improved and/or constrained further, but
as this event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error
box cannot be obtained for it.
