A. M. Soderberg and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Using the VLA at 4.9 GHz, we imaged the entire IPN error box
(GCN#2443) of GRB 031111 (HETE Trigger 2924) on November 14.52 UT
with the Very Large Array. The typical rms noise on the image was
was 77 uJy.  We detect no sources greater than 5 sigma inside the
error region. No further observations are planned."
