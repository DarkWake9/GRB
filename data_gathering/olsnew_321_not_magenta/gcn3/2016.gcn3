F. Mallia, U. Tagliaferri (Osservatorio Astronomico di Campo Catino, Italy),
B. L. Jensen and J. Hjorth (University of Copenhagen),
M. I. Andersen (Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam) report: 


We imaged the field around the OT located by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and 
Torii (GCN 1986), using the Campo Catino Automated Telescope (0.4-m f/8) + 
CCD (unfiltered, but peaking in the red part of the spectrum) on Mar 29.9621 
UT. The source was bright and our astrometry provided a position in 
excellent agreement with that in GCN 1994 (Uemura et al.). Using the R 
magnitudes for the USNO SA2.0 stars in the field, we obtained a preliminary 
magnitude of CR = 14.5.
