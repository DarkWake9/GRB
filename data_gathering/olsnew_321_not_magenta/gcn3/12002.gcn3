report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 110503A (Stamatikos et al.
GCNC11991) with the Submillimeter Array (SMA, Hawaii, U.S.A.).
Observations were performed at 217GHz (1.4 mm) using 5 antennas under
unstable weather conditions (optical depth at 225 GHz ~0.25, humidity
~50%). The GRB field was observed for 268 minutes (on-source), starting at
1:15 UT, with mean epoch on 4 May at 5:36 UT, 12.0 hours after the burst.
We do not detect any significant flux at the position of the optical
afterglow, imposing a 3-sigma detection limit of 5.1 mJy.

[GCN OPS NOTE(05may11): Per author's request, the burst name
in the Subject-line was corrected.]
