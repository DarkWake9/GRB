E. Palazzi, N. Masetti (ITESRE, CNR, Bologna), A. Magazzu, M. Pedani, 
S. Benetti (TNG) and E. Pian (OATs, Trieste), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:


"We acquired optical B-band images of the central part of the GRB000830
error box (Hurley et al., GCN #779) on 2000 Aug. 31.99, Sep. 2.03 and 
Sep. 3.16 UT (i.e. 24, 49 and 76 hours after the GRB) with TNG+Dolores. 
The total exposure time was 15 minutes for each epoch. Seeing was 
1.2, 1.1 and 1.5 arcsec on the three epochs, respectively. The pointings
covered about 75% of the GRB error box.

Photometric calibration was performed using USNO-A2.0 catalog stars.
No new object brighter than the DSS-II limit is detected inside the GRB
error box in any of the three images (note however that the DSS-II plates
are in the R-band filter).
Also, the comparison between pairs of epochs does not reveal any object
with significant brightness variation down to a 3-sigma limiting
magnitude B ~ 24.0.".
