TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2340
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030731 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this event at 18872 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 40 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 157.884,  25.534 degrees, whose radius is 78.920 +/-  0.152
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
