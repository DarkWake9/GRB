D. Fugazza, A. Melandri (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of GRB 160325A (Sonbas et al., GCN 19222) with the 
60-cm robotic telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile).
The observations started at 07:01:08 UT, 65 seconds after the Burst, and 
were carried out simultaneously with in the g, r, i, z and H bands.
An uncatalogued bright source in the XRT error box is detected at the 
coordinates:

RA(2000) =   01:02:36.06
Dec(2000) = -72:41:47.7

with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 0.7 arcsec.
A very preliminary photometry indicates it was H ~10.71 +/- 0.01 about 
270 sec after the burst.

Further observations are in progress to assess its variability.
