G. G. Williams (MMTO) and P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory), on behalf of 
the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope was manually triggered and began 
observing the error box of GRB 060510B (Swift Trigger 209352, GCN 5096) at 
08:50:00.7 UT, ~28 minutes after the burst.  Our initial observations 
include 5 x 10s exposures, 5 x 20s exposures, and 30 x 60s exposures, all 
in the R-band.

We do not detect the afterglow reported by Mirabal et al. (GCN 5097) or 
any other new source within the XRT error box in our first several 
60-second exposures to the following 3-sigma limiting magnitude estimated 
using nearby USNO-B1.0 stars:

t obs (UT)	exp t (s)	t-t_0 (s)	Limit
--------------------------------------------------------
08:53:41	60 		1877 		R > 18.6

Additional observations and analysis are ongoing.
