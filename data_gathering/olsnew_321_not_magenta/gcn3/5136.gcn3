P.A.Milne and G.G.Williams (Steward Obs) on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS GRB team report:
                                                                                
We observed the field of GRB 060515 with the 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope 
at Kitt Peak, AZ. in response to SWIFT trigger 210084. Due to twilight, 
the first usable images were obtained ~30 minutes after the GRB. In a 
co-added R-band image produced from eight 60 second exposures, we do 
not detect the candidate optical counterpart reported by Klotz, Boer, 
& Atteia (GCN 5134) or any other candidate counterpart.  The central 
time of the co-added image is 03:03 UT (1745 seconds after the GRB) 
and the 3-sigma limiting magnitude is 18.1.
                                                                            This message may be cited.
