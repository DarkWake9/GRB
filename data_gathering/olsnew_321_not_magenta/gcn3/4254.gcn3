W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB051111 detected with Swift
(Trigger 163438; Sakamoto et al. GCN 4248).  A series of
images was automatically obtained starting at 06:00:25 UT
(44s after the burst). The sequence includes a combination of
images taken with the V and I filters, as well as some that
are unfiltered. The OT identified by W. Rujopakarn et al. (GCN
4247) was detected with the following unfiltered magnitudes
(calibrated to USNO B1.0):

UT Start      EXP time   R mag   delta R

06:00:25       15 s      13.40   0.05
06:01:46       20 s      14.32   0.05

Observations and analysis are continuing.
