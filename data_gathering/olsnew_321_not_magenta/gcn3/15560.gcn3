The late X-ray observations of GRB 060614 (A. M. Parsons et al., GCN 5252) by Swift-XRT clearly evidence a pattern typical of a family of GRBs associated to supernova (SN) following the Induced Gravitational Collapse (IGC) paradigm (1,2). By overlapping the X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity light curve of GRB 060614 with the one of GRB 090618, namely the IGC GRB-SN prototype (3), we estimate a theoretical redshift of z=1.2 (see Fig. 1 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB060614_Fig1.pdf), much higher than z=0.125 of the purported host galaxy (Price et al., GCN 5275; Fugazza et al., GCN 5276). This leads to the explanation of the absence of a visible SN (4,5,6), settling a long lasting dispute of a possible wrong redshift estimation given by a chance superposition of GRB 060614 with its purported host galaxy (7). GRB 060614 is therefore a canonical IGC GRB-SN system. We note that this new value of the redshift still marginally fulfills the Amati relation (see Fig. 2 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB060614_Fig2.pdf), and that it is in agreement with z=1.45+/-0.85 given by the Atteia relation (A. Pelangeon & J-L. Atteia, GCN 5265) and with the observational limit of z<1.3 (99.99% CL) given by the combined ultraviolet/optical and X-ray spectra (8).

More optical observations in the GRB field are encouraged for the investigation of the actual host galaxy.
