K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus and Ulysses GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 69205 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  15 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.8E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  4.5E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)=2.928, -35.916 degrees, whose radius is 47.271 +/-  0.194
degrees (3 sigma).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -10 and -40 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl= 32, +2 and 55, -21
degrees, and between RA, Decl= 306, -29 and 298, -61 degrees.

This localization can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
