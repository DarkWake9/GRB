The bright burst, GRB 051111(Krimm et al., GCN4260), triggered 
the Suzaku Wideband All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers 
an energy band of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 05:59:39 (UT). 
The observed prompt emission exhibits a FRED-like lightcurve
with a duration (T90) of 31 seconds. 
The fluence in 100 - 700 keV was (8.4 +/- 0.8)X10^-6 erg/cm2. 
The 1-s peak flux was 1.0 +/- 0.1 photons/cm2/s 
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum 
is well fitted by a single power law with a photon index 
of 1.5 +/- 0.3.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
The WAM onboard calibration is still under way,  and 
systematic errors, such as the flux calibration uncertainties of
about 20%, are not included in the errors.

The WAM light curve of this event is available at

Further detailed analyses are in progress.
