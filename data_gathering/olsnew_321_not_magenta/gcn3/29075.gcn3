On December 16, 2020, the MAGIC telescopes observed GRB 201216C following the
trigger by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM (Beardmore et al., GCN 29061, Fermi/GBM team GCN 29063).
MAGIC started observations under good conditions about 57 seconds after the GRB onset.
The preliminary offline analyses show an excess above 5 sigma, compatible with the GRB position reported
by the Swift and Fermi teams. Refined off-line analyses of the data are ongoing.

We strongly encourage follow-up observations by other instruments at all wavelengths.

The MAGIC point of contact for this burst is O. Blanch (blanch@ifae.es). 
Burst Advocate for this burst is F. Longo (francesco.longo@ts.infn.it).

MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
located at the Observatory Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island
La Palma, Spain, and designed to perform gamma-ray astronomy in the energy
range from 50 GeV to greater than 50 TeV.
