(IKI),V.Rumyantsev  (CrAO),  G.Beskin (SAO) report:

We have observed the WXM error box of XRF030824 (HETE trigger 2821) with
1.5m telescope of Maidanak High-altitude Observatory (UBAI) on August 24.
The 5x300s images taken between 21:19 and 21:51 UT (4.53hrs after the burst)
cover 40% around the center of WXM error circle.  The OT candidate (Moran et
al. GCN 2363) is out of our coverage. Visual comparison with DSS2 reveals no
new sources to the limiting magnitude R~19.5.
