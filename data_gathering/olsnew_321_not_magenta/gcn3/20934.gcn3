report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:


At 2017-03-20T03:42:39.00 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground 
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 170320A, 
which was also detected by INTEGRAL/SPIACS (ID 170320.15474)
and the KONUS-Wind.


The POLAR light curve consists of a single peak,
with a duration (T90) of 5.74 s measured from T0+2.79 s.
The 1-s peak rate measured from T0+3.00 s is 2258.1 cnts/s.
The total counts is about 5844 cnts.

The above results are not dead time corrected. The above
measurements are in the energy range of about 80-500 keV.


All analysis results presented above are preliminary.


POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter (50-500 keV)
on-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 launched on
