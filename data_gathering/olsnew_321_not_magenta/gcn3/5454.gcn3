M. Andreev (Institute of Astronomy), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger
GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed an error box of  the  GRB060805B (Hurley et al. GCN 5407) with
the Z-600 telescope of peak Terskol Observatory on Aug. 7 between (UT)
22:37 - 22:52 in R-band.  Within the Swift/XRT  error box (Butler GCN 5414,
Godet et al. GCN 5428) in a combined image (15x60 s) we clearly detect only
the source (USNO-B1.0 1481-0304497) mentioned earlier (Butler GCN 5414,
Godet et al. GCN 5428).
The limiting magnitude of the combined image is R~19.0.

The message may be cited.
