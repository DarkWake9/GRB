SUBJECT: GRB 081001: Observations from OSN

J. Gorosabel and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, Granada) on
behalf of a larger collaboration report,

We have observed the field of the SuperAGILE GRB 081001
(Lazzarotto et al., GCN 8305) and in particular the Swift/XRT
error box (Page et al., GCN 8307) from the 1.5m OSN telescope
at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Granada (Spain). The
observation consisted of 3x300s I-band exposures with a mean
time of Oct 2.8348 UT (22.7 hours after the burst). We detect just
one source on the edge of the XRT error box, located at the
following coordinates (J2000 +/- 0.7"):
R.A.: 18:26:21.65
Dec.: -08:43:07.6
With a magnitude of I = 19.90+/-0.26 as compared to several
USNO-B1 stars. A finding chart (with the object is marked as A)
can be found in:

No variability can be established at this point. Rechecking of the
unfiltered image reported by Jelínek et al. (GCN 8306) does not
show any significant emission at the location of the object. Further
observations would be needed in order to determine any relation
of this source with the GRB.
