C. Guidorzi (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB), V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA)
A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), P. Romano (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB),
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the GRB 071010 (trigger=293707, Moretti et al., GCN
Circ. 6859) beginning 34 ks after the BAT trigger.  In 2.4 ks of Photon
Counting mode data spanning 34-40 ks after the trigger we found
the X-ray afterglow at RA,Dec =288.06008, -32.40172, which is

RA(J2000) =  19 12 14.42
Dec(J2000)= -32 24 06.2

with error circles of radius 5.3 arcsec (90%, including
boresight uncertainties).

This lies 2.8 arcsec from the position given by the Keck observation
(Bloom et al., GCN Circ. 6861) of the optical afterglow
discovered by TAROT (Klotz et al., GCN Circ. 6860) and
84.8 arcsec from the BAT refined position (Krimm et al., GCN Circ. 6868).

At present, due to the paucity of the observed events, we are unable
to determine the fading rate.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
