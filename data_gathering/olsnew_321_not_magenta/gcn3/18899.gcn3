Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160119A (trigger #671014)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 18893).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 211.916, 20.453 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  14h 07m 39.8s
    Dec(J2000) = +20d 27' 09.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows some low-level activity from about T+20 sec
to T+100 sec.  This is followed by a single main peak starting at T+110 sec,
with a broad peak from T+140 to T+155 sec, and a slow decay out to T+200 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 116 +- 14 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+32.62 to T+190.39 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.68 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+146.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
