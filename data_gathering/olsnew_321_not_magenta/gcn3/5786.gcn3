V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up
collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB061019 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 5728) with Shajn
2.6m telescope of CrAO on Oct. 20 in R-band  and Oct. 21 in integral light.

After refined  analysis of  Oct. 20 observation (Rumyantsev et al., GCN
5740) two objects were identified within/near XRT error circle (Guidorzi et
al., GCN 5733): the object 'a' mentioned in GCN5740, and  the object 'b'.
(Finding chart is available in
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB061019/GRB061019R_ZTSh.gif).
While the object 'a' is present in both epochs, the object 'b' marginally
detected in the first epoch is absent on the combined image of second epoch
(the Oct.21 observation).

Astrometry of source 'b' is following:
RA(J2000)=06 06 30.93 Dec(J2000)=+29 34 12.5 with uncertainties in both
coordinate 0.5". The position of source 'b' coincides within 2-sigma error
bars with the optical afterglow (Covino et al., GCN 5730). We suggest that
the source 'b' is connected with the afterglow. The formal photometry of the
source 'b' based on USNO A2.0 (R) stars:

Date (UT),           Filter, R_mag,            R_Lim (3sigma)
Oct.20 00:07 - 01:47 R       24.86 +0.76/-0.44 24.4
Oct.21 00:48 - 01:28 None    -                 24.5
