FROM:    Alessandro Maselli at INAF/IASF Palermo  <maselli@ifc.inaf.it>

A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT performed a second observation of the INTEGRAL-detected burst 
GRB 131122A (Gotz et al., GCN Circ. 15510) starting on 2013 November 29, 
from 596 to 690 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger, for a total exposure of 
4.9 ks. The source reported in occasion of the first XRT observation by 
Maselli & D'Elia (GCN Circ. 15513) is now detected at a count rate of 
(1.59+/-0.69)e-3 ct/s. This value is considerably lower than 
(1.06+/-0.21)e-2 ct/s corresponding to the first observation: therefore, 
we point at this source as the afterglow of GRB 131122A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
