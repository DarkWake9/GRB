A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this
burst at 06354 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 40 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary, 3 sigma error
boxes each with approximate area 9900 square arcminutes whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)

                                       OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  19 h  3 m 35.56 s      3 o 49 '  34.71 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 18 h 58 m 19.50 s      2 o 18 '  39.61 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 19 h 19 m  5.34 s      8 o 10 '  35.96 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 18 h 49 m 53.89 s      0 o 37 '  58.46 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 19 h  9 m  4.49 s      5 o 19 '  30.42 " 

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further processing.
These error boxes may be improved.
