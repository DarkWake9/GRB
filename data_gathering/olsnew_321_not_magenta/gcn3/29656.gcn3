Bhalerao(IITB), G. C. Anupama(IIA), S. Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the
GIT team:

We observed GRB 210226A detected by Swift-BAT (A. P. Beardmore et al., GCN
29568) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We obtained 10 exposures of
300 sec each in the r' filter. We did not detect any new source in our
stacked image within the 1.5 arcsec circle around R.A.= 08h 16m 27.67s,
DEC.=+57d 35' 02.2". The obtained upper limit follows as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (mid) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Exposure (sec) | Filter | Lim_mag (5-sigma) |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

2459272.1074 | 9.84 | 3000 (stacked) | r' | > 20.34 |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS (Flewelling et al., 2018)
and not corrected for galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
