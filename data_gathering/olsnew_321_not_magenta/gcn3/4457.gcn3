A.J. Levan, N.R. Tanvir (U. Hertfordshire), L. Fuhrman (JACH) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060108 with UKIRT/WFCAM.  A 30 min K-band
exposure was made in ~0.9 arcsec seeing, starting Jan 08 15.23 UT
(ie. approximately 45 minutes post-burst).  Our provisional analysis shows
no evidence for any source within the the XRT afterglow error circle
reported by Page et al. (GCN 4453).

This suggests that the optical/IR afterglow of GRB 060108 was
intrinsically sub-luminous, since otherwise either very high redshift,
or substantial dust extinction would be required to produce our
non-detection.
