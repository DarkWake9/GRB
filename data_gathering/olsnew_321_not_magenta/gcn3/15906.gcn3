Using the data set from T-239 to T+886 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140301A (trigger #589590)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 15896).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 69.521, -34.249 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 38m 05.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -34d 14' 56.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 66%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a roughly symmetric peak starting
at ~T-15 sec, peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 31.0 +- 5.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.18 to T+22.82 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.96 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.4 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
