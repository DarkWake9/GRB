The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:52:14 UT on 1 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201201A (trigger 628483939.910616 / 201201120).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 307.5, Dec = 20.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 30m, 20d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 122.0 degrees.
