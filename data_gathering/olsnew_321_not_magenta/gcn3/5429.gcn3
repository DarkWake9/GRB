D. Martínez and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on behalf
of a larger collaboration, 

report:

"Following the detection by the IPN of the bright GRB 060805B
(Hurley et al. GCNC 5407), we have obtained I-band frames with 
the 1.5m OSN telescope in Spain starting on Aug 8.04 UT (i.e. 
58.3 hr post-burst). Six exposures (300s each) in the I-band 
filter were taken under non optimum technical conditions.  
Within the Swift/XRT X-ray afterglow error box (Butler GCNC 5414, 
Godet et al. GCNC 5428), we only detect a single optical source 
which is also present in the DSS2 with about the same brightness. 
The limiting magnitude of our combined I-band image is I = 20.5".
