K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 62489 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately    2.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.7E-06 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  7.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose approximate area is 186. sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  17 h 49 m 45.54 s     18 o 13 '  35.46 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 17 h 49 m 12.11 s     18 o  8 '  46.17 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 17 h 50 m 55.41 s     18 o 11 '  55.30 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 17 h 48 m 35.74 s     18 o 15 '  14.77 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 17 h 50 m 18.99 s     18 o 18 '  24.53 " 

This error box may be improved.
