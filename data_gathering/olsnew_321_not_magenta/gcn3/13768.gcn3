S. Covino, D. Fugazza, A. Melandri,  on behalf of the REM team report:

We imaged the field of GRB120913B (Helder et al., GCN 13763) with the NIR camera only with the H filter. The REM telescope is at present under substantial maintenance and the optical camera and some of the subsystems are still off-line.

Observations started at UT 23:56:47, about 49 sec after the GRB, and frames were unfortunately not properly focussed. Yet the afterglow (LaClyyze et al., GCN 13764; Klotz et al., GCN 13765) is detectable and approximately 2 min after the GRB was at H = 13.72 +- 0.15, calibrated by means of isolated unsaturated 2MAS stars in the field.
