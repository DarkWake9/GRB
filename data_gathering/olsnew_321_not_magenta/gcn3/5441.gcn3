report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We re-observed the field of GRB 051109B (GCN 4222) centered on the 
revised XRT position (GCN 5387) using the VLA on August 9.5 UT 2006 (t~9 
months after the burst) at a frequency of 1.43 GHz.  Comparison with our 
previous VLA observations (GCN 4245) reveals no new sources within the 
revised XRT error circle.  We place a 3-sigma limit of 0.21 mJy. 
Adopting a redshift of z=0.08 for the putative host galaxy (GCN 5387), 
this limit corresponds to a radio luminosity 100 times fainter than that 
observed for GRB 030329 at a comparable epoch (Frail et al. 2003, ApJ, 
619, 944).
