We imaged the optical afterglow of GRB 030328 (Peterson & Price,
GCN 1974) with the Magellan 6.5-m Clay telescope and LDSS2
imaging/spectrograph on March 30.04 (1.57 days after the
burst). The 2x180 sec R-band images provide a magnitude
estimate of 21.93 +\- 0.06 assuming star "B" (GCN 1977)
is R=16.10. Using the Magellan photometry from March 29
(Martini et al. GCN 1979), we find a powerlaw decay index of
-1.3 +/- 0.1. 

Our R-band magnitude estimate 1.57 days after the burst is close
to that predicted by Price & Peterson (GCN 1977) based
on early photometry and a decay index of -1.0.
