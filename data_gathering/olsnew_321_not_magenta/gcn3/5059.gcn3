A. Moretti (INAF-OAB) on behalf of the Swift XRT team:


A re-analysis of the XRT TDRSS data has led to a different position
from the one issued with GCN 5055. The new estimated position for
the candidate X-ray afterglow is:

RA  (2000) =  18 35 45.6
Dec (2000) = +52 37 54.2

with an uncertainty of 7 arcsec (90% confinement).

We are still waiting for down-linked data for refined
coordinates of the source.
We apologize for the inconvenient.
