The Faulkes Telescope North (Hawaii) observed the field of the INTEGRAL
GRB 040223 (Gotz et al., GCN 2525) during commissioning testing starting
on 23 February at 15:02:19 UT (1.5 hours after the burst). 17 exposures
ranging from 100 to 300 seconds were taken before twilight became too  
bright to continue.

No optical counterpart was identified with an SDSS r'-band magnitude r' <
18.

Further optical observations are not planned.
