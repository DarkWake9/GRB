TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3670
SUBJECT: GRB 050724: Swift/UVOT Upper Limit
DATE:    05/07/24 21:10:45 GMT
FROM:    Margaret Chester at PSU  <chester@astro.psu.edu>

M. Chester (PSU), S. Covino (OAB), P. Schady (MSSL), P. Roming (PSU) N. 
Gehrels (GSFC), on behalf of the Swift UVOT team.

Using summed images from Swift/UVOT of the field of GRB 050724 (Covino 
et al., GCN 3665), accumulated during the first forty minutes after the 
BAT trigger, no new source is detected within the XRT error circle in 
the V filter down to a 3-sigma limit of  V=18.84.

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in orbit, 
and will require refinement with further calibration.
