SUBJECT: GRB 130623A: Swift-XRT and UVOT observations

Dirk Grupe (PSU), Phil Evans (Leicester), Jackie S. Linevsky (PSU/CBHS), 
and Mike Siegel (PSU)  report on behalf of the Swift team:

We have analyzed 5.0 ks of XRT data for the Swift/BAT-detected burst:
GRB 130623A (Cummings, GCN circ. 14921),  from 100.4 ks to 119.3 ks
after the  Swift/BAT trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting
(PC) mode.  An X-ray source is detected within the Swift/BAT error
circle. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 20.85346, -77.77338 which
is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 01 23 24.83
Dec(J2000): -77 46 24.2

with an uncertainty of 4.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 106 arcsec from the Swift/BAT position. 
This source has a count rate in the XRT of (2.7+3.1-1.9)e-3 counts/s
which is equivalent of an X-ray flux of 1.4e-13 erg/s/cm2 assuming a 
standard X-ray afterglow spectrum.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020284.

Swift UVOT observed the field of GRB 130623A for 4611s. There is no 
source at the X-ray position in the white image. The 3sigma upper limit
is 22.6 mag in the Vega system. This magnitude is not corrected for 
the Galactic extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05 in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
