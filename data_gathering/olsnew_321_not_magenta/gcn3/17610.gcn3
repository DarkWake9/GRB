P. A. Evans (U Leicester), N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), C. J. Mountford (U Leicester) and
P. Romano (INAF-IASFPA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Between 08:10:02 UT and 09:03:38 UT Swift reported 5 triggers, all of
which were 64-s image triggers. Trigger 635788 which was identified
as possibly  being on the known source GRS 1915+105 and the rest
(635789, 635790, 635792, 635794) on unknown sources. All of these
triggers occurred while the star trackers had  lost lock. Prompt
images show that Swift was not stationary while  taking these
observations. We believe therefore that these are  spurious  triggers
and are not astrophysical, however until we get the  full ground
dataset we are unable to say this for certain.
