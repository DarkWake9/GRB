TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 060930: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    06/09/30 12:48:59 GMT
FROM:    Heather Swan at U.of Michigan/ROTSE  <hflewell@umich.edu>

H. Swan (U. Michigan), W. Rujopakarn (U. Arizona), S.A. Yost (U.  
Michigan), E.S. Rykoff (U. Michigan), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana  
State), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded
to GRB 060930 (Integral trigger 3503), producing images beginning 6.3
s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first
image at 09:05:08.3 UT, 44.1 s after the burst, under fair conditions.
We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 80 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered
images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma error circle, for both single images and coadding into sets of
10. Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 15.8-17.1;
we set the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
