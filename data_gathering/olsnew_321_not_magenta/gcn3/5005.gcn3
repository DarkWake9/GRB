report:
 
A short, hard GRB was observed at 2006-04-25 16:57:40 by Swift-BAT,
Konus-Wind, Suzaku-WAM, RHESSI, and INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS.  The T90 was 
0.13 +- 0.01 sec.  This burst was Mars-occulted to Odyssey.  The burst 
had 2 main peaks of roughly similar intensity and hardness, the second 
slightly shorter than the first.

The IPN triangulated error box is as follows:

 Center:

 Corners:

   213.8848  -3.1685
 -----------------------
 
The area of the box is 2.53 sq. deg
 
Preliminary analysis of the Konus-Wind data yields a burst fluence of 
2.57 (-1.85, +0.47) x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The peak flux measured from 
T0(K-W)-0.036 s on a 16-ms time scale was 
3.64 (-2.74, +1.06) x 10^-5 erg/cm2/sec. Both are quoted in the 
20 keV - 10 MeV energy range.  The K-W spectrum accumulated from 
T0(K-W) to T0(K-W)+0.128 s is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range) 
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
     dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 0.92 (-0.37, + 0.28) and Ep = 1403 (-594, 1273) keV 
(chi^2 = 16.7/18 dof). T0(K-W) = 61063.000 s UT (16:57:43.000).
 
We note that the X-ray source 1RXS J140902.5-050430, and nearby galaxies 
LEDA 1048719 and LEDA 1047950 are within this error box close to the 
center.
