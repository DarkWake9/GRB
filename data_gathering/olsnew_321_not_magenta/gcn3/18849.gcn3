TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  18849
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G211117: Swift observations of PS15dpn
DATE:    16/01/09 17:52:48 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans and K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

On 2016 Jan 7 at 15:54 Swift began observations of the transient PS15dpn
(Chambers et al., GCN 18811; Cenko et al., GCN 18848), collecting 4 ks
of data.

No X-ray emission was detected at the location of the source, with a
3-sigma upper limit of 2.4e-3 ct/sec, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV flux
of 1.0e-13 erg/cm^2/s (assuming a power-law spectrum with photon index
1.7 and column density 3e20 cm^-2).

UVOT did detect PS15dpn in the uvm2 filter, at a mangitude of 19.09 ± 0.07.

A single uncatalogued X-ray source was found in our observations,
however this is below the RASS upper limit at its location, and likely
unrelated to the LIGO trigger. It has been assigned a rank of 3 under
our classification scheme described at http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

   Source 56:
   =============
     RA:      38.0971 ( = 02h 32m 23.30s) J2000
     Dec:     +18.5781 ( = +18d 34' 41.2") J2000
     Error:     +5.9 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
     Peak Rate:     2.9e-03 ± 1.1e-03 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
     Peak Flux:     1.3e-13 ± 4.9e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
     RASS UL:     1.2e-01 ct/sec, 3-sigma, converted to XRT (0.3-10 keV)
        so the source is not above the RASS 3-sigma upper limit.
     There is no evidence for fading.
     NOTE: this source is not within 200 kpc of a GWGC galaxy.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
