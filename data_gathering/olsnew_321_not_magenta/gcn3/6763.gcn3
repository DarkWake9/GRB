SUBJECT: GRB 070805: UVOT afterglow candidate retraction

P. Schady and A.M. Parsons report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team

The Swift/UVOT re-observed the field of GRB070805 on 2007-08-07 at 
14:36 UT, 1.8 days after the BAT trigger (GCN Circ. 6708). The 
uncatalogued source detected by UVOT in previous white band 
observations (GCN Circ. 6716) is detected and does not show any sign of 
decay. It is therefore unlikely that this source is the afterglow of 
GRB070805.
