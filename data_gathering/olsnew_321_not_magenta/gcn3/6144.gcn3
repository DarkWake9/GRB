A. C. Updike, H. A. Eid, D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University), T. H.
Robertson, T. M. Jordan (Ball State University), and D. A. Kann (TLS)
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

The .9m SARA telescope began imaging the field of GRB 070224 approximately
9 hours after the Swift Trigger 261880 at 20:29:12 UT.  Our observations
were comprised of 180-second exposures in the R band.  After stacking 2
hours worth of exposures, we do not detect any new sources down to a
limiting magnitude of R ~ 21.4 +/- 0.4 mag (based on calibration to 10
field sources from USNO B1.0 R2 band).
