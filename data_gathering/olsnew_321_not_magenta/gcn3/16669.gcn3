Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:54:00.62 UT on 08 August 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst 
Monitor triggered and located GRB 140808A (trigger 429152043/140808038)
for which a possible counterpart was detected by iPTF14eag 
(Singer et al. 2014, GCN 16668). The GBM on-ground location, 
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with the 
iPTF14eag location.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 63 degrees.

The GBM light curve one main episode which consists of several 
overlapping peaks, with a total duration of about 4.7 s (50-300keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+5.0 s is well fit by 
a Band function parameterized as alpha=-0.4+/-0.1, beta=-2.9+/-0.3, 
Ep=115.2+/-7.7 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.2 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 9.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
