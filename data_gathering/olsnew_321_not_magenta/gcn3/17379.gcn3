WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150203A (Ukwatta et al.,
GCN 17377) starting at 04:10:55 UT, 108 s after the burst, with
thin cloud condition. Observations were performed with an automatic
sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the
exposure time was 20 s per image. We do not detect any new source
neither in our single images, nor in the co-add of the first 5 images,
within the enhanced XRT error (Evans, GCN 17378). The typical
limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about 17.8 calibrated
to USNO B1.0.
