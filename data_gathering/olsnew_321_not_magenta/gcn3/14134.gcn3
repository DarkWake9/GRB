S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB130102A (Page et al., GCN 14127) with the
robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope (P60).  Observations began at 01:56 on
2013 January 3 (~ 7.8 hours after the Swift trigger), and were obtained
under poor seeing conditions in the r', i', and z' filters.

We do not detect any sources within the enhanced XRT error localization
(Osborne et al., GCN 14129).  Using nearby point sources from the AAVSO
Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS) for calibration, we measure limiting
magnitudes of r' > 20.9, i' > 20.5 at this time.  We note that these
limits do not include a correction for the large Galactic extinction along
this line of sight.
