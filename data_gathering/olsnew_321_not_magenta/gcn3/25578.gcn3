report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

AGILE observed the long GRB 190829A at T0 = 2019-08-29 19:55:53 (UT) first
reported by Fermi GBM (GCN 25551) and by Swift (GCN 25552).

A sub-threshold gamma-ray source (at about 2.5 sigma) was found by
integrating the AGILE-GRID data from T0 to T0 + 100 s.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limits (ULs) are
obtained above 50 MeV:

- 5.5e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 over the time interval (T0; T0 + 100 s);
- 1.9e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 over the time interval (T0; T0 + 5 hr).

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
