K. Hurley (UC Berkeley), on behalf of the Ulysses/GRB team, T. Cline
(NASA-GSFC), E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii (Ioffe Physico-Technical
Institute), on behalf of the KONUS-Wind team, and D. A.  Smith (MIT)
report:

"Ulysses and KONUS detected GRB981220.  A preliminary triangulation
annulus for this event is centered at RA(2000)=347.373 degrees,
Decl(2000)=+7.336 degrees, with a radius 67.134 +/- 0.020 degrees
(3 sigma).  This annulus intersects the RXTE/ASM error box at

RA(2000)	Decl(2000)

3h 42m 28.5s	17o 06.3'
3h 42m 29.0s    17o 11.1'
3h 42m 39.0s    17o 11.6'
3h 42m 38.5s    17o 06.8'

to form a ~2.4' x 4.5' error box with approximately 11 sq. arcmin. area.
The IPN annulus width can be reduced by a factor of 2 to 4.  An
image may be found at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/newdata.html,
