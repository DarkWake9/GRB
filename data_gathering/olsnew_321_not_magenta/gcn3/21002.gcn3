The long-duration GRB 170403B (Fermi GBM trigger #512931458;
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7799; Konus-Wind trigger time on
16:57:35.034) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 16:57:31.18 on 3 April 2017.  The burst signal was only seen by
the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak starting at T0+2 sec,
peaking at T+5 sec and ending at T+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 6.7 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
