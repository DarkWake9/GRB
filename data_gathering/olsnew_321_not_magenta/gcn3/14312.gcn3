(UPV/EHU-IAA/CSIC), W. Allen (Vintage Lane Obs.), Ph. Yock (Auckland
Univ.), P. Kubanek (IP AS CR & IAA-CSIC), and A. J. Castro-Tirado
(IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

  "We observed the field of GRB 130315A (Evans et al., GCNC 14311),
detected by Swift/BAT, with the 0.6m Yock-Allen robotic telescope
(BOOTES-3) located in Blenheim, New Zealand. Unfiltered images were
obtained starting 13:21:02UT (35m after the burst, limited by clouds). An
exposure of 30 seconds revealed no uncatalogued sources down to a magnitude
of RMag~16.5 when compared to the USNO-B1 catalogue."
