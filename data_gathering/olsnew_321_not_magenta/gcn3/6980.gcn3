"We observed the field of GRB 071021 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6958) with  
PAIRITEL (*) starting at 2007-10-22 04:53 UT in high wind and poor  
seeing conditions at Mt Hopkins, Arizona. In the first 1340 second  
stack, the IR source noted by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 6968/6971) is  
not detected to J=18.35 mag, H=16.87 mag, Ks=16.43 (2.5 sigma upper  
limit). This is not particularly constraining in light of the deep  
Subaru imaging (Terada et al. GCN 6976) at a similar epoch.

  We note that despite the z-band detection (Malesani et al. GCN  
#6972) the very high-redshift hypothesis of Sakamoto et al. (GCN  
6967) is not yet ruled out. In particular, in high z QSO spectra  
there can be some transmitted flux (in the z-band filter  
transmission) through the Lyman-alpha forest between ~8000 Ang and  
8500 Ang (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2006 **) for z > 6.3 sources. So long  
as the redshifted Lyman limit at the redshift of the emitting source  
is blueward of ~8500 Ang, this light would not be entirely  
suppressed. This consideration yields an upper limit:

                         (1 + z_GRB)*912 Ang < 8500 Ang
                                     z_GRB <~ 8.3

  At such redshifts, say z_GRB = 8, all reported long-wavelength  
observations to-date would be naturally accommodated:

  - the deep non-detections at R and i-band (Berger & Covarrubias,  
GCNs 6973,6974), being blueward of 912*[1+z_GRB])
   - the faint detection at z-band (GCN 6972) due transmitted flux  
between 912*[1+z_GRB] = 8200 and 8500 Ang is allowed (as above)
   - the afterglow detections at H and K (GCN 6968; Terada et al. GCN  
6976)
   - the apparent faintness of J-band flux (GCN 6968) relative to H  
and K given the Gunn-Peterson trough would extend to (1 + z_GRB)*1216  
Ang =~ 1.1 micron.

  All of this assumes that the z-band source is not a foreground  
galaxy (in which case a higher-z GRB suggested by Castro-Tirado et  
al. is allowed).  If indeed the GRB originated from z > 7, we would  
expect to see what would resemble emission lines between lam_obs =  
912*[1+z_GRB] and ~8500 Ang, motivating the utility of *optical*  
spectroscopy of this source. Even without spectroscopy, when final  
magnitudes are reported along with filter transmission curves, a full  
SED should be illuminating."
