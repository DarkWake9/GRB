We observed GRB 201017A reported by Fermi GBM Team (GCN #28665) and Swift-BAT
(A. D'Ai et al., GCN #28666; also see:- V. Lipunov et al., GCN #28667; M.R.
Goad et al., GCN #28671; L. P. Xin et al., GCN #28672; S. Poolakkil et al.,
GCN #28675; J.A. Kennea et al., GCN #28678; S. Belkin et al., GCN #28679) with
0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. The field was observed in the SDSS r’ filter
starting at 2020-10-17T12:54:58.41 UT i.e. ~3.13 hrs after the event
detection by Swift-BAT. We did not find any new source in the stacked image
of 10*300 sec exposure, within an uncertainty region of 2.6 arcsec around RA
(J2000): 02h 26m 28.82s, Dec (J2000): +66d 40' 43.6" (GCN 28671) up to r’ >
21.01 mag (5-sigma), calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data release,
(Flewelling et al., 2018). Assuming a typical power-law decay, this upper
limit is consistent with the r’=22.9 mag detection by Belkin et al (GCN #
28679).

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
