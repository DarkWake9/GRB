report:

The short-duration GRB 190630A was detected
by Fermi (GBM trigger 583567803), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and Insight (HXMT/HE) at about 22198 s UT (06:09:58).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=32.604 deg (02h 10m 25s)  Dec(2000)=-47.005 deg (-47d 00' 16"),
whose radius is 73.654 +/- 2.609 deg (3 sigma).

The annulus is partially consistent with the 90% localization
probability region of GW compact binary merger candidate
event S190630ag (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration GCN Circ. 24922).

This annulus may be improved.
