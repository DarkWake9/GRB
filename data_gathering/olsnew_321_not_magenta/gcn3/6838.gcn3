W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB
team, report:

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick
Observatory observed GRB 071003 detected with Swift (Trigger 292934;
Schady et al. GCN 6837). The automatic sequence started at 07:41:37,
42 s after the burst. The BAT location has been monitored in V, I,
and clear filters, with varying exposure times. Our image processing
pipeline found a new object within the BAT error circle, with the
following position:

R. A. = 20:07:24.12
DEC.  = +10:56:51.8  (J2000)

The OA has magnitude of 12.8 (calibrated with USNO B1.0) in a 5s
unfiltered exposure started at 07:41:37 UT, 42s after the BAT trigger.
The new object is close to a bright foreground star. Further Analysis
is ongoing. A finder chart can be found at
