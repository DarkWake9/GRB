We carried out follow-up observations of GRB210919A (A. Tohuvanohu et al.
GCNC #30846) with the 1-m telescope at Mt. Lemon Optical Astronomy
Observatory (LOAO) in US Arizona. Observations began on September 19 at
10:42:02 UT , ~10.23 hours after the GRB trigger. We took 19 X 180s
exposures in Johnson R-band.

We also observed the same field with the 0.43-meter (17 inch) Lee Sang Gak
Telescope (LSGT) located at the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in
Australia. Imaging began on the same day at 16:12:53 UT, ~15.73 hours after
the GRB trigger. The observations were performed in a Sloan r-, i- and
z-band sequences with 11 X  300s exposures in each band.


No GRB optical counterpart was found in the LOAO and LSGT data within the
XRT error area (M. R. Goad et al. GCNC #30850). This result is consistent
with the optical observational results by other teams (V. Lipunov et al.
GCNC #30847, Y.-D. Hu et al. GCNC #30848, R. Strausbaugh et al. GCNC
#30849, M.R. Goad et al. GCNC #30850, N. Pankov et al. GCNC #30851, D. A.
Perley et al. GCNC #30852, M. Perri et al. GCNC #30854 and Y.Takamatsu et
al. GCNC #30855).


The following is our observation results.

We calibrated flux with the PS1 catalog and used AB magnitude system. (The
magnitudes are not corrected for extinction.)
