MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) located in 
Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB130102A (Page et. al. GCN14127)   104 
sec after GRB time at 2013-01-02 18:12:37 UT in 
two  polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found 
optical transient  within SWIFT  error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.9 mag

MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located near Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB130102A (Page et. al. 
GCN 14127)   107
sec after GRB time at 2013-01-02 18:12:40 UT in
two  diagonal polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t 
found optical transient  within SWIFT  error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 13.9 mag. The low limit is the 
resultsa of the high zenit distance.

We note that there are no objects in any catalogs 10" around center of 
the Swift XRT error box (Osborne et. al. GCN 14129).
