The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction 
of IceCube-190124A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/23785.gcn3) in a time range of 2 days centered on the alert 
event time (2019-01-23 03:43:54.79 UTC to 2019-01-25 03:43:54.79 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding 
the event that prompted the alert, 1 additional track-like event is found in spatial coincidence with the 
90% PSF containment of IceCube-190124A. We find that this additional event is well described by atmospheric 
background expectations, with a p-value of 0.07. Accordingly, these data would represent a time-integrated 
muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 6.32 x 10^-4 TeV cm^-2  
for this observation period.

A subsequent search was performed to include the previous month of data (2018-12-24 03:43:54.79 UTC to 2019-01-25 03:43:54.79 UTC). 
In this case, 2 additional track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the 90% PSF containment of IceCube-190124A. For this search, we report a p-value of 0.20, consistent with no significant excess of track events, and a corresponding
time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 8.81 x 10^-4 TeV cm^-2.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
