F. A. Harrison, S. A. Yost, S. R. Kulkarni report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We observed the field containing GRB010222 with Chandra ACIS for
17 ksec, beginning on March 3.44 UT.  We detect an X-ray source
within 1" of the position of the optical transient (GCN 961, 962) 
14:52:12.55 43:01:06.26 (J2000) and consistent with the X-ray
transient detected by the BeppoSAX NFI (GCN 966). Preliminary 
analysis shows a 2-10 keV X-ray flux of 7.2e-14 erg/cm2/s for
this source.
