The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:07:10 UT on 11 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191111B (trigger 595170435.791792 / 191111547).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 239.4, Dec = -70.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 57m, -70d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 34.0 degrees.
