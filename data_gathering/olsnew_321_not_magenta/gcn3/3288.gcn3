At 11:00:34.6 UT Swift-BAT triggered on burst GRB 050418 
(trigger=114893).  The BAT flight position is RA,Dec=44.341,-18.538 
(J2000).  We note this is 34 deg from the Sun, hence the s/c did not 
slew because of the Sun observing constraint.  The burst was 39 deg 
off the BAT boresight.  The lightcurve shows a main peak of duration 
15-20 seconds, followed by apparent peaks at up to 70-80 seconds after 
the trigger.  The peak count rate measured by BAT was 4500 counts/sec 
in the 15-350 keV band.
