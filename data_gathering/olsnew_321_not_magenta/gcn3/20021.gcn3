S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA,Saclay), C.Ferrigno, 
E.Bozzo, M.Tuerler (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:36:32 UT of 2016 October 10.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=  275.2178 deg
DEC.=  -28.7868 deg

with an uncertainty of  1.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux larger than 6 ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range larger than 4e-6 
erg/cmq. Note that due to telemetry saturation we can give only lower 
limits on fluence and peak flux.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
