We observed GRB 190106A using 0.61m reflector of our observatory at
Sitapur, West Bengal, India. The observation was with R, V, and B filters
in a short interval at around 16:45UT on 6th January, 2019, i.e., about
three hours after the BAT trigger (Sonbas et al. 2019; GCN 23615). Using
two exposures each of 90s in R and in V, we obtained the magnitudes of
17.83+/-0.25 and 18.45 +/- 0.23 respectively. Using one 90s exposure in B,
we obtained the magnitude of 18.81+/-0.39. Using triangulation, we obtained
the location of the afterglow to be RA(J2000) = 01h 59m 31.17s, Dec(J2000)
= +23d 50m 43.94s with two pixel error 0.46s. Three sigma method was used
to estimate the magnitudes with a calibrator J01593557 +2348527 which is of
V mag ~12.5. After 24 hours of the BAT trigger we do not detect the
afterglow on 7th Jan. at 13:30UT. The details of images and other results
will be in http:/csp.res.in.
