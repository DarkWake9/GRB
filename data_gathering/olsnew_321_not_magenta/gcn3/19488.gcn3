SUBJECT: GRB160601A: NOT afterglow confirmation

S. Schulze (PUC, MAS), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), A. A. Djupvik (NOT) and P. Jakobsson (U Iceland) report on behalf a larger collaboration:

We re-observed the field of the short GRB 160601A (Kocevski et al., GCN 19478) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC imager. Our first 600-s exposure in the r band started on June 1 at 21:14:48 UT (13.5 hr after the GRB).

We cleanly detect the two objects reported in Malesani et al. (GCN 19485).

Object (1) (RA, Dec. = 15:39:43.97, +64:32:30.5) faded from 22.85 +- 0.10 to 23.36 +- 0.10 mag. The fading corresponds to a decay slope of 0.64 +- 0.25.

Object (2) (RA, Dec. = 15:39:44.91, +64:32:32.1) exhibits no variability beyond the 1.7 sigma confidence level.

These properties let us conclude that object (1) is the afterglow of the short GRB.
