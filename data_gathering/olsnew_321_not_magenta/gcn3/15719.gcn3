D. Xu (DARK/NBI) reports

Inspection of the UVOT u-band image of the field1 of the tiled Swift
observations (Evans, GCN 15715) reveals a very bright optical source,
no present at DSS, at coordinates

R.A. = 01:54:57.50
Dec. = -36:16:38.71

Error Circ. ~ 1.5 arcsec

No known minor planet, near-Earth object, and comet would appear at
this position at the UVOT observational time.

Thus this object could be the optical afterglow of GRB 140110A, and
may worth some photometric follow-ups to check its variation.
