   K.S. Baliyan, S. Ganesh, UC Joshi (MIRO-PRL, Ahmedabad, India) report:

   
   We observed the field around position of the optical counterpart of 
   GRB061126 (Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger number 240766) 
   beginning about 8 hours after the burst. The 1296*1152 CCD mounted 
   on the 1.2 M telescope of Mt Abu IR Observatory, operated by Physical 
   Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad- India, was used to observe OT in RI 
   bands and white light. Several images with exposure times 120 secs 
   and 180 secs are taken.
    
   A visible inspection of the images shows a very faint source in I 
   band and white light at the position reported by D. E. Vanden Berk, 
   B. Sbarufatti, and S. D. Barthelmy (GCN 5856). Results of the
   detailed photometry will be reported later. The monitoring is on.
