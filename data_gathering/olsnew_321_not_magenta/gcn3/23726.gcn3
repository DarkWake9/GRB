K. D. Alexander (Northwestern), T. Laskar (University of Bath), E. Berger
(Harvard), C. G. Mundell (University of Bath), and R. Margutti
(Northwestern), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN 23688) with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2019 January 15.05 UT (4.2 hours
after the burst). At a mean frequency of 33.5 GHz, we detect a radio source
with a preliminary flux density of 3.1 mJy at the position

RA (J2000) = 03:38:01.191 +/- 0.04 arcsec
Dec (J2000) = -26:56:46.73 +/- 0.02 arcsec

consistent with the position of the optical afterglow (Tyurina et al., GCN
23690; Lipunov et al., GCN 23693; Selsing et al., GCN 23695)
and the XRT afterglow (Osborne et al. GCN 23704). Follow-up observations are
planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
