W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, H. Enos, and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

A bright, short-duration, soft burst
was detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Mars-Odyssey (HEND), CALET(GBM), and Swift (BAT)
at about 22323 s UT (06:12:03) on May 10.
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
 ---------------------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
 ---------------------------------------------
 Center:
  293.680 (19h 34m 43s) +21.858 (+21d 51' 27")
 Corners:
  294.067 (19h 36m 16s) +22.043 (+22d 02' 34")
  293.954 (19h 35m 49s) +22.349 (+22d 20' 58")
  293.295 (19h 33m 11s) +21.669 (+21d 40' 09")
  293.409 (19h 33m 38s) +21.360 (+21d 21' 36")
 ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 937 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 1.1 deg (the minimum one is 17 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 104 deg.

This box may be improved.

The position of SGR 1935+2154 is inside the box
at 3.7 arcmin from its center.

Given the positional coincidence of this burst with
SGR 1935+2154, its time history, and softness of its
spectrum (as observed by Konus-Wind), we conclude that
this burst likely originated from SGR 1935+2154.

A triangulation map is posted at

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
