The long-duration, soft-spectrum GRB 130701A
(Swift-BAT trigger 559482: Kuin, et al., GCN 14953)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=15462.161 s UT (04:17:42.161)

The light curve shows a multi-peaked pulse from ~T0-0.5 s to ~T0+5 s.
The emission is seen up to 0.5 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB130701_T15462/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (5.8 ± 0.2)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.896 s,
of (4.3 ± 0.4)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1.2 MeV range
by the cutoff power law with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -1.1 ± 0.1,
the peak energy Ep = 89 ± 4 keV,
chi2 = 55.1/60 dof.

Assuming z=1.155 (Xu, et al., GCN 14956),
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,
Omega_M = 0.27, and Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters of the burst:
the isotropic energy release E_iso ~ 2.1x10^52 erg,
the peak luminosity (L_iso)_max ~ 3.3x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy Ep,i ~ 190 keV

All the quoted results are preliminary.
