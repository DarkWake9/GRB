"During a technical run, we observed the
position of GRB 121123A (E. A. Helder et al., GCN 13982) with the NIKA
instrument being commissioned at the IRAM 30-m at Pico Veleta.
Observations were accomplished between 15h and 16h UT on 24th November
2012 (mean time 29.5 hours after the burst), under poor observing
conditions (tau225GHz ~ 0.35) and at relatively low elevation (35 deg).
In roughly 40 minutes effective time on source, we do not detect the
afterglow at the position given by D. Xu et al., GCN 13986. The
following 3-sigma upper limits were derived:

 U.L. 3 mJy at 150 GHz
(99.7% C.L.)
 U.L. 40 mJy at 240 GHz (99.7% C.L.), strongly limited by
unstable weather conditions

NIKA is a multi-hundred-pixels dual-band
continuum instrument operating simultaneously at central frequencies of
150 GHz (bandwidth 40 GHz) and 240 GHz (bandwidth 60 GHz). It is the
first instrument based on the intrinsically multiplexable KID (Kinetic
Inductance Detectors) technology installed permanently at a telescope.
For more information about the instrument and the future project NIKA-2,
see A. Monfardini et al., ApJS 194, Issue 2, id. 24 (2011). 

We thank
the IRAM Granada and Grenoble staff for their outstanding support
before, during and after the NIKA run."
