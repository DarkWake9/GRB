The long intense GRB 120707A
(GBM trigger 363381140: Younes, GCN 13422;
IPN localization: Hurley at al., GCN 13424)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=69146.810s UT (19:12:26.810)

The light curve shows a strong pulse peaked at ~T0+24 s.
A total duration of the burst is ~95 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120707_T69146/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.35(-0.15,+0.15)x10-4 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+24.064 s,
of 1.05(-0.15,+0.15)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+57.600 s)
is best fit in the 30 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.54 (-0.09, +0.12),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.22 (-0.24, +0.14),
the peak energy Ep = 190(-37, +41) keV,
chi2 = 74.9/82 dof.

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+20.224 to T0+26.368 s)
is best fit in the 30 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.30 (-0.12, +0.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.3 (-0.38, +0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 213(-41, +53) keV,
chi2 = 86.4/82 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
