Patrick Wiggins (Stansbury Park, Utah, United States) reports the following 
optical observations of the error box of GRB 130427A (GCN Circ #14448,
Maselli et al.) to the AAVSO International High Energy Network:

P. Wiggins reports three hours of time-series photometry of the bright GRB 
130427A (Maselli et al., GCN Circ. #14448; Elenin et al., GCN Circ. # 
14450). Wiggins used a 0.35-m C-14 f/5.5 telescope with an SBIG ST-10XME 
camera and clear filter located in Stansbury Park, Utah.  Observations 
commenced 2013 April 27 08:05:12 UT -- less than 20 minutes post trigger 
-- and continued through 11:10:06 UT.  The first four observations were 
made with 60-second exposure times, which were found to be close to 
saturation; subsequent exposure times were 30 seconds.  The transient was 
detected by visual inspection of the first frame, and found to be very 
bright.  Time-series observations were begun immediately.

Thirty-three images of the field were taken, and the resulting light curve 
is as follows.  All magnitudes are taken with respect to the comparison 
star GSC 01984-00021, which has an r-magnitude of 12.553 (APASS DR7, 
http://www.aavso.org/apass ); the resulting magnitudes should be 
interpreted as through a clear filter with r'-band zero point.  Note that 
the first four magnitudes with integration times of 60 seconds may be 
saturated.  All times are given as the mid-point of the exposure, UT on 
2013 April 27, and T(0)+h is hours since trigger (07:47:57 UT):
