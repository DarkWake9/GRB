A. Cucchiara and D. B. Fox (Penn State), with E. Berger (Princeton and 
Carnegie
Observatories), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Starting on 2007 November 13.33 UT we observed GRB 071112C (Perri et 
al., GCN
7059) with the GMOS spectrograph on the Gemini North telescope.
We obtained 4x900 sec spectra in the wavelength range 3900-6800A.
We clearly observe several metal absorption features corresponding to MgII,
MgI, FeII, and MnII at a redshift z = 0.823, confirming the preliminary
redshift reported from VLT observations by Jacobsson et al.(GCN 7076)."
