A. Higgins (Univ. Leicester), K. Wiersema (Univ. Warwick)  and D. B. Malesani (DAWN/NBI and DARK/NBI) report:

We observed the field of GRB 180805B, classified as short with extended emission (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 23076; Sakamoto et al., GCN 23082), using the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) equipped with the EFOSC2 camera. Our observations consist of 9 images in i band, for a total of 1800 s exposure, with mid time 2018 August 6.28 UT (17.76 hr after the GRB trigger), and were
obtained as part of the SPLOT programme (Higgins et al. 2018, subm.).

No counterpart is detected inside the UVOT-enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 23077) in our coadded image, down to a 3-sigma upper limit i > 25 (AB), adopting i = 20.56 for the Pan-STARRS star at RA = 01:43:07.462, Dec = -17:28:30.90.

We thank D. Castex for support with these observations.
