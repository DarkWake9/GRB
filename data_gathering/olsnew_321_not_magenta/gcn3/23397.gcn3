Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181030A (trigger #869494)
(Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 23389).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 146.916, 14.657 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  09h 47m 39.8s
  Dec(J2000) = +14d 39' 26.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 71%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a long pulse that starts at ~T0 and peaks
at ~T+70 s. The main pulse emission ends at ~T+200 s, with some weak emission lasting
till ~T+400 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 304.7 +- 76.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+3.2 to T+443.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+71.33 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
