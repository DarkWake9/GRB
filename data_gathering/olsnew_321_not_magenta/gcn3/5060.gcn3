report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Under the automated control of SkyNet, the 0.37-m TTT telescope, located
outside of Fort Collins, Colorado, began observing the localization of GRB
060502A (Parola et al., GCN 5047) 65 seconds after the initial
notification, and 17.8 minutes after the time of the burst in the V & Red
filters.

In our first 160-s exposure at a mean time of 19.1 minutes after the burst,
we do not see the afterglow (Parola et al. GCN 5047, Cenko et al., 5048)
down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of R ~ 17.5.
