We observed the two most promising candidates reported by the Zwicky Transient Facility (Kasliwal et al., GCN 24191) for the follow up the GW candidate S190425z (GCN 24168) with the GROWTH-India telescope. We obtained multiple images in g, r, and i bands, with exposures ranging from 300 sec - 600 sec. Source photometry for ZTF19aarykkb is given below.

2019-04-25 23:06:41	2458599.463	600	g	18.36	0.17

We also observed ZTF19aarzaod multiple times with 3 exposures in g band, 4 r and 2 i band exposures respectively, each with an exposure time of 600 seconds. We see a weak source in the r and i band images, further analysis is underway. The source appears to be fading rapidly in all bands.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA).
