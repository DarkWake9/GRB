Arto Oksanen (Muurame, Finland) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Varkaus, Finland) 
report to the AAVSO High Energy Network the following optical observations 
of GRB 080430 (Guidorzi et al., GCN Circular #7647):

Arto Oksanen (Hankasalmi Obs., Hankasalmi, Finland) reports the detection 
of the optical counterpart of GRB 080430.  Unfiltered observations were 
made using a 0.4-meter RC telescope with an SBIG STL-1001E CCD.  The 
initial Swift XRT position was observed unfiltered with an initial set of 
10 60-second exposures having a mid-point time of 2008 April 30, 20:08:54 
UT; the afterglow was detected with a magnitude of 18.1 +/- 0.05 
calibrated relative to GSC 3450-0639.  Astrometry of the initial frames 
yields a position of RA 11:01:14.76 , Dec +51:41:08.9 (USNOA2.0 ref, +/- 
0.4 arcseconds), which is within the stated uncertainties of the UVOT 
position (GCNCirc #7647).

Images taken between April 30.839 and April 30.969 UT were reanalyzed and 
calibrated relative to two USNO-B1.0 stars of magnitude ~16.5. Photometry 
of combined frames yields a smoothly decaying light curve during the span 
of observations:

Markku Nissinen and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus Hill Observatory, Varkaus, 
Finland) also report the detection of the optical afterglow of GRB 080430. 
Observations were made using a Meade LX-200 0.3-meter telescope with an 
SBIG ST8-XME CCD; observations were made using both clear and R filters. 
A total of six 600-second exposures were obtained having an average 
midpoint time of 2008 April 30.943.  Photometry of the combined clear and 
Rc frames yields magnitudes of CR=19.2+/-0.3 and R=19.5+/-0.5 calibrated 
relative to the GSC2.3 star N7JI005540.  The observers noted the sky was 
not completely dark due to their high latitude and time of year.
