on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 11:30:03 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050124.  The spacecraft did not autonomously slew
to the burst because automatic operations were disabled for weekend
operations.  The spacecraft will be repointed via a Target of
Opportunity command.

The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 192.879, +13.026
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 6 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a
systematic uncertainty).  This is a high significance burst.  The
structure of the burst is double-peaked with a duration of ~4 seconds.
