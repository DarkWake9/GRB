The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:45:16 UT on 28 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210328A (trigger 638657121.97022 / 210328865).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 207.9, Dec = -8.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 51m, -8d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79.0 degrees.
