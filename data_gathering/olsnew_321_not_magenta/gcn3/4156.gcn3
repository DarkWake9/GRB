Soderberg, S. B. Cenko, P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) 
report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie collaboration:

"We observed galaxy "B" (GCN 4143), located within the XRT error circle of the
HETE GRB 051022 (GCN 4131; 4137; 4141) and coincident with the radio afterglow
detected by Cameron et al. (GCN 4154), using the double spectrograph mounted
on the 200" Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. Preliminary reduction of 
a 3600s-long red spectrum of this galaxy reveals a strong line at observed 
wavelength 6736 Angstrom which we identify as OII 3727 at z=0.8. This
identification is supported by weaker detections of OIII 5007 and 4959, as
well as Hbeta and Hgamma. We conclude that the likely host of GRB 051022
is at z=0.8. Further analysis is underway."
