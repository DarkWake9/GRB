R. Margutti, (INAF-OAB), Nakahira (AGU), M. Morii, N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech),
H. Negoro (Nihon U.) and A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT and MAXI team:

The Swift-XRT conducted a second observation of GRB 110213B (Negoro et
al. GCN. Circ. 11716), gathering 4.9 ks of data between T0+250ks and
T0+275 ks. Source B reported by Nakahira (GCN Circ. 11725)
has faded to a level of  0.005 +/- 0.001 count/sec, with a power-law decay
index of alpha= -1.4 +/- 0.3. This source is thus confirmed as the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 110213B.


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
