Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080714 (trigger #316910)
(Perri, et al., GCN Circ. 7978).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 188.104, -60.274 deg which is
   RA(J2000) = 12h 32m 24.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -60d 16' 28.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The
partial coding was 43%. 

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a single peak with a rise time of about
3 seconds and an exponential decay with a time constant of about 10 
seconds. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is 33 +- 9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
There is a small peak in the raw light curve, mostly above 25 keV, at about
T-90 sec that appears to be from a different source, out of the field of 
view.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.6 to T+50.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.52 +- 0.08. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.37 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
