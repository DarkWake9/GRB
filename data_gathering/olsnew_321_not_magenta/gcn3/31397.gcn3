report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by
a bright short burst from SGR J1555.2-5402 at 2022-01-06T13:33:47.500 UTC (T0).

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 15-65 keV, this burst mainly
consists of a single pulse with a duration about 100 ms.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): 
Ra: 261.9 deg 
Dec: -46.7 deg
Err: 13.4 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

The location given by 
GECAM-B alone is consistent with SGR J1555.2-5402 within the error.

In addition, according to our multiple-mission joint analysis system
(ETJASMIN, S. Xiao et al., submitted to MNRAS, S. Xiao et al., 2021, ApJ, 920 43) 
using GECAM-B and Fermi/GBM public data, this burst is localized to an annulus which is 
very consistent with SGR J1555.2-5402. 

The GECAM-GBM joint location could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
