(Nordic Optical Telescope) report:

"Using ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope we have obtained further
imaging of the field of GRB 050802.422 (Band et al. GCN 3734, McGowan et
al. GCN 3739) on 2005, August 3.9 UT. From Aug 2.9 UT to Aug 3.9 UT the
object has faded from about R=20.5 to R=22.5 (based on preliminary
photometry), indicating a fairly steep early decay.
   In the image from Aug 3.9 there is contamination from an
extended source, presumably the host galaxy. This fairly bright host
galaxy makes it feasible to make an independent measurement of the
redshift of the burst and hence confirm or reject the tentative
measurement reported by Fynbo et al. GCN 3749.
