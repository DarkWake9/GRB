and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171212C (Konus-Wind trigger time on 22:53:41.759)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:53:37.68 on
12 December 2017.  The burst signal was seen only by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows two weak pulses.  The emission starts
at T0, peaks at T+0.5 sec and ends at T+30 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 27.2 +- 3.6 sec (40-1000 keV).  The T50 duration measured
by the SGM data is 18.1 +- 4.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
