The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:03:44 UT on 8 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220608A (trigger 676357429.750658 / 220608211).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 229.3, Dec = -0.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 17m, 0d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
