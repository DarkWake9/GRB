S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the location of GRB151215A (Gibson et al., GCN 18691) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations began at 3:07 UT (~ 6 minutes after the BAT trigger) and were obtained in the r', i', and z' filters.  

Just outside the XRT error circle, we find a fading source at (J2000.0) coordinates:

   RA: 06:14:20.22
   Dec: +35:30:57.2

Using calibration from nearby point sources, we find the object fades from i' = 17.47 +/- 0.05 mag at 3:07 UT to 18.58 +/- 0.15 mag at 3:24 UT.  Thus, we believe this quite likely to be the optical afterglow of GRB151215A.

Further observations are planned.
