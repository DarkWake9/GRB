The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:39:44 UT on 9 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211109A (trigger 658111189.167684 / 211109028).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 129.1, Dec = -33.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 36m, -33d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 49.0 degrees.
