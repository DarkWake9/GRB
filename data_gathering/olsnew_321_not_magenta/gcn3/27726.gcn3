Observatory Team:

At 20:33:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200512A (trigger=971846).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 7.396, -2.199 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 29m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 11' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 20:34:25.5 UT, 69.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 7.41520, -2.21052
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 29m 39.65s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 12' 37.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 80 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.94
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 7.60e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
235 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.03.
