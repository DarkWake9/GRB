WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the short-duration GRB 130626A
(De Pasquale et al., GCN 14931) starting at 10:52:40 UT, 97 s after
the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in V, I, and clear filters (20 s exposure for each image). We detect
the DSS source mentioned by Butler et al. (GCN 14943) in the
corrected candidate XRT circle (Page et al., GCN 14937). We do not
detect any new source in the XRT error circle. The estimated limiting
magnitude in our first clear-band (close to R) image is about 18.7
(calibrated to USNO B1.0) at a midtime of 174 s after the burst.
