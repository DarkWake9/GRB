G. Masi (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and European Southern Observatory, 
Chile), B. L. Jensen, J. Hjorth (Copenhagen University) and R. Michelsen 
(Astronomical Observatory, Copenhagen) report: 

We imaged the field around the afterglow candidate reported by Gilmore at 
al. for GRB030323 (GCN 1949) with the Danish 1.54m telescope (La Silla) + 
DFOSC CCD camera. Observations started around March 25.0, 2003 UT. We 
located the source at the following position (J2000.0): 

RA: 11h06m09.40s; Decl.: -21d46'13.2" 

(mean residuals: 0.15"; catalogue: USNO-SA2.0) 

in excellent agreement with the astrometry provided in the GCN cited above. 

We performed time-resolved, R-band photometry, assuming for the reference 
stars the magnitudes provided by Henden et al. (GCN 1948). Results follow: 

25 Mar. 0:01    20.38 Rc
       0:05    20.37
       0:09    20.57
       0:12    20.56
       0:16    20.43
       0:29    20.53
       0:33    20.55
       0:37    20.48
       0:40    20.57
       0:44    20.49
       0:48    20.41
       1:01    20.62
       1:04    20.61
       1:08    20.49
       1:12    20.62
       1:19    20.57
       2:54    20.47
       3:00    20.54
       3:05    20.44
       3:11    20.51
       3:17    20.59 

The candidate showed just a modest fading during the run. 

In addition, we provide V and Ic magnitudes, again based on GCN 1948: 

25 Mar. 2:23  20.10 Ic
25 Mar. 3:35  22.08 V 

If a better calibration for the field will be available, photometry will be 
improved accordingly.
