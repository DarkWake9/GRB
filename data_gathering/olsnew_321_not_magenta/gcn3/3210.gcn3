A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed the
field of GRB050408 (GCN 3189) on 2005 Apr 9.26 UT.
We do not detect a radio source coincident with the
X-ray or optical afterglow positions (GCNs 3191 and 3192).
We place a 2-sigma limit of 74 uJy at the optical position.

Further observations are planned."
