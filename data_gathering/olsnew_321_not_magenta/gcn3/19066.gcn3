Using the data set from T-239 to T+581 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB
160223A (trigger #675361) (Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ.
19057). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 147.603, 9.369 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 50m 24.8s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 22' 09.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 53%.

BAT light curve shows two episodes. The first episode
starts ~T-10 sec, peaks at ~T+0 sec and ends around ~T+20 sec.
The second multi-peaked episode starts around T+70 sec and
ends around ~T+120 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is
127 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.00 to T+143.13 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law
index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.34 +- 0.07.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
5.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T+109.95 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
3.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at
the 90% confidence level.
