A. C. Updike, K. V. Garimella, and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) 
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 061019 (GCN 5728) 4 hours and 52 minutes 
after  Swift Trigger 234516 (Guidorzi et al.) with the SARA 0.9m at Kitt 
Peak under good weather conditions.  We obtained 20 180-second exposures 
in the R band.  We find no fading OT candidate down to a limiting 
magnitude of R = 20.5 +/-  0.3 mag (based on calibration of 10 field 
sources from USNO A2.0).
