TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4007
SUBJECT: Possible GRB 050922 detected by INTEGRAL

D.Gotz, S.Mereghetti (IASF, Milano) S. Shaw, N. Mowlavi, M. Beck, J. 
Zurita Heras (ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of 
the IBAS Localization Team report:

A possible GRB triggered IBAS at 13:43:18 UT with coordinates (J2000)

R.A. = 271.1541
Dec. = -32.0235

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcmin radius (90% c.l.).

The trigger significance was below the threshold for automatic alert delivery.

A preliminary analysis shows a spectrum consistent with an X-ray flash and 
a fluence (20-200 keV) is 1E-7 erg/cm^2. However, due to the position in 
the galactic bulge and the soft spectrum, we cannot exclude that the 
trigger is due to an uncatalogued Galactic source.
