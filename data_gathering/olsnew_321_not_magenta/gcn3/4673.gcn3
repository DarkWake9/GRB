S. Piranomonte (INAF/OARm), D. Malesani (SISSA), H. Navasardyan 
(INAF/OAPd), N. Masetti (INAF/IASF Bo), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060204C (Grupe et al., GCN 4663) with the 
Asiago telescope equipped with the AFOSC camera. Ten exposures lasting 3 
minutes each were acquired, starting on 2006 Feb 4.9009 UT (mean time 
Feb 4.9172 UT, i.e. 1.45 hr after the GRB). The seeing was quite bad 
(~2.4 arcsec).

Visual inspection of the coadded frame reveals no new objects inside the 
whole BAT error circle, after comparison with the DSS-II. The limiting 
magnitude of our images is estimated to be R ~ 21.8 (calibrated against 
the USNO-B1 catalog).

Our images do not cover the position of the XRT source mentioned in GCN 
4672 (Grupe et al., GCN 4672), which lies outside the BAT error circle.
