SUBJECT: GRB 130514B: Further Swift-XRT Observations

B.-B. Zhang (PSU), Dirk Grupe (PSU). D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and J. Kennea (PSU) 
report  on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed 6.8 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst: 
GRB 130514B,  from 314.3 ks to 321.1 ks after the INTERGRAL trigger.
The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. We confirm that 
the X-ray source reported in Zhang et al. GCN 14651 has been faded with 
current count rate of  around 3e-3 count/s.  The light curve can be modeled with  
a power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.98 (+0.27, -0.15). 
We therefore conclude that the X-ray source reported in Zhang et al. GCN 14651 
is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130514B.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
