The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the IceCube-211123A (2021-11-23 14:25:22) the spacecraft
was preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2438 and 2439 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2021-11-23T08:09:55 and
2021-11-23T17:15:45.
