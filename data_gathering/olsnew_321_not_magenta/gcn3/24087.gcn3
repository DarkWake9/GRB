We conducted optical imaging observations for gravitational wave alert S190408an (Singer et al. GCN 24069) with 4 x 40 cm Tsinghua Ma-huateng Telescopes (TMTS) at Xinglong Observatory in Hebei Province, China (40.40° N, 117.58° E). Our observations started at 2019-04-09 19:37 UT and ended at 2019-04-09 20:20 UT, covering about 90% credible region of S190408an observable from Xinglong.  The total sky area scanned by the TMTS  is about 450 deg^2, with each exposure covering the field of view of about 18 deg^2. Our 3σ detection limit is ~19.5 mag for 60s explosure. The center coordinates of our observations are listed below.
