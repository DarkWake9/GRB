Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160801A (trigger #706871)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 19744).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 212.763, 13.485 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  14h 11m 03.2s
    Dec(J2000) = +13d 29' 06.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with ~3 second duration,
peaking at T+0. T90 (15-350 keV) is 2.85 +- 0.41 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.34 to T+1.83 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.85 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
