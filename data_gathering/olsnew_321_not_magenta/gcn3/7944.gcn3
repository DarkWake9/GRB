C. Clemens, S. Loew, J. Greiner, A. Yoldas, T. Kruehler (all MPE Garching), A. 
Kupcu Yoldas (ESO) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest) report on behalf 
of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080703 (Swift trigger 315819; Ziaeepour et al., 
GCN #7936) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, 
PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory 
(Chile).

Observations started at 23:04 UT on July 3rd, 2008, 4.1 hrs after the GRB 
trigger with 4.7 min of effective exposures in g'r'i'z' and 8.0 min in JHK, 
and were performed at an average seeing of 1.8" during astronomical twilight.

We do not detect any object within the 0.5'' Swift-UVOT error circle reported 
by Ward & Ziaeepour (GCN #7941) to the following upper limits:

g' > 22.1 mag,
r' > 22.6 mag,
i' > 21.8 mag,
z' > 21.3 mag,
J > 19.3 mag,
H > 18.1 mag and
K > 17.0 mag.

These upper limits are calibrated against USNO-B1 as well as 2MASS field 
stars.
