The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events
consistent with the sky localization of S190510g-1-Preliminary in a time range of 1000
seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-05-10 02:51:19.292 UTC to 2019-05-10 03:07:59.292 UTC)
during which IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the 90% spatial containment of S190510g calculated from the map
circulated in the preliminary notice. 

IceCube's sensitivity to point sources within the location spanned by the 90% spatial containment of S190510g ranges from
0.029 to 0.806 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
