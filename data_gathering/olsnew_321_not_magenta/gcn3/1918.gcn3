INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), RHESSI, and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at
73606 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 15 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
2.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl (2000)= 347.624, -42.117 degrees, whose radius is
84.182 +/- 0.157 degrees (3 sigma).  

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but at this
stage it is not clear whether this event was observed by
Mars Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be
obtained for it.
