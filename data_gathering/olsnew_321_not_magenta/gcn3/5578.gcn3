Using the data set from T-239 to T+950 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060919 (trigger #230115)
(Guidorzi, et al., GCN Circ. 5575).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 276.900, -50.994 deg {18h 27m 36.0s, -50d 59' 39.8"} (J2000)
+- 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 29%.
 
There is an initial FRED peak starting at T-1 sec, peaking at T+0,
and lasting out to T+5 sec.  There is smaller, 4-sec wide FRED-like peak
starting at T+6 sec.  There is an even smaller, 4-sec wide peak centered
at T+24 sec.  We note that our initial circular using the raw TDRSS rate
lightcurves described a second episode of emission at T+300 sec.
Now using the masked-tagged light curves, this second episode was due
to a noisy detector in the instrument.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.1 +- 0.2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.0 to T+9.0 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.85 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.5 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T-0.49 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
