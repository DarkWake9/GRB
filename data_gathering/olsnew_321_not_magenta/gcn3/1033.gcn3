BeppoSAX GRB ALERT: GRB010412


On Apr. 12, 21:46 U.T. a  GRB has been detected simultaneously by the GRBM and WFC1
aboard BeppoSAX.

Preliminary  coordinates from WFC are:

R.A.(2000)= 294.89
DEC.(2000)= 13.62

The error radius at this stage of analysis is 10'.

We are not planning a follow-up observation of this burst, due to the
on-going pointing of another TOO
