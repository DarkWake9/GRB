D. Xu (DARK/NBI), H.-B. Niu, T.-Z. Yang, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the BAT field of GRB 140606A (Stroh et al., GCN 16353)
using the 1m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China.
Observations started at 15:49:48 UT on 2014/06/06 (4.86 hr after the
burst) and a series of 300s/500s R-band frames were obtained.

The optical afterglow of the burst is not detected within the BAT
error circle down to a limiting magnitude of R=20.8 mag, calibrated
with the nearby SDSS field.
