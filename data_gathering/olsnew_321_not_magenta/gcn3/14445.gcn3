Skynet continued observing the field of GRB 130420A (Page et al., GCN 
14406, Swift trigger #553977) with the 14" GLAST Optical Robotic 
Telescope (GORT) at the Hume Observatory in California. It took 214 80-s 
exposures in Ic at times t=20.48-23.30h and t=26.25-28.56h after burst 
trigger, and 96 80-s exposures in Rc at t=23.33-26.15h. We performed 
photometry on the stacked exposures in each band, calibrated to six SDSS 
stars in the field. We detect the afterglow in both Ic and Rc bands at 
t~24h:

band   exp length   mean time since trig   mag(Vega)
Ic     4.76h        24.37h                 21.04 (+0.43,-0.31)
Rc     2.47h        24.77h                 21.00 (+0.25,-0.21)

As we note in Trotter et al. (GCN 14427), and as Elenin et al. (GCN 
14428) confirm, the afterglow exhibits a rising light curve at early 
times, peaking at t=330s (peak Rc~16, Ic~15.5). After the peak, the 
light curve fades with a power law index alpha~-0.9.
