GRB 051111A : Lulin BVRI multi band afterglow observation

F.Y. Huang, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

" We started BVRI multi band imaging of the GRB 051111A afterglow using
Lulin 1-m telescope at 10:07 UT (4.1 h after the burst). We detected
the optical afterglow clearly in each band. Preliminary analysis of
the R-band image taken at 4.4 h after the burst with 300s exposure
yields R=19.2.

Further observation and analysis are in progress."
