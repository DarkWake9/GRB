C. Guidorzi, R. Margutti, J. Mao (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift began observing the field of the Fermi-LAT GRB 081024B (Omodei et
al., GCN Circ. 8407) 70.3 ks after the trigger. In 9.9 ks of Photon
Counting mode data, we detect three uncatalogued sources within the
Fermi-LAT error circle at the following positions:

Source 1:
RA(J2000):   21 31 47.85
Dec(J2000): +21 08 33.7
with an uncertainty of 6.6 arcsec.

Source 2:
RA(J2000):   21 31 37.22
Dec(J2000): +21 16 32.1
with an uncertainty of 5.4 arcsec.

Source 3:
RA(J2000):   21 31 29.26
Dec(J2000): +21 16 43.3
with an uncertainty of 5.5 arcsec.

Uncertainty radii are given at 90% containment.
All of the sources have count rates of ~1.3e-3 counts/s during this
observation.

It is not possible to determine whether these sources are fading
given the current statistics.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
