report:

At 08:52:40.64 UTC (31960.64 s UT) on 23 August 2003, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2818, an X-Ray Flash.

The burst triggered FREGATE in the 6-80 keV energy band.  The burst
occurred at the extreme edge of the FOV of the WXM Y-detector, and
therefore no flight localization was possible.  Ground analysis of the
WXM data provided a localization that was reported in a GCN Notice at
11:10:20 UT.  The WXM ground localization SNR was 19.  The localization
can be expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle, whose center is at:

WXM-Ground:  R.A. = 21h 30m 46s, Dec. = +21d 55' 43" (J2000),

and whose corners lie at:

R.A. = 21h 31m 02.6s, Dec. = 21d 37' 55"
R.A. = 21h 30m 21.1s, Dec. = 21d 37' 23"
R.A. = 21h 30m 29.0s, Dec. = 22d 13' 30"
R.A. = 21h 31m 10.6s, Dec. = 22d 14' 02" (J2000).

The SXC Y-camera detected the burst, but the X-camera did not.  The SXC
Y-camera localization further constrains the WXM location to an error
box that was reported in a GCN Notice at 12:06:16 UT.  This joint
WXM/SXC localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle,
whose center is at:

SXC/WXM-Ground:  R.A. = 21h 30m 47s, Dec. = +21d 59' 46" (J2000),

and whose corners lie at:

R.A. = 21h 30m 26.9s, Dec. = 22d 01' 44"
R.A. = 21h 30m 25.9s, Dec. = 21d 57' 14"
R.A. = 21h 31m 07.4s, Dec. = 22d 02' 17"
R.A. = 21h 31m 06.5s, Dec. = 21d 57' 50" (J2000).

The T90 duration of the burst was 56 seconds in the WXM 2-25 keV energy
band.  The peak flux of the burst in 1 second is 4.5 x 10-8 erg cm-2
s-1 in the 7-30 keV energy band and 5.5 x 10-8 erg cm-2 s-1 in the
30-400 keV energy band.  The fluence of the burst is 2.3 x 10-6 erg
cm-2 and 1.5 x 10-6 erg cm-2 in the same energy bands, respectively.
Thus S(2-30 keV)/S(30-400 keV) = 1.5, making this burst an X-ray flash.
