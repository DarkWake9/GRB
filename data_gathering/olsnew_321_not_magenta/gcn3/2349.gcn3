TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 56866 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 70 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.8E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 159.079,  24.559 degrees, whose radius is 59.486 +/-  0.052
degrees (3 sigma).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -19 and -7 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl= 95.6, +16.3 and 100.8,
+4.0 degrees, and between RA, Decl.=191.7, -25.7, and 202.6, -17.0 degrees.

These error boxes may be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
