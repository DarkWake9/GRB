The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:43:31 UT on 25 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200125B (trigger 601677816.188054 / 200125864).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 7.5, Dec = 64.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 30m, 64d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
