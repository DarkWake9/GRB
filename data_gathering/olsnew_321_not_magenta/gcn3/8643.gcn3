Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the SWIFT-UVOT refined position of the GRB 081121 optical
afterglow (GCN 8544) at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) between 01:15:05 UT, November 24, 2008 and 20:35:30
UT, November 25, 2008.

We did not detect a radio source at the optical afterglow position of
the GRB 081121 (GCN 8544). The data at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz were merged
and the radio flux density at the afterglow position found out to be
0.106 +/- 0.208 mJy/beam (1-sigma).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
