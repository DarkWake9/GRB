report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 00:34:46.95 UT on 20 October 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 161020A (trigger 498616490/161020024),
which was also detected by INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., GCN 20086).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 117 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 12.3 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.1 s to T0+3.1 s is adequately
fit by a simple power law function with index -1.74 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.49 +/- 0.14)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.1s in the 10-1000 keV band is 2.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
