K. Hurley and J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER
GRB team,

S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The MESSENGER neutron spectrometer, which also serves as a GRB
detector, was turned on recently and has begun to detect bursts.
In particular, it detected GRB070201 (Golenetskii et al., GCN 6088,
6094; Pal'shin et al., GCN 6098).  We have now triangulated this
burst to the following error box using MESSENGER, Konus-Wind,
and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS data: 

-----------------------------------------------------
    RA, deg                     Dec, deg
-----------------------------------------------------
Center:
 11.089 (00h 44m 21s)   +42.308 (+42d 18' 27")

Corners:
  11.338 (00h 45m 21s)   +42.297 (+42d 17' 50")
  10.223 (00h 40m 53s)   +43.210 (+43d 12' 36")
  10.840 (00h 43m 22s)   +42.317 (+42d 19' 02")
  11.949 (00h 47m 48s)   +41.375 (+41d 22' 31")
----------------------------------------------------

As the onboard software is still undergoing verification,
this result should be considered preliminary.

The error box area is 0.325 sq. deg.  The center of the box is 
1.1 degrees from the center of M31, and includes its spiral 
arms.  This lends support to the idea that this exceptionally
intense burst may have originated in that galaxy (Perley and
Bloom, GCN 6091).
