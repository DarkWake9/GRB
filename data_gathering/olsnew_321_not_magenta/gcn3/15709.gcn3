G. Younes (USRA/NASA-MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 17:18:42.99 UT on 08 January 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140108A (trigger 410894325/140108721), which was
also detected with Swift (J. L. Racusin et al., GCN 15699). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift/XRT location of the burst
(P. Evans et al., GCN 15705). The angle to the Fermi LAT boresight is 87 degrees
from the Swift XRT position.

The GBM light curve consists of a multiple-peak structure with a duration
(T90) of about 95 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0 to T0+105 s is adequately fit by a Comptonized function with Epeak =
240 +/- 23 keV, and an index alpha = -1.24 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.905 +/- 0.069)E-05  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+85 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 10.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
