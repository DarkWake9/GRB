J. Greiner (MPE Garching), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), and S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift team:

The location of Swift trigger 873178, which was previously identified as GRB 181123A
(Lien et al., GCN Circ. 23431 and 23442), is only 0.3 arcmin away from the XRT location
of the recently discovered transient, Swift J1858.6-0814 (Kennea et al. ATEL 12160;
Krimm et al., ATEL 12151). Therefore, we believe that the Swift trigger 873178 is
a flare from Swift J1858.6-0814, instead of a new GRB.

This flare is also seen in the BAT transient monitor (Krimm et al. 2013;
https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/SWIFTJ1858.6-0814/).
