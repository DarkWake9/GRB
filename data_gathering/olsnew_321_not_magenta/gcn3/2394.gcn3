report:


We have observed the error box of GRB030913 (Suzuki et al.,
GCNC 2383) with MASTER system (GCN 2385, http://observ.pereplet.ru)
equipped with new AP16E CCD during the first night after the GRB. 25
frames, obtained during first 4 hours after the burst, were combined to
achieve the better magnitude limit (the first image was obtained 43
minutes after GRB time).

No new sources were detected up to 17.5 unfiltered instrumental magnitude
with S/N ratio of 3.

The part of processed frame is available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/grb030913OT.gif. North is up, east is
left.

Position of possible OT, reported by Guziy et al. (GCN 2391) is marked on
the image. No source brighter than 17.5 is seen there.
