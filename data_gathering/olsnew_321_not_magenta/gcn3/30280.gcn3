M. Shrestha (Liverpool JMU),  A. Gomboc (Univ. Nova Gorica), C. Guidorzi (Univ. Ferrara) ,  S. Kobayashi (LJMU), A. Melandri (INAF), C. Mundell (Univ. Bath), R. Smith (LJMU) , I.A. Steele (LJMU), report on behalf of a wider collaboration:



We observed the field of Swift GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 30261; Jelinek et al. GCN 30263; Lipunov et al. GCN 30259; Zhao et al. GCN 30261; Kong et al. GCN 30265; Axelsson et al. GCN 30270; de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 30272; Zheng et al. GCN 30273; Blazek et al. GCN 30274; Kann et al. GCN 30275; Svinkin et al. GCN 30276; Xin et al. GCN 30277; Perley et al. GCN 30271 ) with the 2.0m Liverpool Telescope (LT), La Palma on 2021 June 20 starting at 00:21:14.141 UT for a period of 2 hours using the MOPTOP optical imaging polarimeter in the r’ band.  Data was calibrated with respect to nearby APASS secondary standard stars.



We confirm the optical counterpart reported by Swift UVOT (GCN 30261).



At T=1318 seconds after the BAT trigger time, we measure r’ = 16.1 mag.  Detailed analysis is ongoing.
