K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Konus and RHESSI observed this soft-spectrum burst at 72247 s on May 19
2004.  Ulysses was off.  Its duration was 1.3 s, its fluence was ~2.8 x
10^-5 erg/cm^2, and its peak flux was ~3.3 x 10^-5 erg/cm^2 s.  We have
triangulated it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=250.249,
-19.744 degrees, whose radius is 20.792  +/-  2.019 degrees.  As the
center line of this annulus passes only 0.2 degrees from the position
of SGR1806-20, we believe that it is the source of this event.
