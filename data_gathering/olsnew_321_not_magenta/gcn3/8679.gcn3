DATE:    08/12/18 17:05:04 GMT
FROM:    Rob Preece at UAH  <Rob.Preece@nasa.gov>

Robert Preece (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The correct event fluence for the GRB detection reported
in Circular Number 8678 should be:
(5.44 +/- 0.07)E-5 erg/cm^2 in the energy interval 8-1000 kev
for times -T0-1.79 s to T0+13.57 s. Thanks to Alexander Kann
at TLS Tautenburg for spotting the error."
