Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:01:48.70 UT on 13 February 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150213A (trigger 445478511 / 150213001).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is RA = 95.29,
DEC = -4.85 (J2000 degrees), with an uncertainty of 1.0 degrees (radius,
1-sigma containment,statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). This trigger
resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was accepted and the
spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. The angle from the Fermi
LAT boresight at trigger time is 77 degrees.


The GBM light curve consists of a single main FRED-like peak
with a duration (T90) of about 4.1 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.5 s to T0+4.6 s is
best fit by a a Band function with Epeak = 57.8 +/- 0.6 keV,
alpha = -1.1+/- 0.02, and beta = -2.6 +/- 0.03. The event fluence
(10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.78 +/- 0.02)E-05 erg/cm^2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+1.76 s in the
10-1000 keV band is 189.0 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
