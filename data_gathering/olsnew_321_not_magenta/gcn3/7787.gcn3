P. M. Woods (Dynetics, Inc/NSSTC), T. Sakamoto (CRESST/UMBC/GSFC), 
Y. Nakagawa (RIKEN), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (GSFC), 
E. Gogus (Sabanci Univ), K. Hurley (UC Berkeley/SSL), 
C. Kouveliotou (MSFC/NSSTC), D. Palmer (LANL), on behalf of 
a large ToO collaboration, report:

Chandra target-of-opportunity (ToO) observation of SGR 1627-41 has been 
approved and scheduled for 40 ks.  The scheduled Chandra observation 
window is following:

Start Time: 06/03/08 10:35 UT
Stop  Time: 06/03/08 21:42 UT

RXTE is planning to monitor SGR 1627-41 during this Chandra ToO period.  
Swift will maximize the amount of time that SGR1627-41 is in the BAT 
field of view during the Chandra viewing period.  

The scheduling of contemporaneous observations at other wavelengths 
is strongly encouraged.
