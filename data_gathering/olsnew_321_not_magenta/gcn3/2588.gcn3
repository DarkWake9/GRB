report:

At 13:01:46 UTC (46906 s UT) on 11 May 2004, the HETE FREGATE, WXM, and 
SXC instruments detected event GRB040511 (=H3218), a long, bright GRB.

The burst triggered FREGATE in the 30-400 keV energy band.  A flight
localization was distributed automatically 39 minutes after the trigger:
the long delay was due to dropouts in the HETE Burst Alert Network.
Subsequent analysis of the full data set revealed that the prompt WXM
Y location was in error:  the correct WXM localization is a box with 
corners located at

  RA = 14h 47m 30.2s, Dec = -44d 15m 00s
  RA = 14h 48m 43.2s, Dec = -44d 11m 42s
  RA = 14h 49m 09.1s, Dec = -44d 41m 13s
  RA = 14h 47m 55.9s, Dec = -44d 44m 34s (J2000).

Analysis of the SXC data reveal a 90% confidence  error region of 
80" radius (5.6 sq. arcmin area) centered at:

  SXC-Ground:  RA = 14h 47m 50s, Dec = -44d 15' 04" (J2000).

Preliminary analyses of the burst spectrum give a value of Epeak of
~100 keV and a 30-400 keV fluence of ~1e-5 erg/cm2, with a SNR of 32.2 
and a duration (t90) of 38 s.
