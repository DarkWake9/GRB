W. Zheng (UC Berkeley), H. Flewelling (IfA/Hawaii), T. Guver (Sabanci
U), F. Yuan (Australian National University), report on behalf of the
ROTSE collaboration: 

Further analysis of ROTSE-IIIb data revealed that the OT of GRB 130215A
(Swift trigger 548760; D'Elia et al., GCN 14204; Zheng et al GCN 14205;
LaCluyze et al. 14206) peaked around 750s after the burst, followed with
a single power-law decay with index alpha = -1.24 up to ~4ks after the
burst. Observation is on going.
 
Interestingly the GRB is also triggered by Fermi-GBM (trigger
382584689). The GBM trigger arrived ~600s earlier than Swift-BAT trigger
and ROTSE-IIIb responded to GBM trigger at first. A 4x4 tiling follow-up
mode was performed before BAT-trigger interrupted it and a total of 22
images were obtained to GBM trigger. Unfortunately, our effort of the
tiling follow-up still didn't cover the OT location in these images
since the GBM trigger is about 3.78 degree away, just a bit away from
one of the corner.
