A. A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL) and J. K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations 162s after the trigger in M31
reported by Barthelmy et al. (GCN Circ. 16332).
At the position given in that GCN we are now able to report the full
range of magnitudes from the initial data. The source does not seem to
be fading and these magnitudes are consistent with the archival data
reported by Siegel (GCN Circ. 16333). This is consistent with the 
conclusion drawn by Page et al. (GCN Circ. 16336).

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT
photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for
the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06 in the direction of the
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
