report on behalf of the One-Meter Two Hemisphere (1M2H) collaboration:

in the process of following up galaxies in the localization region of LIGO/Virgo collaboration event S190814bv (GCN #25324) provided in the updated map of GCN #25333, we observed the following fields with the 0.7-m Thacher telescope at the Thacher School Observatory on UT 2019 August 15.  Each field represents a 3 minute r-band image.  The approximate center of each image is noted in the table below, and the field of view is a 21 arcmin x 21 arcmin rectangle.  We also note the approximate 3-sigma limiting magnitude of each pointing.

Comparing our images to PS1 r-band images of the same fields, we did not detect any transient sources.
