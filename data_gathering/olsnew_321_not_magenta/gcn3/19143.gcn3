A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), C.C. Thoene (IAA-CSIC),
V. Casanova (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the possibly short GRB 160303A (Beardmore et al., 
GCN 19126) with the 1.5 m OSN telescope (Sierra Nevada Observatory, 
Granada, Spain). Observation consisted of 15x300s exposures in R-band, 
ranging from 01:37-3:00 UT (mean epoch at 15.41 hr after the burst).

In the combined image the GRB afterglow (Butler et al., GCN 19131; Emery 
et al. GCN 19134; de Ugarte Postigo, GCN 19136; Jeong et al. GCN19140; 
Im et al. GCN 19141; Klose et al. GCN 19142) is seen at a magnitude of 
r(AB) = 23.67 +/- 0.27 as compared to SDSS stars.

This seems to indicate confirm the decay as compared with the data of 
RATIR (Butler et al., GCN 19131), NOT (de Ugarte Postigo, GCN 19136) and
CQUEAN (Jeong et al. GCN19140), BOAO (Im et al. GCN 19141) and FORS
(Klose et al. GCN 19142). In any case the possible decay would be shallower
than the typical GRB, with a decay slope of alpha ~ 0.5 (F_nu ~ t^-alpha).
