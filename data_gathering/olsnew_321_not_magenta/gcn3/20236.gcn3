report on behalf of the POLAR team:

At 2016-11-29T07:11:40.00 UT(T0), during a routine

on-ground search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 161129A,

which was also observed by the Swift/BAT (trigger

#724438), Fermi/GBM (trigger 502096303/161129300), and

Astrosat/CZTI (V. Sharma et al., GCN Circ. 20214). The

detection of this GRB happened on the tail of a big Solar Flare.

The POLAR light curve consists of multiple peaks

with a duration (T90) of 41.5 s measured from T0+3.75 s.

The 500-ms peak flux, measured from T0+27.25 s, is 705.7

cnts/sec. The above measurements are in the preliminary

calculated energy range of about 80 â€“ 500 keV.

The incident angle at T0 in POLAR detector coordinate is:

theta:  42.6   [deg]

phi:    52.3   [deg]

These direction is computed using the best location from

the Swift/BAT, which is (J2000):

RA:   316.221  [deg]

Dec:  32.137   [deg]

Err:  1.8      [arcmin]

The distribution of the GRB signal among its 25 detector

modules is also consistent with this incident geometry.

Preliminary calculations of the MDP show that a

polarimetric measurement of this burst can be attempted.


The analysis results presented above are preliminary. The

calibration work is ongoing.


POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which was

launchedon-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2

(TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016.The energy detection range of POLAR

is ~ 50-500 keV.More information about POLAR can be found
