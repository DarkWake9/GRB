CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al,
2020, arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 210826A, which
was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger no. 210826293, GCN 30716) and
Fermi-LAT (Ohno et al., GCN 30721).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-08-26 07:01:53.50 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with
the burst is 183 (+45, -24) cts/s above the background in the combined
data of four quadrants, with a total of 2161 (+327, -549) cts. The local
mean background count rate was 560 (+4, -2) cts/s. Using cumulative
rates, we measure a T90 of 24 (+17, -10) s.

It was also detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the
100-500 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of
emission with the strongest peak at 2021-08-26 07:01:47.03 UT. The
measured peak count rate is 200 (+95, -5) cts/s above the background in
the combined Veto data of four quadrants, with a total of 1953 (+648,
-720) cts. The local mean background count rate was 1907 (+6, -6) cts/s.
We measure a T90 of 14 (+8, -5) s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb [1]. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and
facilitated the project.
