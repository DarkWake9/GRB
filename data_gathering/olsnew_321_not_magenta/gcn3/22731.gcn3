A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), D. Malesani (DAWN/NBI and DARK/NBI), P. Montanes-Rodriguez (IAC), and P. Sorensen (NOT) report:

We observed the field of GRB 180514A (LaPorte et al. GCN 22723) with the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with AlFOSC. The observation consisted of 3x300s exposures in r-band and 5x200s in z-band. The integrations started at 23:22 UT, 9.95 hr after the burst.

No credible counterpart is detected in any of the two bands within the XRT error box. For the r-band image we derive a 3-sigma limit of r > 23.8 mag, calibrated with respect to SDSS field stars.
