The 1 m Zadko Telescope team observed the field of GRB 090509  
(trigger=351525,
D. Grupe et al. GCN 9325) 8hr after the Swift trigger.

We stacked 48x5s unfiltered images of the field from
13:10:32 to 13:24:16 UT (2009-05-09)

No candidate afterglow was observed at the GROND position (GCN 9326)  
nor at
the BAT-refined position (GCN 9349), down to an Rmag of approx. 17.6.  
(The OA
magnitude limit was estimated by comparing nearby USNO-B1 reference  
stars.)

The Zadko Telescope is currently being commissioned.
