TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14175
SUBJECT: GRB 130131A - UKIRT confirmation of afterglow
DATE:    13/02/01 14:27:41 GMT

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick), T.  Wold (JACH)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We re-observed the field of GRB 130131A with the WFCAM camera on
UKIRT, beginning approximately 20.5 hr post-burst.  The source reported
by us previously (GCN 14157) is no longer detected in our provisional
reduction, indicating a fading of at least 2 mag in the K-band.  This confirms
the source as the afterglow of the GRB (consistent also with the radio detection
by Zauderer et al. GCN 14171).

We also report that the afterglow was faintly visible in a Z-band image
taken at UKIRT 2hr post-burst (in morning twilight), indicating that this
is likely not an extreme redshift event.
