Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140927A (trigger #613775)
(Starling, et al., GCN Circ. 16842).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 291.802, -65.400 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  19h 27m 12.5s
  Dec(J2000) = -65d 23' 58.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 54%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starts at ~ T0 and
ends at ~ T+9 s. The structure has roughly two main peaks, at ~ T+3.8 s and ~ T+7.7 s,
respectively. T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.26 +- 1.43 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.43 to T+8.70 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.82 +- 0.30.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.7 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.70 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
