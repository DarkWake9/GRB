C. Pagani (PSU), D. Morris (PSU), D. Grupe (PSU) and D. Burrows (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed the first two orbits of Swift XRT data of GRB 060313 (Pagani et
al., GCN 4867). The revised XRT position is

RA(J2000) = 04h 26m 28.5s
Dec(J2000) = -10d 50m 40.2s

We estimate an uncertainty of 4 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
The revised position is 2 acrseconds from the suggested optical afterglow
reported by Levan et al. (GCN 4871) and 1.5 arcseconds form the previously
reported XRT position (GCN 4870).

The X-ray spectrum of the data can be fitted by a single absorbed power law with
a photon index Gamma=1.70+/-0.10 and an absorption column density nH consistent
with the Galactic value of 4.7e20cm-2; Dickey & Lockman 1990.

The light curve shows a decay during with alpha=1.50+/-0.18. Assuming this decay
slope the prediction for the flux 24 hours after the trigger is 1.2e-13
ergs/s/cm2.
