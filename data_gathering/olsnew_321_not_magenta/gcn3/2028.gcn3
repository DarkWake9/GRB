V.Rumyantsev, E.Pavlenko, O.Antoniuk (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We continue to monitor the OT of GRB030329 (GCN  2025).

The OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985) is clearly visible in our
image taken
with Cassegrain 38-cm telescope of CrAO.Several 180 sec. exposures of  R
(Johnson) filter were obtained. Based on filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN
2023)  we estimate the OT magnitude as

Mid Time (UT)          exposure      OT

March, 30 17:56:25     1x180 s      R = 16.61

The figure image can be found in http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB030329/

Detailed calibration and observations are continuing.
