A. Price (AAVSO) reports on behalf of the AAVSO International GRB Network:

The AAVSO International GRB Network has obtained B, V, R, and unfiltered
photometry of the afterglow to GRB030329 from numerous sources across the
globe over the past 3 days. See notes for details and access to time
series data.

Berto Monard, South Africa
  Unfiltered = 14.06 @ 2003.03.29 17:15 to
  Unfiltered = 15.01 @ 2003.03.29 23:37
  exposures: 317X45-60s 

Arto Oksanen, 0.4m at Nyrola Observatory, Finland
  R = 14.50 @ 2003.03.29 20:22:23 to
  R = 14.75 @ 2003.03.29 22:28:03
  exposures: 10X120s (out of 148 total)

  exposure: 1800s

Peter Brown, 0.41m at Orson Pratt Observatory, Brigham Young
University, Utah USA

  R = 16.2 @ 2003.03.30 10:41
  exposures: 1X300s 

Dan Kaiser, 0.35m at Crescent Moon Observatory, Indiana USA
  V = 16.62 2003.03.31 01:32:04 to
  V = 16.97 2003.03.31 06:18:06
  R = 16.26 2003.03.31 02:10:12 to
  R = 16.53 2003.03.31 06:22:37

Bill Aquino, 0.3m with Buffalo Astronomical Association in 
New York, USA

  exposures: 4X180s exposure 

Notes:
 * Detailed reports (observing equipment, location, conditions, etc.)  
and many original FITS files available at
ftp://ftp.aavso.org/grb/GRB030329 or by e-mailing aavso@aavso.org.
 * Brown, Kaiser, Monard, and Oksanen have time series data spanning the
observations posted here. Full data has already been or will be posted
soon to the URL above.
 * Aquino, Kaiser, and Oksanen used comparison star photometry from Henden
et al. (GCN 2023). Brown used comp star A described on the finder chart by
Rumyantsev et al. (GCN 2005). Schrabback et al. used comp star A described
on a different finder chart by Martini et al.(GCN 2012). Monard's comp
star is from USNOA2, 14.0R, 3' NNE of GRB.
  * The decay rate in Monard's exposure varies from 0.191 CR/h in the
beginning of the run to 0.103 CR/h at the end. Kaiser's time series data
is fairly constant until about 5:40 when the OT begins to fade again.

  The CCD used by Oksanen plus other components of the AAVSO International
GRB network were funded by a generous grant from the Curry Foundation.
