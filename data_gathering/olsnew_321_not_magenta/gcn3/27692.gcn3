The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:41:08 UT on 6 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200506C (trigger 610450873.980628 / 200506404).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 190.9, Dec = 40.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 43m, 40d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
