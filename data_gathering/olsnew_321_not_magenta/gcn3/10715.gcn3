Adria C. Updike and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100504A (Mao et al., GCN 10712) using the
0.6m SARA-South telescope located at CTIO under good conditions and high
airmass beginning 6 hours and 42 min after the trigger.  We do not detect
a new source at the location of the UVOT-enhanced XRT position (Mao, GCN
10713) to a limiting magnitude of R = 20 mag (on comparison to the USNO
B1.0 catalog).  We note that the extinction at this galactic latitude is
significant; E(B-V) = 0.840 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
