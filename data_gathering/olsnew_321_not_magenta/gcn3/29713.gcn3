The short GRB 210323A (Swift-BAT detection:  Gropp et al., GCN 29699;
Fermi-GBM detection: Hamburg & Meegan, GCN 29709)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=79334.600 s UT (22:02:14.600).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with the total duration of ~0.45 s (20-1500 keV).
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB210323_T79334/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a fluence of 1.57(-0.25,+0.50)x10^-6 erg/cm^2 and
a 16-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0-0.016 s,
of 1.23(-0.20,+0.36)x10^-5 erg/cm^2/s (both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the brightest part of the burst emission was detected before the trigger,
the spectral analysis was performed using the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modelling the time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0-0.128 to T0+0.320 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep),
yields alpha = -1.03(-0.17,+0.18) and Ep = 632(-167,+442) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 68% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
