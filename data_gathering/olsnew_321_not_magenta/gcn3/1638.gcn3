We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB021004,
originally reported by Fox et al., GCN 1564, with the
SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO.  We obtained 16 300s 
exposures in the Johnson R band filter.  Observations
began at 06:46:17UT, and ended at 08:09:02UT, on October 
9th.  The observations were carried out under good seeing
conditions.  Aperature photometry was performed, and 
calibrated utilizing standards reported by Henden et al.,
GCN 1583.

We find a mean R magnitude of 21.2 +- 0.2
