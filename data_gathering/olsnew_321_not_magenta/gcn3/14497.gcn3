Skynet observed the Swift/XRT localization of GRB 130427A (Maselli et 
al., GCN 14448, Swift trigger #554620) with four 16" telescopes of the 
PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile, starting at 2013-04-27, 23:28 UT, and 
continuing until 04-28, 05:30 UT (t=15.69h-21.67h post-trigger). It took 
~124 160-s exposures, simultaneously in each of the BVRI bands. We 
performed photometry on each exposure, calibrated to two SDSS stars in 
the field. We detect a fading afterglow in BVRI at the position reported 
by Elenin et al. (GCN 14450), which is ~50" south of the initial XRT 
localization.

A preliminary light curve of the first night's data is at:

Further Skynet observations are ongoing.
