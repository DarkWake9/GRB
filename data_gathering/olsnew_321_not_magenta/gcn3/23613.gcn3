The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:


IceCube has performed a search for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction

of IceCube-190104A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/23605.gcn3) in a time range of 2 days centered on the alert

event time (2019-01-03 08:34:38 UTC to 2019-01-05 08:34:38 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding

the event that prompted the alert, 3 additional track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the

90% PSF containment of IceCube-190104A. We find that these 3 additional events are well described by atmospheric

background expectations, with a p-value of 1.0. Accordingly, these data would represent a time-integrated

muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 3.98 x 10^-4 TeV cm^-2

for this observation period.


A subsequent search was performed to include the previous month of data (2018-12-04 08:34:38 UTC to 2019-01-05 08:34:38 UTC).

In this case, we also report a p-value of 1.0, consistent with no significant excess of track events, and a corresponding

time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 1.29 x 10^-3 TeV cm^-2.


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
