Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110207A (trigger #444912)
(Littlejohns, et al., GCN Circ. 11658).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 12.540, -10.790 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 50m 09.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 47' 23.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows at least seven short peaks starting
at ~T-0.1 sec and ending at ~T+20 sec with a long decay extending out
to ~T+110 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 80.3 +- 16.2 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+108.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.30 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
