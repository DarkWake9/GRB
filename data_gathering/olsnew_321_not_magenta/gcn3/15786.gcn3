A. Oksanen, P. Kehusmaa and C. Harlingten on behalf of Searchlight Observatory Network report:

We detect an afterglow candidate on Rc filtered images taken at 2014-02-06T08:33:09 with 
a 40 cm robotic telescope located in New Mexico, USA.

R.A. = 09 41 20 (J2000.0)
Decl = 66 45 38

The position matches with the XRT position given by A. Y. Lien et. al (GCN 15784).

Approximate magnitude R=18, seem to be fading. Observations and analysis is ongoing.
