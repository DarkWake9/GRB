E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and W. Krzeminski (Las Campanas
Observatory) report:

"We imaged the 4-arcmin radius error circle of GRB 050202 (GCN 3005) with
the Swope 40-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory on February 2.40
UT (6 hours after the burst) in R-band.  Observations were taken at high
airmass and with a high sky background (as the Sun was rising) and as a
result reach a limit of only R~16 mag.  To this limit we do not find any
objects within or near the error circle which are not present in the DSS.  
We note that with a time delay of six hours, this limit is of similar
quality to any of the limits obtained to date (Hurley et al. 2002, ApJ,
567, 447)"
