The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:44:10 UT on 30 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200530A (trigger 612492255.567684 / 200530031).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 17.3, Dec = 71.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 09m, 71d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 37.0 degrees.
