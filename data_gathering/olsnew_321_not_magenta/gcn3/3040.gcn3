White, N. Gehrels (GSFC), B. Zhang (U. Nevada), report on behalf of the 
Swift XRT team:

We report a refined XRT position for GRB 050219a (Romano et al. 2005, GCN 
3036; Hullinger et al. 2005, GCN 3038), based on ground-processing of XRT 
Photon-Counting mode data taken during the first orbit after the 
burst.  The refined position is:

RA(J2000) = 11:05:38.8,
Dec(J2000) = -40:40:58.3.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6.3 arcseconds.

The lightcurve of this burst is fading, with a steep power-law up to about 
200 s post-burst and a shallower power law at later times.

Swift observations of this burst ended at 21:05:36.00 UT, when the Swift 
BAT triggered on GRB 050219b, which replaced GRB 050219a as the new GRB 
target in the on-board schedule.
