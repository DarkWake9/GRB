We observed the location of GRB 130831A (Hagen et al., GCN Circ.
15139) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 14:13 UT
on 2013-08-31, corresponding to 69 minutes after the burst trigger.
Exposures totaling 2.0 hours were made in good weather conditions.
No source was detected, with a preliminary RMS of 1.4 mJy/beam at
850 microns and 13.7 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Callie McNew for the prompt support of these observations.
