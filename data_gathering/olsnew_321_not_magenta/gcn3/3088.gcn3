E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories), S.B. Cenko and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech)  
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We obtained spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 050126 with the Echelle
Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) mounted on the Keck II telescope.  
Inspection of the 2-d and extracted spectra reveals a single emission line
at an observed wavelength of 8536.5 angstrom with continuum emission both
redward and blueward of the line.  Interpreted as [OII]3727 this indicates
a redshift of z=1.29, the first for any Swift GRB.  At this redshift,
given a fluence of 2e-6 erg/cm^2 (Berger et al. astro-ph/0502468), the
isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy is 8.7e51 erg."
