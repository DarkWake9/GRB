SUBJECT: GRB 140110A: Swift XRT observations

A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA), S. Campana (INAF-OAB), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) 
and P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT has observed the error circle of the Fermi/LAT GRB 140110A 
(Bissaldi et al., GCN 15714), also detected by Fermi/GBM (von Kienlin & 
Connaughton, GCN 15716), in a series of observations tiled on the sky. 
The total exposure time is 12.8 ks spread over 7 fields; the maximum 
exposure within the sky observed was 3.9 ks. The observations started 
28.4 ks after the Fermi/LAT trigger. Within these data there are two 
objects (source #1 and source #3) which are in the 1RXS catalogue and 
five sources which are not catalogued in X-rays. At the present time we 
cannot be sure which of these, if any, is the afterglow. However, we 
note that the light curve of source #2, with a mean count rate of (1.23 
± 0.27) x 10^-2 ct s^-1, suggests evidence of decay.
