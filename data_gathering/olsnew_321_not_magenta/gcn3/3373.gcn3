M. Jelinek, A. J. Castro-Tirado, J. Gorosabel, A. de Ugarte Postigo, 
S. Guziy (IAA-CSIC Granada), P. Kubanek, R. Hudec (Astronomical 
Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Ondrejov), and S. Vitek 
(Czech Technical University), report:

"The BOOTES-1 very wide field camera, located at Estacion de
Sondeos Atmosfericos (INTA-CEDEA) in Huelva (Spain), observed
the region of the sky containing the SWIFT/BAT error box for 
GRB 050505 (Hurkett et al. GCN 3360) as part of its routine
observing schedule. A 30 s exposure started at 23:22:00 UT 
(21 s prior to the onset of the 90 s long burst), with the
following frame starting at 23:23:00 UT (i.e. covering the late
part of the event). A limiting (unfiltered, airmass 1.6)
magnitude of 9.2 is derived for any prompt optical flash
arising from this event."
