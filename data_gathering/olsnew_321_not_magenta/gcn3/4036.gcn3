" We have imaged the entire error region of GRB 050925 (Holland et
al. GCN 4034) using 0.8-m telescope at XingLong Observatory, China.
The I-band observations were performed form 11.27 UT to 11.78 UT (~
2.19 to 2.70 hours after the burst). Compare with DSS-II images, no
new source was found in our co-add image (300s x 6). The limiting
magnitude is I~ 20.6, in comparison with USNO-B1.0 stars(S/N=3). The
extinction in I is about 4.1 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
