on behalf of the BeppoSAX Team report:
 
The BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments observed the region of GRB990704 
(GCN #366) from July 5.064 to July 5.989 UT. The observation was then 
stopped to allow the follow-up observation of GRB990705.
One previously unknown X-ray source (1SAX J1219.5-0350) was found
inside the 7' BeppoSAX WFC error-circle (GCN #366) at a position (J2000) 
R.A. = 12h19m27s.3 Decl.= -03o50'22", error radius 1' (90% confidence
level). The average source flux in 2-10 keV was (8.0+-0.6)x10E-3 counts/s, 
corresponding to about 4.4x10E-13 erg cmE-2 sE-1, assuming a power
law spectrum.
The source shows a fading behaviour, strongly suggesting it is the 
X-ray afterglow of GRB990704.
