We observed the field of GRB 150213B (Pagani, et al., GCN 17464) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/02 14.41 to 2015/02 14.55 UTC (11.27 to
14.72 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.58 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-UVOT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r = 22.4 +/- 0.6
  i = 22.1 +/- 0.1
  z > 20.50

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San
Pedro Mártir.
