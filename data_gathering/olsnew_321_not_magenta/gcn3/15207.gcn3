FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 130907A afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at September 9 09.99 UT to
20.69 UT, i.e. 1.51 - 1.96 days after the burst (GCN 15183).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 0.19 +/- 0.03 mJy
at the position of the optical counterpart (GCN 15187).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for quickly scheduling and
obtaining these observations."
