report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:34:58.00 UT on 12 September 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located a short GRB 130912A (trigger 400667700 / 130912358),
which was also detected by the Swift (D'Elia et al., GCN 15212).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102 deg from Swift/XRT 
position (Beardmore et al. GCN 15217).

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 0.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.448 s is
well fit by a Band function with alpha = -1.0 +/- 0.1, beta = -1.9 +/- 0.2
and Epeak= 1225 +/- 599 keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.29 +/- 0.14)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.13 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
