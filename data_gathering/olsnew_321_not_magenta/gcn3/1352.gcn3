J. P. Halpern, S. Gezari, N. Mirabal (Columbia U.) report for the
MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"Using the MDM 1.3m, we started a series of R-band exposures covering
the error circle of BeppoSAX GRB 020409 (GCN #1347) on April 11 02:57 UT,
or 30 hours after the burst.  While these images are deeper than the
POSS II limit, no new object brighter than those on the POSS II is seen. 
Observations are continuing."
