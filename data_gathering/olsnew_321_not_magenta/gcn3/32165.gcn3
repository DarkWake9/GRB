The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:03:28 UT on 6 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220606B (trigger 676170213.675398 / 220606044).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 22.4, Dec = -50.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 29m, -50d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
