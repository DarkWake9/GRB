behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and HETE (FREGATE and WXM)  observed this GRB at
40308 seconds.  Its duration was approximately 20 seconds.

As the two triangulation annuli (Ulysses/HETE and Ulysses/Odyssey) are
practically coincident, the IPN localization can best be expressed as
a single annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=350.299, -15.584 degrees, whose
radius is 42.882 +/- 0.076 degrees.

GRB031109 was detected by HETE as trigger H2917.  The burst was detected 
just a few seconds after the start of FREGATE and WXM operations:  it is seen
as a two-peaked burst with a hard spectrum (Epeak > 300 keV) and a 25-100 keV
fluence of 3E-6 erg/cm2.  The burst occurred well before the onset of star 
tracker operations, so the satellite aspect at the time of the trigger is
not well known:  the HETE localization is a circle of 10 degree radius centered
at RA = 21h 35m, dec = 25d 30'.

The IPN annulus intersects this circle at four points to form an error
box whose area is approximately 7900 sq. arcmin.  The intersection
points are:

     RA(2000)    DEC(2000)
     320.708      15.912
     334.747      24.605
     320.885      15.865
     334.721      24.431

A map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/031109.  HETE
lightcurves and the results of automated spectral analyses can be found
on the HETE web page http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/GRB031109a.
This error box may be improved.
