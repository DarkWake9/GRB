GRB 060413: No Optical Afterglow in Swift/UVOT TDRSS Data

Padi Boyd (GRFC), R. E. Weigand (GSFC), Stephen T. Holland (GSFC/USRA)
and Alex Blustin (MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

      UVOT took a finding chart exposure of GRB 060413 (Pagani et
al. 2006, GCN Circular 4957).  The exposure length was 400 seconds
with the V filter starting 960 seconds after the BAT trigger.  No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products.  The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers the entire XRT error circle.  The 3-sigma
upper limit inside the XRT error circle is 19.2 mag.  We note that
this GRB occurred at a Galactic latitude of -1.04 degrees and the
estimated Galactic reddening along this line of sight is E_{B-V} =
1.95 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
