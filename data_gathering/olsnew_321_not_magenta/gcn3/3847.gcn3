NUMBER:  3847
SUBJECT: GRB050820A: Radio Observation
DATE:    05/08/21 19:51:46 GMT

P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We have undertaken VLA observations at a frequency of 8.46 GHz toward
GRB 050820A (GCN 3830) on August 20.39 UT and 21.20 UT, about 2.9 hrs
and 22.3 hrs after the burst, respectively. On the first epoch no
significant radio emission was detected at the position of the optical
afterglow (GCN 3829), but on the second epoch a new radio source has
appeared with a flux density of 690+/- 41 microJy.

Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
