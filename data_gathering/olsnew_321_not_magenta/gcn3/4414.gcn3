FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"We re-observed the error circle of GRB 051227 with Gemini/GMOS starting
on 2005 Dec. 29.36 UT (38.6 hr after the burst) for a total of 25 min in
r-band.  Digital image subtraction performed on this image and the one
obtained on the previous night (13.9 hr after the burst; GCN 4410)
confirms that source S1 has faded, as indicated by Malesani et al. (GCN
4412) and D'Avanazo et al. (GCN 4413)."
