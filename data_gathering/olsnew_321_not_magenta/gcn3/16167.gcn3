J. Takahashi and A. Arai (Univ. of Hyogo)
report on behalf of the Nayuta team and the OISTER collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al., GCN 16142)
with Nishiharima Infrared Camera (NIC) attached to the Nayuta 2-m
telescope at the Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory.

The observations were conducted on 2014-04-23 at 10:05-10:29 UT and
13:03-13:53 UT.
We detected the near-infrared afterglow in H and Ks bands.

Photometric results of our observations are listed below.
We used 2MASS 13085994+4951082 as a reference star for photometry.

* 2MASS Ks error for the reference star is not given, and thus it is
not included in our error estimates for the GRB afterglow,
** Photometry was not possible.
