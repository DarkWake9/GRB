MASTER-OAFA  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in OAFA was pointed to the  GRB161001A 29 sec after notice 
time and 41 sec after trigger time at 2016-10-01 01:05:57UT. On our 
first (10s exposure)  set we  not found OT within 6 square degrees 
field around  SWIFT BAT  error-box (Page et al., GCN 19967; Markwardt et 
al.,GCN 19974 ) brighter then 16.7  unfiltered magnitude.

MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in SAAO was pointed to the  GRB161001A 167 sec after notice time 
and 176 sec after trigger time at 2016-10-01 01:08:17 UT. On our first 
(40s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box.

The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 18.4 mag

We found optical object at first hour coadded images  by both MASTERs 
telescopes at coordinates Ra 04:47:40.83 Dec -57:15:38.07 (+-0.7 arcsec 
error) with unfiltered magnitude:

0.8R +0.2B = 20.6 (+0.1 -0.4)

with respect to USNO B stars. We  have archival images in MASTER SAAO 
DataBase at 2016-04-09  with 20.9 3-SIGMA limit. We see same object at 
same position.

We note that our scale is 1 pix ~ 2 arcsec . So the DSS2 object  (Kruehler 
et al., GCN 19971)  and GROND afterglow candidate (Chen et al., GCN 19975) 
are inside the our pixel.
