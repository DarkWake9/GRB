Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160826A (trigger #709907)
(Mingo, et al., GCN Circ. 19866).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 183.120, -67.664 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  12h 12m 28.8s
    Dec(J2000) = -67d 39' 51.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, rough FRED-like peak starting
at T+0 sec, peaking at about T+5 sec and decaying to near background by T+20 
sec.  This is followed by low-level emission out to about T+70 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 52.6 +- 14.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+3.85 to T+61.58 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.54 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.9 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
