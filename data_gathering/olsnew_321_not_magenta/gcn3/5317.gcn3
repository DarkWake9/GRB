of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB060724 (Krimm et al., GCN5311) with Shajn 2.6m
telescope of CrAO. A set of 60 sec R-exposures was taken between July 14
(UT) 19:09 - 19: 40. At the position of the OT candidate (Krimm et al.,
GCN5311; Stefanescu GCN5314) we found an optical source. The source is
clearly visible on a combined image 28x60 sec. A photometry of the source
against USNO A2.0 is 19.9 +/-0.03. The photometry is preliminary.

The finding chart can be found in

We also detect the source in Maidanak 1.5m R-images (exposure 120 s) started
on July 14 (UT) 16:05 and do not detect OT on single B-images (exposure 120
s). A photometry of this observation is not available yet.
