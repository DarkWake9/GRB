A. Hajela, K. D. Alexander, R. Margutti (Northwestern), T. Laskar (U.
Bath), W. Fong (Northwestern), C. D. Kilpatrick (UCSC), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Swift GRB 200729A (Evans et al., GCN 28165) at a mean
frequency of 6 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning
2020 July 31 00:06:33.0 UT (1.19 days after the burst). We do not detect
radio emission down to a 3-sigma limit of ~23 microJy.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly approving our DDT and executing these
observations.
