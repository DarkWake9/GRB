A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

In addition to the BVRcIc calibration, we also acquired
some early time, short exposure Rc and Ic imagery for the
INTEGRAL burst GRB041219 (Gotz et al., GCN 2866)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope.  At the position of
the NIR afterglow (Blake and Bloom, GCN 2872), we
find no optical afterglow in the Ic bandpass at
t+13minutes, to a limit of Ic=19.7.
