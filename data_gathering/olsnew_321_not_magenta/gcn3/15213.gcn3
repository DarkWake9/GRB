SUBJECT: GRB 130912A: KAIT optical upper limit

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the short-duration GRB 130912A
(D'Elia et al., GCN 15212) starting at 08:48:04 UT, ~13 minutes after
the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in V, I, and clear filters (20 s exposure for each image). Due to
a technical issue, the first useful image begain ~35 minutes after the
burst. We do not detect any new source in the XRT error circle.
The estimated limiting magnitude in our first clear-band (close to R)
image is about 19.6 (calibrated to USNO B1.0) at a midtime of ~36
minutes after the burst.
