Stefano Valenti (UC Davis), Sheng Yang (INAF-OAPd, UC Davis), David Sand 
(UA), Leonardo Tartaglia (UA, UC Davis), Enrico Cappellaro(INAF-OAPd), 
Dan Reichart, Josh Haislip, Vladimir Kouprianov (UNC) report on behalf 
of the Gravitational Wave Follow-Up by DLT40.

We continued to monitor DLT17ck/SSS17a (GCN 21529;GCN21530; GCN21531), 
the electromagnetic counterpart candidate of the LIGO/Virgo GW G298048 
(GCN21509).
Following the optical observations reported for DLT17ck/SSS17a 
(GCN21579; GCN21531; GCN21567; GCN21541; GCN21590; GCN21553; GCN21560; 
GCN21584; GCN21580; GCN21583; GCN21590; GCN21595; GCN21597), here we 
report that DLT17ck/SSS17a is continuing fading.
Using data from the PROMPT 5 0.41m telescope located at CTIO, DLT40 
observation began at 2017 August 19.99 UT and shows the source at 
magnitude r = 18.96 Â± 0.10 mag. We also observed DLT17ck in i and z, for 
which analysis is under way.
