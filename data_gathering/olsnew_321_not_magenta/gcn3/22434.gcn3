V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L. Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC, Versoix) 
and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team 
report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:10:02  UT of February 22, 2018

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 256.5418 deg
DEC.= -36.8016  deg

with an uncertainty of  1.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 1 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 6e-7 
erg/cmq.

This burst was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cannizzo et al., GCN 
22433).

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
