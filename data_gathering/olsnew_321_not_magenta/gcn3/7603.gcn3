Santiago), R. Hudec (ASU-CAS Ondrejov), P. Perez-Gonzalez and J.
Zamorano (UCM Madrid) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The BOOTES-1 0.3m telescope in South Spain observed GRB 080413A,
starting at 02:55:20 UT (46 sec after receiving trigger, 1 minute after
GRB). A sequence of preprogrammed 6 sec, 20 and 60 sec exposures was
obtained. The optical counterpart reported by Rykoff at al. (GCN
7593) is clearly detected on the initial exposures.

Further data were obtained at the 2.5m NOTin La Palma under non-optimal
conditions.
