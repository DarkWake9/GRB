Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071001 (trigger #292826)
(De Pasquale, et al., GCN Circ. 6832).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 149.707, -59.763 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 58m 49.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 45' 48" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 85%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two main peaks: 1) starting/peaking/ending
at ~T-20/0/+30 sec, resp; 2) T+40/+48/+70; and a much weaker (~3 sigma) peak:
~T+70/+90/+100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 58.5 +- 1.0 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.6 to T+64.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.62 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.7 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+48.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
