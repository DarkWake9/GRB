The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 07:00:28 UT on 1 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200401A (trigger 607417233.807052 / 200401292).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 141.1, Dec = 17.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 24m, 17d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 29.0 degrees.
