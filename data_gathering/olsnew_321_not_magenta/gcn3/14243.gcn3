"At 18:35:51.73 UT on 19 February 2013, the Fermi Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 130219A (trigger 
382991754 / 130219.775).  The on-ground calculated location, 
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 303.7, DEC = +40.8  
(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 14m, +40d 49'), with a 
statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is currently 
estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
is 85 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two distinct peaks with a total duration 
(T90) of about 96 s (50-300 keV). The spectrum is taken over the 
peaks, from T0+0.003 to T0+3.328 s and T+66.817 to T0+101.634, 
and is well fit by a Comptonized model with Ep = 396.0 +/- 21.0 and
alpha = -1.11 +/- 0.02.  This yields a fluence (10-1000 keV) in this
time interval of ï»¿(3.18 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2.

This interval is equally well fit to a Band function with
Ep = 343.1 +/- 25.5, alpha = -1.08 +/- 0.02, and
beta = -2.28 +/- 0.15.  This yields a fluence (10 - 1000 keV) over this
interval of (3.11 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
