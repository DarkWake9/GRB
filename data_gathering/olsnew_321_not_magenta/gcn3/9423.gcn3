J. Hjorth (DARK/NBI) report:

We observed the field of GRB 090518 (GCN 9386, Evans et al.) with
ALFOSC/NOT on La Palma starting May 18, 20:54 UT (21 h after the burst).
Observations were obtained in R (3x300s), I (3x300s) and z (6x200s)
filters at high airmass.

We do not detect any new source at the XRT position (GCN 9387, Evans et
al.) in the summed image of each filter. The following upper limits were
obtained (based on USNO B1.0 reference stars and a NOT z-band archival
zeropoint):

R > 23.7 mag
I > 21.8 mag
z(AB) > 22.5 mag
