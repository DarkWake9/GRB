report:

We observed error radius of XRT position of GRB060602B (Swift trigger
213190, Schady et al. GCN5200) with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope
(RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey), starting at
June 3, 00:19UT, i.e. ~25 min after the burst. A series of frames was
taken (7*30s and 5*300 exposures in Rc).

Down to our limiting magnitude R=~23, inside of XRT error circle we
found the only object (RA=17:49:31.80, DEC=-28:08:02.2). The object is
relatively bright (R=18.7) and starlike (PSF FWHM=~1.4''). It is present
in DSS and its brightness did not change during our observations,
therefore we do not consider this object as optical counterpart of
GRB060602B.
