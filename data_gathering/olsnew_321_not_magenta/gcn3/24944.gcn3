WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 190630C (Ukwatta et al.,
GCN 24927) starting at ~0.379 days after the burst. Observations
were performed in the clear (roughly R) filters, a total of 31
images were obtained and the exposure time was 60 s per image.
We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within the Enhanced
XRT position error circle (Goad et al., GCN 24930), neither in single
image, nor in the co-add images. We estimate our limiting magnitude
of our co-added image is ~19.0 mag calibrated to the APASS catalog.
