report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-07-06T17:03:05.40 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190706D (trigger ID: HEB190706710) in a routine search of the dataï¼Œ
which was also triggered by INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (trigger #8326) 
and Konus-Wind (GCN #25047).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a single  
pulse with a duration (T90) of 0.28 s measured from T0-0.10 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0-0.07 s, is 2551 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 633 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
