TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4553
SUBJECT: GRB 060121: A short-hard GRB in a cluster?

E. O. Ofek (Caltech) report:

The position of the short-hard burst GRB060121 (Arimoto et al. GCN 4550;
Prigozhin et al. GCN 4551) is located 10.3 arcmin from the center of
the galaxy cluster ZwCl 0906.7+4603.

Note, that the probability to find a galaxy cluster
in the NED archive, within 10 arcmin from a random position
on the celestial sphere (with Galactic latitude |b|>25 deg),
is about 5%.
A graph of this probability as function of angular distance is
available from:
