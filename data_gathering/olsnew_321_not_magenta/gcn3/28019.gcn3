report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:18:00.64 UT on 23 June 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200623A (trigger 614575085 / 200623138)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (DeLaunay et al., GCN 28013).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 36
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-64 ms to T0 is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.09 +/- 0.09.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.2 +/- 0.6)E-7 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-64 ms in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.7 +/- 1.0 ph/s/cm^2.

A power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 353 +/- 131 keV, alpha = -0.07 +/- 0.53.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
