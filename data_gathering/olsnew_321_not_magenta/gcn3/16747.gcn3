V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on  behalf of larger GRB 
follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 140824A (Beardmore  et al., GCN 
16732) with ZTSh telescope of CrAO observatory starting on Aug. 24 (UT) 
17:48:55 (9.1 hours after burst trigger). We took several images in 
R-filter of 120 s exposure. Within  enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., 
GCN  16735) we do  not detect any source. Photometry of a combined image 
is following

Date        UT start,  t-t0     Filter   Exp.   OT      UL (3 sigma)
                       (mid, days)        (s)

2014-08-24 17:48:55    0.4105   R        39x120 n/d     23.5

The photometry is based on USNO-B1.0  star
1233-0239576 (13:46:31.55 +33:18:14.7) assuming R=19.66
