The short-duration GRB 190510A
(IPN triangulation: Kozlova et al., GCN 24497)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=37156.266 s UT (10:19:16.266).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
which started at T0-0.2 s and had a total duration of ~ 0.6 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.36(-0.29,+0.38)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.044 s,
of 8.58(-2.57,+2.72)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the bulk of the burst emission was detected before
the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.220 s to T0+0.342 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = 0.5 (-0.54,+1.01), and Ep = 574 (-93,+105) keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 68% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
