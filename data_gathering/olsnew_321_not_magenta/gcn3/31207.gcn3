The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:48:42 UT on 11 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211211B (trigger 660952127.842124 / 211211909).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 228.1, Dec = 48.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 12m, 48d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 128.0 degrees.
