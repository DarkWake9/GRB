We report observations of two possible counterparts to the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave trigger S190425z (GCN 24168), under the the advanced Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (ePESSTO+; see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40 http://www.pessto.org). The observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla with the EFOSC2 instrument.

ZTF19aarzaod/AT2019dzw was announced by Kasliwal et al. (GCN 24191) as a promising candidate from a ZTF search of the field. Follow-up spectroscopy by Buckley et al. (GCN 24205), Izzo et al. (GCN 24208) and Wiersema et al. (GCN 24209) indicated the transient is a young Type II supernova. Our NTT spectrum shows a broad feature consistent with H-alpha at the redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.028).

ATLAS19hwn/AT2019ebm was announced by McBrien et al. (GCN 24197) as a marginal candidate identified during targeted imaging of the localisation region by ATLAS. Follow up observations by Perley et al. (GCN 24202) did not recover the reported source to a limit of r>22.0 mag. We obtained deep imaging to look for a rapidly fading transient. A 5x200s observation in r band shows no source at this position, with preliminary analysis indicating a limit of r>23 mag.
