The INTEGRAL satellite requires continuous contact between the 
spacecraft and a ground station
for operations and data down-link.
Unfortunately, at the time
of the LIGO/Virgo trigger G296853 (2017-08-09 08:28:21.747 UTC),
there was a scheduled ground-station outage. Therefore, no INTEGRAL data are
available on 2017-08-09 between 06:40:13 and 12:24:39 UTC, preventing 
any investigation of the presence of an electromagnetic signal 
temporally coincident with this gravitational wave trigger.


The field of view of the imaging instruments has not covered the 
high-probability region
of the LIGO event at any time after the trigger and it will not in the 
coming days.
As a consequence, no search of a possible GRB afterglow-like signal is 
foreseeable.
