D. Xu, D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), S. Barros (Queen Univ., Belfast), P. 
Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the field of GRB 090926B (Grupe et al., GCN 9935) with the 
NOT equipped with ALFOSC. Observations were carried out in the R and I 
bands, at high airmass (~2.5), starting on 2009 Sep 27.122 UT (4.99 hr 
after the GRB) and 27.146 UT (5.58 hr after the GRB), respectively.

No source is visible inside the enhanced X-ray error circle (Grupe et 
al., GCN 9940; http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions), down to a limiting 
magnitude R ~ 23 based on USNO-B1 stars in the field.
