report:

"We have observed the  field of GRB 050724 (GCN Circ. 3665) in the  
J-band with the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope (mean observing epoch July  
25.86 UT, Texp=45 min). A comparison with the images  taken yesterday 
with the same telescope (mean observing epoch July 24.87 UT, Texp=15  
min) did not reveal any variable source in the reported XRT error  
boxes (GCN Circ. 3678, 3665, 3669) down to J~20. At first epoch we 
note the presence of a possible object on our detection limit (J~20.5) 
located at RA(J2000)=16:24:45.02, DEC(J2000)=-27:32:29.1. However, the 
worse seeing on July 25.86 UT prevented us from confirming its 
potential variability."
