K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

D.Gotz (IASF-Milano), P.Favre (ISDC), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano),
J.Borkowski (ISDC), and the INTEGRAL Science Working team,
report:

This burst (GCN 1766, 1767, 1768) was also observed by Ulysses. 

Although the INTEGRAL timing is still undergoing refinement, we have
triangulated it assuming a systematic uncertainty of 100 ms, which is
supported by recent SGR observations.  The preliminary annulus is
centered  at RA, Decl(2000)= 182.935, 36.337 degrees, with radius
78.549 +/-  0.023 degrees (3 sigma ).  This annulus intersects the
INTEGRAL error circle given in GCN 1768 at two points:

          RA                               DEC
     282.557459=18 H 50 M 13.79 S      31.832096= 31 o 49' 55"
     282.642596=18 H 50 M 34.22 S      31.932013= 31 o 55' 55"

This reduces the error box size to about 15 square arcminutes.
This annulus may be improved.  A map has been posted at
