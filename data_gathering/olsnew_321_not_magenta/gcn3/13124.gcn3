Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120327A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 518731) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 32.40min after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
21 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good. Observations cannot begin earlier because
of the presence of the ESO 3.6 meter telescope that
hid the field of view!

We detect a new fading source in the error box given by SWIFT
We detected the candidate couterpart mentioned by Sbarufatti
et al. (GCNC 13123).

OT is still at R=17.5 at 45 min after GRB.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
