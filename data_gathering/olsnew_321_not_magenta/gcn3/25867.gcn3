MASTER OT J020953.61+360533.8 discovery

During inspect, MASTER-Kislovodsk auto-detection system discovered OT source at
(RA, Dec) = 02h 09m 53.61s +36d 05m 33.8s on 2019-09-29.86025UT.

The OT unfiltered magnitude is 18.4m (mlimit 19.9m).
The OT is seen in 2 images. There is no minor planet at this place.

We have reference images without OT on 2014-10-28.91229 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 20.6m, nearest in time on 2019-06-19 23:25:49 with mlim=18.2 (MASTER-Kislovodsk).

Our preliminary classification is CV, but 
Spectral observations are required.
