Guziy (Univ. of Nikolaev) and D. R. Xiong, Y. F. Fan, J. M. Bai, C. J. Wang, Y. X. Xin, X. H. Zhao (Yunnan Observatories of CAS) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 210209A by Swift (Laha et al. GCNC 29442), the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang Astronomical Observatory (China) started to gather images after the twilight as soon as it was possible. No new source is detected within the Swift/XRT enhanced position (Evans et al. GCNC 29443) down to 19.8 mag in the co-added images (15x60 s, clear filer) starting at 12:13 UT on Feb 10. The non-detection is consistent with the limits reported by both Swift/UVOT (Breeveld et al. GCNC 29453) and MITSuME (Hosokawa et al. GCNC 29455).

We thank the staff at Lijiang observatory for their excellent support.
