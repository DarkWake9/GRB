TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  19313
SUBJECT: GRB 160411A - Gemini-S afterglow candidate

FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <A.J.Levan@warwick.ac.uk>

A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), W. Fong (Arizona) and N.R. Tanvir (Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

“We obtained a second epoch of i-band observations of the short-GRB 160411A (Page et al. GCN 19279) on 2016 April 13, 10:01 UT. Photometry suggests that our previously identified source B (Levan & Fong GCN 19293) has faded by approximately 0.9 magnitudes between the two epochs obtained 48 hours apart, although a source close to this location is still faintly detected in our imaging. We therefore suggest this source may be the optical afterglow of GRB 160411A.

We thank the Gemini staff, in particular Bryan Miller and Rodolfo Angeloni for assistance with these observations.”
