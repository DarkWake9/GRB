Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210217A (trigger #1033264)
(Simpson et al., GCN Circ. 29521).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 97.578, 68.715 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 30m 18.6s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 42' 55.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 30%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked FRED-like structure
that starts and peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is
4.22 +- 1.15 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.65 to T+4.89 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.01 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.8 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T-0.13 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 5.1 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
