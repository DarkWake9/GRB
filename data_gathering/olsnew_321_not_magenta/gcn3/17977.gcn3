Paul Kuin (MSSL-UCL), Marissa McCauley (PSU) and Daniele Malesani 
(DARK/NBI) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of the Fermi GRB 
150627A 33622 s after the LAT trigger (Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 17971; 
Yu et al., GCN Circ. 17975).

An optical object consistent with the XRT position (Gompertz et al., GCN 
Circ. 17976) is detected at RA, Dec = 117.47108, -51.489417 deg (J2000), 
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  07:49:53.06
Dec(J2000): -51:29:21.9

with an uncertainty of 1".

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et 
al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the initial exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic 
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.32 in the direction of the 
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).

While no optical variability can be securely inferred from the UVOT 
photometry, the source is not visible in the DSS survey, and brighter 
than its limit, which suggests it to be the optical afterglow of GRB 
150627A.
