J. A. Kennea (PSU) and J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the 
Swift/XRT Team:

Swift/XRT began observing the position of GRB 140903A at 15:01:29UT, 
approximately 59 seconds after the BAT trigger (GCN #16763). In 
preliminary data we find an uncatalogued fading source at the following 
location: RA/Dec(J2000) = 238.01597, 27.603287, which is equivalent to:

RA(J2000) = 15h 52m 3.83s,
Dec(J2000) = 27d 36m 11.8s,

with an estimated uncertainty of 10 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). 
The light-curve appears to show rapid fading, consistent with this X-ray 
source being a GRB afterglow. We will publish an improved position for 
this burst when more data become available.
