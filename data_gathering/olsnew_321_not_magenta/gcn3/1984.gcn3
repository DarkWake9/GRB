TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1984
SUBJECT: GRB 030328: OT photometry
DATE:    03/03/29 12:34:20 GMT
FROM:    Avishay Gal-Yam at Tel Aviv U, Israel  <avishay@wise1.tau.ac.il>

A. Gal-Yam, E. O. Ofek and D. Polishook (Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the OT (Peterson & Price 2003, GCN 1974) 
of GRB 030328 (Villasenor et al. 2003, GCN 1978) using the Wise observatory 1m 
telescope + SITe CCD camera, starting March 28, 21:48 UT (10 hours after
the burst). B, V and R-band frames (300 s each) were obtained under fair 
to moderate conditions, but incoming clouds prevented further observations.

We detect the OT on the R-band image, at magnitude about 20.5, roughly
consistent with the predictions of Price (GCN 1977) and the observations
of Fugazza et al. (GCN 1982). Further analysis is underway, and B and 
V-band upper limits will be derived once the field is calibrated.
