Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190424A (trigger #900285)
(Group, et al., GCN Circ. 24163).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 48.693, 20.239 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 14m 46.2s
   Dec(J2000) = +20d 14' 19.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 41%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, fairly symmetrical pulse
starting
at T-2 seconds, peaking at T+2 sec, and declining to background by T+12 sec.
The spacecraft slewed away from the burst location at T+80 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.6 +- 2.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.31 to T+12.04 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.45 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
