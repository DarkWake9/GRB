The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

Parameter estimation to determine the probability of a remnant is ongoing.
Preliminary human vetting of this candidate indicates a chirp structure in
the L1 time-frequency plane with no indication of contamination by
instrumental artifacts.  We will send another Circular within 24 hours with
any updated information that is available.
