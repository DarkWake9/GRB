U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130504A detected 
by SWIFT(trigger 555096) with the robotic 
telescopes of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy.

The observations started automatically 2 min 42 sec after the 
GRB trigger, with our schmidt telescope D=400 mm F/D=3 
and our Newton telescope D=250mm F/D=5.5.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added 2 series of 10 unfiltered CCD exposures of 120s each.

We did not found any optical counterpart in the error box of 
the XRTcandidate (Cummings et al. GCN 14551) and in error box of
X-ray afterglow candidate (P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB)
et al. GCN 14553) at our following limiting magnitude:
