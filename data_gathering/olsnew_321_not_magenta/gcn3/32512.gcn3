The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:56:35.37 UT on 31 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220831C (trigger 683654200 / 220831664).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 337.0, Dec = -47.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 28m, -47d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
