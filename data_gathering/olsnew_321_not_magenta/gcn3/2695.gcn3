D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), N. Produit and N. Mowlavi (ISDC)
report:

The analysis of INTEGRAL data reveal no presistent source at the position
of 040903 (Gotz et al., GCN 2690) with a 3 sigma upper limit of 10 mCrab.

Due to its soft spectrum, we conclude that the burst is either an X-Ray
Flash or, due to its location in the Galactic Bulge region, a hard and
powerful type I X-ray burst from a new transient source.
