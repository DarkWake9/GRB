collaboration:

We observed the field of the MAXI/GSC GRB 150518A (Kawamuro, et al., GCN 
17825) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting on 
May, 20 (UT) 16:50:47. We obtained several images in R-filter of 120 s 
exposure. The optical afterglow candidate (Xu et al., GCN 17829)  which 
coincides with SDSS J153648.25+161946.9 galaxy is clearly detected. 
Photometry of the galaxy is following
