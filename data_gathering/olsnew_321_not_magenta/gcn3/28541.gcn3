Swift observed the field of IceCube 200929A (GCN Circ. 28532) between 22:37:07
2020 September 29 and 00:11:03 on 2020 September 30, collecting a total of 1.4 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 3-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.2 degrees.

We found 1 X-ray source, as detailed below, which is a known X-ray source,
consistent with catalogued fluxes. We therefore do not claim it as the likely
counterpart to IceCube 200929A

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 9-10 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected source was:

Source no:   1
RA (J2000):  28.84047 [degrees] = 01h 55m 21.71s
Dec (J2000): +2.9565 [degrees] = +02d 57' 23.4"
Error:       +5.0 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 0.014 (+0.008, -0.006) ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       5.8 (+3.5, -2.5) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1
