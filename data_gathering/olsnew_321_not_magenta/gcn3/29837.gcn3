The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:09:29 UT on 20 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210420A (trigger 640588174.204176 / 210420215).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 253.4, Dec = 12.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 53m, 12d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 21.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 80.0 degrees.
