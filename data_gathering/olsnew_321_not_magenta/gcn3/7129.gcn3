MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to 
GRB 071122.1 (GRB_TIME is 2007-11-22 01:23:25.62, M. Stamatikos et al., 
GCN Circ N 7121).
The first image was at 2007-11-22 01:25:57 UT, 69 s after the GCN notice 
time and  151 s  after the GRB time.
These observations were affected by proximity to the full moon.
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
The robot not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  15.6 (s/n=10).

Individual images have limiting magnitudes about 16.
We set  the following specific limits for S. B. Cenko (GCN Circ 7125) 
OT position.

The reduction is continuing.

The delay of the given telegram is connected with participation and
successful end of national Russia football teem on a selection cycle
EURO' 08. Our collective is especially grateful to national Croatia-teem
for the help during the difficult moment!

The reduction is continuing.
