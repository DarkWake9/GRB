The Gravitationally-lensed Gravitational Wave Hunters collaboration 
report observations of strong-lensing galaxy clusters located within the 
sky localisation of the LIGO/Virgo trigger G297595 (LVC GCN Circ. 21474).

Following Smith et al. (arXiv:1707.03412) we searched the initial 
(August 14th) and updated (August 16th) skymaps for strong-lensing 
galaxy clusters that lie within the 90% credible sky localisation.

Abell 3084 was the closest strong-lensing galaxy cluster to the peak 
probability in the initial skymap.  We observed this cluster through the 
i-band filter with GMOS on Gemini-South on the nights of August 14, 16, 
17, 20, 21, and with MUSE on VLT on the nights of August 16, and 18. 
GMOS spans a 5.5x5.5 arcminute field of view, and MUSE spans a 1x1 
arcminute field of view with a wavelength range of 4650-9300 Angstroms.

SMACSJ0304.3-4401 was the closest strong-lensing galaxy cluster to the 
peak probability in the updated skymap.  We observed this cluster 
through the i-band filter with GMOS on Gemini-South on the nights of 
August 17 and 20.

Analysis of these data is ongoing.  Colleagues with complementary data 
are welcome to contact us with a view to collaboration.

We thank the staff at ESO and Gemini for their outstanding support of 
our observing programmes.
