Using the data set from T-240 to T+723 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130514A (trigger #555821)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 14632).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 296.278, -7.974 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 45m 06.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 58' 26.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 60%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks, the first starting at ~T-20 sec,
peaking at ~T+12 sec, and returning almost to baseline at ~T+80 sec.
The second peak starts at ~T+80 sec, peaks at ~T+115 sec, and ends at ~T+380 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 204 +- 13 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.09 to T+258.01 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.80 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+13.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
