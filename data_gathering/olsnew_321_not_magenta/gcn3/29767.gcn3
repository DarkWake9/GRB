S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 60 s has been detected by IBAS in the
 IBIS/ISGRI data at 17:11:22  UT of April 6, 2021.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  132.4589 deg
DEC.=  +76.5322  deg
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

Due to telemetry saturation, we can derive only lower limits on the fluence
and peak flux (20-200 keV).
These are  >1.2e-6 erg/cm2 and >1.6  ph/cm2/s (1-s integration  time),
 respectively.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
