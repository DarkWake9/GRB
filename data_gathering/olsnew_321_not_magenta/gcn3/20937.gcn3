On 2017-03-21 07:32:20.69 the IceCube detector has observed a
high-energy neutrino likely of astrophysical origin, IceCube-170321A
(GCN 20929). The location of the event is contained in a circle of
1.2 degree radius (90% confidence) centered at RA=98.30 Dec=-15.02..

INTEGRAL has performed a Target-of-Opportunity observation of the
neutrino localization region, starting 31.5 hours after the neutrino
detection from 2017-03-22 15:10:29 UTC to 2017-03-23 04:30:20 UTC,
corresponding to a total on-target time of 45 ks. IBIS was online for
a fraction of this time, 39.5ks.

We have investigated the data collected by INTEGRAL IBIS and JEM-X
without finding any significant new source in the JEM-X data between 3
and 35 keV within the localization area of IceCube-170321A. In the
IBIS/ISGRI 25-80 keV mosaic image, corresponding to the whole
observation period, we identify an excess with a SNR of 3.9. The
probability of this excess happening randomly in the region of
interest is 3%.

We derived an upper limit on the flux of any new source in the 90%
localization region of IceCube-170321A, averaged over the observation,
of 4 mCrab (1.2x10-10 erg/cm2/s) in 3-35 keV, 3.7 mCrab (3.7x10-11
erg/cm2/s) in 25-80 keV , and 7 mCrab (1.0x10-10 erg/cm2/s) in 80-200
keV.

We have also searched for new sources in the whole area covered by the
observation with sensitivity not substantially worse than the deepest
target sensitivity: 16 degree diameter for JEM-X (3-35 keV) and 30
degrees for ISGRI (20-200 keV). We did not find any unidentified
source with a SNR larger than 5.

INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS observations at the time of the neutrino detection is
reported in GCN 20928.

We thank the INTEGRAL Science Operations Centre (ESA/ESAC, Madrid,
Spain) and the Mission Operations Centre (ESA/ESOC, Darmstadt,
Germany) for their prompt scheduling of these observations.
