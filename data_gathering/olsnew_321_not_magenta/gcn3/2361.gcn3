J. Wren and W.T. Vestrand report on behalf of the RAPTOR team;

Both telescope arrays of our RAPTOR stereoscopic sky monitoring system
responded to the first HETE-2 ground notice for GRB030823 (2818).  The
first image was taken at 11:10:24.74 UT -- 4 seconds after receipt of
the GCN notice and 2.3 hours after the burst itself.  The initial
images from RAPTOR-A reached an unfiltered limiting magnitude of 16.0.
Comparison against our own archival frames and the USNO-A2.0 catalog
within 10 arcminutes of the coordinates given in the second HETE
ground notice (HETE 2818 seq. 4) yielded no candidate objects.
