M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU), R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) and
T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Around 04:58 UT on 2009-07-26, Swift lost star tracker lock,
leading to misidentification of the Crab as a gamma-ray burst. 

Recovery operations are proceeding.  However, there may be
further spurious triggers from this cause in the coming minutes.
