V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), V.Biryukov(SAI) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have obtained 44 unfiltered exposures (120-s each) of the GRB 030228
error box (HETE Trigger #2650). The images were taken with the AT-64
telescope of  Crimean Astrophysical observatory and cover the period 
(UT) 18:46 - 23:07  March 28, 2003.  We used CCD SBIG ST-8 with 
maximum of sensitivity in the red spectral band.

 In a co-added image the OT is visible at the position of reported by B.A.
Peterson and P.A. Price (GCN 1974).  The brightness was estimated in 
respect to the star B (GCN 1982) as R = 20.9 +/- 0.2.

     Start time       exposure          OT
March 28 18:46  44x120 s     20.9 +- 0.2

Detailed calibration is underway.
