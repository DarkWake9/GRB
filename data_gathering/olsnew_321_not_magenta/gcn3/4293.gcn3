SUBJECT: GRB 051117B: MARGE Optical Limits
DATE:    05/11/18 23:56:16 GMT
FROM:    Heather Swan at U.of Michigan/ROTSE  <hflewell@umich.edu>

H. Swan (U Mich), W. Rujopakarn (U Mich), and I. Smith (Rice) report  
on behalf of the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS telescope, located at the  
Maui Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, responded to GRB051117B  
(Swift trigger 164279).  Images with a low resolution diffraction  
grating were taken between 13:40 and 13:54 UT, under scattered cloud  
conditions.  The first image was taken 14 minutes after the GCN  
notice time, and the exposure time was 10 seconds for each image.  A  
preliminary analysis gives a limiting magnitude of 19.4 at 13:48 UT.
