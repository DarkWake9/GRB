S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

We have imaged the full error circle of GRB050209 (HETE 11568, GCN 3013)
with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations commenced
approximately 6 minutes after receiving the HETE trigger.  We have
obtained two epochs of coverage in the Kron R filter at median epochs of
approximately 4:15 UT (2.7 hours after the burst) and 6:00 UT (4.5 hours
after the burst).

In the first epoch, we find no new source by comparison with the Digitized
Sky Survey to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 20.5 (magnitudes calculated
with reference to the Guide Star Catalog).  Visual comparison between
our two epoch shows no sign of any fading sources in the field.

We also note the presence of a minor planet, 1998 WB7, about to enter the
HETE error circle at the time of our second epoch.

Further observations are planned.
