We observed the JCMT source (GCN 30882) using SMA.
The SMA 230GHz observation was started at 2021 Sep 27, 15:21 (UT).
The JCMT source was clearly identified at
04h02m05.304s -04d24m28.14s (0.5‚Äù) with ~17 mJy/beam.

The position is consistent with the cataloged IR source (WISEA
J040205.29-042428.5).  The radio source, NVSS J040205-042434 is also
counterpart when we consider the margin of position error.

Further detailed multi-wavelength investigations are encouraged.

We would like to thank SMA staff.
