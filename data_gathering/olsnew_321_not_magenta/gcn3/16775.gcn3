Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:17:22.79 UT on 01 September 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140901B (trigger 431245045 / 140901262), which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cummings 2014, GCN 16773)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 34 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 65 +/- 14 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0 s to T0+65 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.2 +/- 0.2  and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 219 +/- 82 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.8 +/- 0.6)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.6 +/- 0.2  ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
