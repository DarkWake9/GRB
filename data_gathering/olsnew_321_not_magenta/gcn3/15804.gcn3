The long-duration intense GRB 140206B
(Fermi-GBM detection: von Kienlin, GCN 15790;
Fermi-LAT detection: Bissaldi et al., GCN 15791)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=23769.061 s UT (06:36:09.061).

The light curve consists of two major multi-peaked emission
episodes in the time interval from ~T0-3 s to ~T0+155 s.
The emission is seen up to ~12 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140206_T23769/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (1.52 ± 0.09)x10-4 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+7.488 s,
of (1.73 ± 0.09)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+154.368 s)
is best fit in the 25 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.07 ± 0.08,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.28 ± 0.09,
the peak energy Ep = 227 ± 18 keV,
chi2 = 93.8/96 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+8.448 s to T0+16.384 s)
is best fit in the 35 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.59 ± 0.08,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.18 ± 0.04,
the peak energy Ep = 278 ± 16 keV,
chi2 = 84.3/93 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
