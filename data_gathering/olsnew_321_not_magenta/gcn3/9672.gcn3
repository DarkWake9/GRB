Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090715B (trigger #357512)
(Vetere, et al., GCN Circ. 9668).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 251.337, 44.837 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 45m 20.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 50' 12.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a series of peaks.  The first starts
at ~T-10 sec, peaks at ~T+7 sec, and returns almost to background at T+35 sec.
The second peak start at ~T+45 sec and ends at ~T+100 sec.  The third peak
starts at ~T+230 sec and ends at ~T+290 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 266 +- 11 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.6 to T+292.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
