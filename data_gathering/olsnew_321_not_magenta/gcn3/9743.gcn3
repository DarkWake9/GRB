report:


The long GRB 090727B triggered Konus-Wind at T0=84749.412 s UT
(23:32:29.412). The burst had a smooth temporal structure with
a duration of ~25 s. The Konus-Wind light curves are available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB090727_T84749/

This GRB was observed by Odyssey (HEND and GRS) and MESSENGER (GRNS).
Wind-Odyssey-MESSENGER triangulation, together with Konus-Wind
ecliptic latitude constrains, lead to the following preliminary,
3 sigma error box, which area is 1.00 sq. deg.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of (1.15 ± 0.15)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+14.336 s,
of (8.5 ± 3.2)x10-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+24.832 s) is well fit, in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range,
by GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.18(-0.27,+0.34),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.97( < -2.50),
the peak energy Ep = 152(-16, +17) keV (chi2 = 54/57 dof).

All the quoted values are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
