The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:42:37 UT on 4 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190604A (trigger 581337762.053602 / 190604446).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 342.5, Dec = 46.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 49m, 46d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
