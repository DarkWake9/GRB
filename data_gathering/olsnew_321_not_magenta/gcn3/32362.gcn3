The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:41:07 UT on 11 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220711A (trigger 679214472.628158 / 220711279).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 96.1, Dec = 33.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 24m, 33d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 50.0 degrees.
