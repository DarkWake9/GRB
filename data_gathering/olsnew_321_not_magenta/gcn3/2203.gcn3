GRB 030329: all-sky CCD images by K. Shiokawa immediately after the burst

T. Ishida (Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory), T. Kato (Kyoto U)
and K. Shiokawa (Nagoya U) report:

   K. Shiokawa (Nagoya U) is taking all-sky CCD images at 572.5nm for
monitoring night sky light.  As a preliminary inspection, we have examined
four images immediately after the GRB 030329 burst time,
whose exposures started at 11:27, 11:57, 12:27 and 12:57 UT, respectively.
All images are taken every 30 minutes with 105 seconds exposure.

No obvious optical afterglow was detected on these images.  
A quick look of each image has yielded an upper limit of about 6.4 mag.  

Observation system used are described in 
Shiokawa, K. et al. 1999, Earth, Planets, and Space, 51, 887-896, and
Shiokawa, K. et al. 2000, Adv. Space Res., 26, 1025-1028.

Further analysis of the images is in progress.
