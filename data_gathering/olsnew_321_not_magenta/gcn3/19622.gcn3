Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160629A detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 7498) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 21s after the GRB trigger
(19s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
39 degrees above horizon and weather conditions were good.

We detect a new fading source in the error box given by INTEGRAL
(Gotz et al. GCNC 19621) at the following position (+/- 2 arcsec):

  RA(J2000.0) = 00:19:27.42
DEC(J2000.0) = +76:58:00.7

t1(s) t2(s)  Rmag  Site
   98   128   16.4  TAROT Calern
  139   168   16.9  TAROT Calern
  407   497   17.1  TAROT Calern

The first image (t1=21s t2=81s) is trailed with a
duration of 60.0s (see the description in Klotz et al.,
2006, A&A 451, L39). It shows an increase of the
optical flux until R~16.4 at 81s. This image must
be analyzed more carefuly.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=121.0706 lat=+14.2321
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 1.2 magnitude
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
