We observed  optical afterglow of GRB060512  (Cummings et al. GCN 5117;
Klotz et al. GCN 5140)  in Nordic Optical Telescope with NOTcam in near IR
(J) on May 13 between (UT) 02.40 - 03:44.  A  brightness of the OT is
following:

J mag, Err,Exposure,  T0+ (Mid time,s)

18.90 0.09  8x90s  12838
18.96 0.09  8x90s  13849
19.09 0.10  8x90s  14843
19.14 0.11  8x90s  15835

The calibration is based on 2MASS star RA  = 13:02:57.846 DEC =
+41:10:23.08, J = 14.485 +/-0.03 and consistent with calibration based on IR
standard star observation in the same night.  A power law decay index alpha
~ 1.1 in J between   (UT) 02.40 - 03:44 (May ,13) is compatible with the
index deduced from  Ks observations (Hearty et al. GCN 5126, Tanaka et al.
GCN 5129).
