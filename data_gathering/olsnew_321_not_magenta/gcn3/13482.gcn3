N. P. M. Kuin (MSSL-UCL) and C. J. Saxton (UCL-MSSL)  report
on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 120714A
3259 s after the BAT trigger (Saxton et al., GCN Circ. 13464).

No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position (Beardmore etal.,
GCN Circ. No. 13470) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.

Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag

white_FC          3259         3409          147         >19.9
white             3259        28944         2696         >21.8

b                 4237        28344         2135         >21.1

w1                3826        23171         1058         >21.0
m2                3621        22489         1279         >21.0
w2                4648        17394         1667         >21.5

A possible source was marginally present in the u band during the first two
images, but not seen later, nor in any of the other bands.

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
