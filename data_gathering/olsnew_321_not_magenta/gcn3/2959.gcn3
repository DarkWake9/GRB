on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 20:03:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050117b.

The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 243.380,-70.358 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 10 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a large systematic
uncertainty).  This is 44 deg off the BAT boresight.  This burst occurred
with a steeply decreasing background event rate while Swift was exiting the SAA.
This weak burst is at the BAT detection threshold.  The duration is ~2 sec.
