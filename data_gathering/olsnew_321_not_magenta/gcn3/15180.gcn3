R.L.C. Starling (U. Leicester), F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), M.M. Chester (PSU), and M. De Pasquale (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift began a target of opportunity observation (target ID 20296) of INTEGRAL Weak Alert #6931/0 on September 4, 2013 at 18:37 UT, approximately 2 hours after the possible burst was detected by INTEGRAL. Its INTEGRAL coordinates are RA = 256.876 deg, Dec = -32.011 deg, with an error of 3.6 arcminutes (see http://www.ncac.torun.pl/~jubork/ibas/ibas?onlyyear=2013&onlymonth=9&slcn=weak).

The XRT began observing the field at 18:39:03.9 UT, 7.2 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger. No source was detected in 2.3 ks of promptly downlinked SPER data. We are waiting for the full 6 ks dataset to detect any source.

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter starting 7170 seconds after the INTEGRAL trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. Because of the density of catalogued stars, further analysis is required to report an upper limit for any new source.
