TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1043
SUBJECT: IPN Triangulation of the Giant Flare from SGR1900+14

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and E. Montanari, C. Guidorzi,
F. Frontera, and M. Feroci, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses observed the giant flare reported in GCN 1041.  As observed by
Ulysses, this flare had a duration ~40 s, a 25-100 keV fluence ~2.6 x
10^-4 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s ~1.7x10^-5 erg/cm^2 s (or
about 25 and 200 times less fluence and peak flux than the giant flare
of 1998 August 27).  As Ulysses was in a solar proton flux, these
numbers are subject to more than the usual uncertainties.
Triangulation confirms that this flare is indeed from SGR1900+14 as
reported in GCN 1041.  The time history of this flare is quite unusual,
and will be posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/ newdata.html/010418.
