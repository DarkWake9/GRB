report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:50:10.89 UT on 21 June 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140621A (trigger 425073013/140621827, IPN
triangulation: Golenetskii at al., GCN 16444), which was also detected
by Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN 16445), and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight, using the GBM on-ground calculated
location, is 97 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two prominent peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 6.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+6.14 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 298 +/- 24 keV,
alpha = -0.3 +/- 0.1, and beta = -2.3 +/- 0.2

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.13 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1 second peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.128 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
