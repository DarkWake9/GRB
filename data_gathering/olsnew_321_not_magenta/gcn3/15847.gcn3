Using the data set from T-240 to T+824 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140215A (trigger #586680)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 15837).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 104.129, 41.787 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 56m 31.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 47' 12.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 15%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting 
at ~T-15 sec, peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+180 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 84.2 +- 53.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.47 to T+181.76 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.19 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.9 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
