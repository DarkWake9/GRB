The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 12:49:49.29 UT on 29 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200629A (trigger 615127794 / 200629535). The
on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA =
338.46, Dec = -65.59 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 34m, -65d
35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees. On-ground localization
was delayed by a network outage.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
