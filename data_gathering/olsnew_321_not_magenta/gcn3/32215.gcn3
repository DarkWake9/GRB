K.L. Page (U. Leicester), M. Capalbi (INAF-IASFPA), M. Perri (SSDC &
INAF-OAR), V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A.
Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), B. Sbarufatti (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U.
Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 220617A (Di Lalla et al. GCN Circ. 32212),
collecting 4.9 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+23.9 ks
and T0+37.1 ks. 

Five uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. Details of these sources are given below.

Please note: due to an error, the original GCN announcing these Swift
observations (GCN 32211) referred to "GRB 220617B", whereas the
observations were of GRB 220617A.
