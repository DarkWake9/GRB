report: 

"The very widefield camera, WIDGET, located at Akeno, Japan, observed
the region of HETE-2 error box for GRB 050408 (GCN 3189, Sakamoto et
al.). We continuously monitored the HETE-2 field-of-view with repeat
of unfiltered 5 sec exposures from 5 hours before the burst time to 4
hours after it. We have not found any optical emission at the
afterglow position reported by Postigo et al. (GCN 3192) during our
observation period. Coadding the ten images around the burst time
yields the 1-sigma limiting magnitude of R~11 listed below, which was
calibrated relative to USNO B1.0 catalogue.
