S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

During 21 December more than 30 SGR-like bursts
were detected by Konus-Wind and Helicon-Coronas-F
with peak fluxes varied from 5e-7 to 8e-5 erg /cm2 s.
The time interval between bursts varied from seconds to hours.

The triangulation of several these bursts
indicated that their origin is SGR 1806-20.

This is the second series of bursts from this source.
The previous one was detected on 5 October (GCN 2769).
Now we have the data till 01:28 UT December 22.
The last burst is seen at 00:50:52 s UT in
the Helicon background data.

Details on triangulation and the full list of bursts
with their characteristics will be given later.
