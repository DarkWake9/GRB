M. Bradshaw, G. Williams (Steward Observatory),
D. Hartmann (Clemson University) and H.S. Park report on behalf of the 
Super-LOTIS collaboration:

     Starting on Nov 4.456 UT the Super-LOTIS automated telescope imaged
the entire error box for GRB021104 (GCNC #1675; HETE trigger #2434) in the
R-band.  Observations started 3.93 hours after the burst.  A total of 57
images at 60 second integration were analyzed.  We find no optical
transients to the DSS limit in the coadded image.  We also coadded three
sets of 19 images and find no fading sources which are not present in the
DSS.
