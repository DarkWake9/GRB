V. Sharma, V. Bhalerao (IUCAA) and D. Bhattacharya,  A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:


Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed weak detection of GRB170102A (POLAR detection: Yi Zhao et al., GCN 20363) in the 40-200 keV energy range. 
The light curve shows multiple peak structure with stronger peak at 02:51:41 UT, 23 secs after POLAR trigger. The measured peak count rate is 
101.98 counts/sec above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 636.26 counts. The local mean background count rate
was 353 counts/sec.


CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium
of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated
the project.
