on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 18:20:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located XTE_J1701-407 (trigger=813449).  Swift did not slew to the source
because of an observing constraint. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec = 255.433, -40.855, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 01m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -40d 51' 18"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single broad peak
with a duration of about 70 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~45 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon constraint, XRT and UVOT will not be able to make
immediate follow-up observations of this source.  We intend to
make follow-up observations when it comes out of constraint,
early on March 10, UT.
