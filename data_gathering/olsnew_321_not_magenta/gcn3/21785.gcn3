Team:

We performed  a dedicated analysis of AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector
(GRID) data in response to the detection on 2017-08-26 by Chandra of an
X-ray transient (Troja et al., LVC GCN 21765). This source is coincident
with the optical/IR transient SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) possibly
associated with GW170817A.

GRID data analysis covering the SSS17a position was performed in the energy
range 50 MeV - 10 GeV with integration times from 1 to 3 days centered at T0+9
days. Preliminary values of 2-sigma upper limits (UL) are reported below:

3.0e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day integration time
(from 26 August 00:00 UT to 27 August 00:00 UT);

1.9e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a 2-day integration time (from 26 August 00:00
UT to 28 August 00:00 UT);

1.3e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a 3-day integration time (from 25 August 00:00
UT to 28 August 00:00 UT).

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
