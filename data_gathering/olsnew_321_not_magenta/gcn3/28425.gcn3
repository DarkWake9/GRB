report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the INTEGRAL-detected
burst GRB 200914A (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 28419), collecting 3.2
ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+8.9 ks and T0+49.2 ks. 


One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected consistent with being
within 148 arcsec of the INTEGRAL position, it is below the RASS limit
and shows no definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the present time
we cannot confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this source are
given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  254.5202  =  16:58:4.84
  Dec (J2000.0): -36.2782  =  -36:16:41.6
  Error: 6.5 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (2.42 [+1.23, -0.93])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 53 arcsec from INTEGRAL position.
  Flux: (10.0 [+5.0, -3.8])e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Within the 90% error circle of Source 1 we note the presence of a
relatively bright IR source reported in the 2MASS and AllWISE
catalogues (2MASS 16580467-3616436 / AllWISE J165804.63-361643.5).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021033.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
