M. Nysewanderreport:

Skynet observed the Swift/XRT localization of GRB 110520A (Swift 
trigger#453747) with the Dolomites Astronomical Observatory located at 
the Carlo Magno Hotel Spa Resort in Italy.  Due to local twilight, 
observations in SDSS g',r',i' and z' did not begin until ~25 minutes 
after the trigger.

We do not detect an optical transit within the Swift error circle in any 
filter.   Our earliest time photometry yields the following 3-sigma 
limiting magnitudes: g' 17.8 (mean time of 26.78 minutes after trigger), 
r' 19.7 (mean time of 31.32 minutes after trigger, two combined 
exposures), i' 18.5 (mean time of 37.10 minutes after trigger, two 
combined exposures), z' 17.8 (mean time of 41.95 minutes after trigger) 
based on comparison ~6 nearby SDSS sources.
