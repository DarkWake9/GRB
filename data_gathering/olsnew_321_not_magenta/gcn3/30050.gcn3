DATE:    21/05/19 15:38:55 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Dunwoody at UCD  <rachel.dunwoody@ucdconnect.ie>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

At 06:38:53.86 UT on 19 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210519A (trigger 643099138 / 210519277).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 187.9, Dec = -40.2(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 31m, -40d 12'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75 degrees.
