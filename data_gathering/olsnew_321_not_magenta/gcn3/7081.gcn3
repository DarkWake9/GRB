Using a partial data set from T-122 to T+10 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071112C (trigger #296504)
(Stratta, et al., GCN Circ. 7059).  Because of the unusually short time
between detection of GRB 071112B (Perri, et al., GCN Circ. 7058) and
this burst, we have only a partial data set.  This analysis is based on 
BAT survey data rather than "event" data. No event data were created for 
this burst.  In particular, the fluence quoted below does not include the 
tail of the peak, though it appears to include about 80% of the total 
fluence.  The T90 period and our estimate of the 1-second peak photon 
flux are a little more uncertain than usual as well, and the quoted 
errors have been increased to  reflect this.

The BAT ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 39.218 +28.368 
{02h 36m 52.3s,+28d 22' 04"} [deg; J2000] +- 1.0 arcmin, (radius, 
sys+stat, 90% containment).  The burst was in the fully-coded field of 
view.

The burst consisted of a single FRED peak. T90 (15-350 keV) is 
(15 +- 2) sec (estimated error including systematics).

The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.09 +- 0.07.
The fluence for the period T-122 to T+10 seconds (including about 
80% of the total fluence) in the 15-150 keV band is 
(3.0 +- 0.4) x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
from T+0 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 8 +- 1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
