of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR telescope system responded to Swift trigger
315615 (Stroh et al., GCN 7910) under good observing conditions.
Our narrow-field instruments began observing the location at
10:14:06.47 UTC, 28.8 s after the Swift trigger.  We detect no
counterpart at the improved XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 7914).
The limiting magnitudes of our unfiltered observations when
calibrated to the USNO-B1 R-band are given in the following table.
The GRB location was also within the field of view of our
continuous all-sky monitoring system.  We can place 3 sigma limits
at or below magnitude 9.4 during the time period within 2
minutes both before and after the trigger.
