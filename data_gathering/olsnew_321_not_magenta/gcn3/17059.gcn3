I.V. Sokolov (TF INASAN, Russia), V.N. Komarova, A.S Moskvitin,
V.V. Sokolov, T.S.Sokolova (SAO RAS, Russia), report:

We observed the field of GRB 141109A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 17037)
with the 2-meter telescope Zeiss-2000 (Terskol peak) on
November, 10, in 20.7 hours after the trigger.
10 x 300 sec. images in I filter were obtained.

The transient discovered by REM (Covino, GCN 17039) is clearly
detected in the stack frame. The OT magnitude is I = 21.1 +/- 0.1.
Photometry is based on the nearby SDSS stars.  Their magnitudes
were converted with the transformation equations from Lupon, 2005.
