TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2324
SUBJECT: GRB030725, possible optical transient
DATE:    03/07/26 02:27:14 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

Berto Monard of Bronberg Observatory, Pretoria South Africa reports,
on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy Network, the possible
detection of an optical transient to GRB030725 (=H2779; Shirasaki
et al., GCN 2322).

  The location of the OT is estimated to be (J2000)
  RA: 20 33 59.49
  Dec: -50 40 56.0

  The OT shows a fading behavior (starting 7.1hrs after burst):

GRB030725   030725.788   18.8  Unfiltered with a red zeropoint
GRB030725   030725.848   19.0  Unfiltered with a red zeropoint
GRB030725   030725.938   19.6  Unfiltered with a red zeropoint

  Objects from the UCAC1 catalog were used for photometry and astrometry.

The FTS images will be posted shortly to ftp.aavso.org in the
grb/GRB030725 directory.
