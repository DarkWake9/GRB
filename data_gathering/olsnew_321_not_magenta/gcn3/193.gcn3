TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  193
SUBJECT: GRB981220, Correction to GCN 179
DATE:    99/01/13 09:07:17 GMT
FROM:    Elena Pian at ITESRE-CNR,Bologna  <pian@tesre.bo.cnr.it>

N. Masetti, E. Palazzi, E. Pian (ITESRE-CNR, Bologna), by apologizing with
the GCN readers, would like to notify them about a change in GCN N. 179
(optical ESO-NTT observations of GRB981220): the observation time of the B
and I observations is incorrect, and should be modified from 'Dec
23.04-23.07 UT' to 'Dec 24.04-24.07 UT'.

Therefore, the upper limit of B > 25.4 given in GCN 191 implies a
variation of more than 1 magnitude in ~3.5 hours, namely a much steeper
lower limit for the power-law decay index than that suggested in GCN 191.
