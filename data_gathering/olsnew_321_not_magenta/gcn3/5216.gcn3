TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5216
SUBJECT: GRB 060604 optical photometry
DATE:    06/06/05 10:27:29 GMT
FROM:    Nial Tanvir at IofA U.Cambridge  <nrt@ast.cam.ac.uk>

N. Tanvir (U. of Hertfordshire), E. Rol (U. of Leicester)
and P. Hewett (IoA, Cambridge) report:

We imaged the Swift detected burst GRB 060604 (Page et al. GCN 5212)
with the AUX-port camera on the WHT at June 5.169 UT.  A 300s R-band exposure
shows a source at the position of the UVOT counterpart which has apparently
faded, thus confirming the afterglow ID.

By comparison with the two nearby USNO stars, we estimate a magnitude
of R=21.4 with an uncertainty (given the rough calibration) of 0.3 mag.
