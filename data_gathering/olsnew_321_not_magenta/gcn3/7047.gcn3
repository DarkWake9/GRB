BOOTES collaboration,

report:

"The robotic telescope BOOTES-2 located at Estación Experimental
de La Mayora (EELM-CSIC) in southern Spain followed automatically
the INTEGRAL GRB 071109 (Mereghetti et al, GCN 7046). Images
were taken under non-optimum conditions (GRB location at high
airmass and thick cirruses passing) starting 59s after the GRB (31s
after the GCN notice).

We do not detect any new source within the INTEGRAL/IBIS error
box down to our unfiltered, USNO-A2 calibrated magnitude of ~13.0
in our first exposures ranging between 20:37:05 and 20:37:20 UT.
Further analysis is ongoing.

Note the moderate extinction in the line of sight: E(B-V) = 0.61,
i.e. Ar = 1.46."
