report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:04:22.41  UT on 01 October 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 151001A (trigger 465404666 / 151001628)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT and XRT
(M. Stamatikos et al. 2015, GCN 18373)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.


The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 22 degrees.


The GBM light curve has a duration (T90) of about 15.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.1 s to T0+4.1 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.54 +/- 0.21 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 213.80 +/- 36.90 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.798 +/- 0.195)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.75 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.2 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
