of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR telescope system responded to Swift trigger
330856 (Baumgartner et al., GCN 8330) under fair observing conditions.
Our narrow-field instruments began observing the location at
05:24:17.13 UTC, 24.4 s after the Swift trigger and during the end
of the Gamma-Ray emitting interval.  We detect the optical counterpart
reported by Baumgartner et al. (GCN 8330) and Covino et al. (GCN 8331).
We first detect the counterpart at R~16.4 at approximately 90s after
the Swift trigger time.  The counterpart brightens over the next 50
seconds to magnitude R~15.4 and then begins fading steadily.  Our
unfiltered images were calibrated against the USNO-B1 R-band.  The
following table gives selected observations, not corrected for
extinction, from this event.
