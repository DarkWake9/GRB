S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
S.Toscano (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 70 s  has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:47:20 UT of September 3.

Its refined  coordinates (J2000)  are:

  R.A.: 82.1334 deg
  DEC.: -0.1252 deg

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a FRED profile and a fluence of about 10^-6 erg/cmq (20-200 
keV).

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
