BeppoSAX GRB000424  


On April 24 at 18:18:07 UT a burst (GRB000424: BATSE trigger 8086)
was detected in WFC (2-26 keV). BeppoSAX GRBM was switched-off because of
proximity to SAGA.
The position is:
 
R.A.= 104.718
 
Decl.= 49.873
 
with an error radius of 2.5'.
 
A fast position distribution and a follow -up with BeppoSAX NFI could not
be performed because of the holiday period in Italy (see also GCN 634 and
BeppoSAX mail n.00/06).
