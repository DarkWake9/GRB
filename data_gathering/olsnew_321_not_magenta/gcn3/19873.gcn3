and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160824B (Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 19856;
INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7538) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 14:21:12.34 on 24 August 2016.  The burst signal was seen by
all CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing
script, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak starting at T+0.5 sec, peaking at
T+1.5 sec and ending at T+4 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data
is 2.7 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
