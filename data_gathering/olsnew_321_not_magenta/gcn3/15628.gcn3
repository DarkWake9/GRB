SUBJECT: GRB 131229A: P60 nondetection

D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope automatically responded to GRB 
131229A (Page et al., GCN 15627) and began a sequence of 60-second image 
starting at 06:44:54 UT, 5.5 minutes after the burst.

In the initial r-band image we identify no sources within the XRT error 
circle down to a limiting magnitude of R > 20.5.  No source in the error 
circle is detected in the i- or z-band filters either.

We do detect a source not present in USNO B1.0 well north of the XRT 
error circle at RA=05:40:55.702, dec=-04:23:21.11 (J2000).  It does not 
appear to be fading in images taken so far.

Further P60 observations are ongoing.  NIR observations are encouraged.
