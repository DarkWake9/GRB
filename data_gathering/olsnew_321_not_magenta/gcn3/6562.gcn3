report on behalf of the Watcher collaboration:

The Watcher 40cm robotic telescope, located at Boyden Observatory,
South Africa, began imaging the field of GRB 070621
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN 6560) at 23:18:21 UT, 40s after the Swift trigger.

Our first 10s unfiltered image shows no new source in the XRT error circle
down to an R-band limiting magnitude of 16.1. Subsequent 10s exposures
were combined to create a 360s exposure with a mean time of 23:21:47
(247s after the trigger). No new source is detected in the XRT error
circle down to an R-band limiting magnitude of 17.9.
Observations are ongoing.
