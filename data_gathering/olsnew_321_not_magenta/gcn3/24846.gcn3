P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya, T. Khanam and A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 190613B, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #24806), Swift detection (D'Ai A. et al., GCN #24807), BALROG (Burgess J. et al., GCN #24808), Swift-XRT (Beardmore A.P. et al., GCN #24812), Swift-BAT (Ukwatta T.N. et al., GCN #24820), Insight-HXMT/HE (Luo Q. et al., GCN #24829) and Konus-Wind (Svinkin D. et al., GCN #24844).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple pulses of emission with the strongest peak at 10:47:02.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 439 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1298 cts. The local mean background count rate was 654 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 11.75 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
