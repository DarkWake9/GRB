As observed by RHESSI, GRB060928 (Hurley et al., GCN 5684) displayed two
periods of emission.  The first had a duration of ~14s starting at about
T0 = 01:17:05 UT.  The preliminary fit to the time-integrated RHESSI
spectrum from T0 - T0+14s between 500 keV and 10 MeV is simple power law with

alpha = -2.21 +0.85/-1.74
(90% confidence levels).

The 500 keV-10 MeV fluence is 1.5 E-5 erg/cm^2.

The second outburst began at T1 = 01:20:05 UT and had a duration of ~25s.
A spectral fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum
from T1 - T1+25s between 30 keV and 10 MeV gives a cutoff power law with

alpha = -1.36 +0.05/-0.04
E0 = 2090 +480/-370 keV
Epeak = 1340 +/- 220 keV

The 30 keV-10 MeV fluence is 2.43 +/- 0.91 E-4 erg/cm^2.
