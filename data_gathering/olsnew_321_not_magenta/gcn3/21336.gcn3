and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170708B (Konus-Wind trigger time on
20:37:00.639 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 20:36:54.18 on 8 July 2017.  The burst signal was only seen by the SGM
instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T+2 sec,
peaks at T+4 sec and ends at T+9 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM
data is 5.6 +- 0.7 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
