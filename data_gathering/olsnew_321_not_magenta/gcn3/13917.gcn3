Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121028A (trigger #536897)
(Starling, et al., GCN Circ. 13913).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 271.903, -2.298 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 07m 36.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 17' 52.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single pulse starting at ~T-0.9 sec, 
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending ~T+4 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.8 +- 0.7 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+3.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.79 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
