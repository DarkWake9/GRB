AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G268556 (Shawhan et al., GCN
#20364) we performed an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector
(GRID) data on different timescales. On LIGO trigger time (T0), the GRID
exposure covered about 40% of the LIGO localization region; this region
was observed with off-axis angles between 0 and 70 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 30 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 1000 sec centered at T0.
Typical 3-sigma preliminary upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible G268556 localization region are reported below:

2.0e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s,
3.4e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode.
Additional GRID data analysis on longer time intervals is in progress.
