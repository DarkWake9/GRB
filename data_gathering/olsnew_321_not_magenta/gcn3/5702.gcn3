K.Yamaoka, M.Ohno, Y.Fukazawa, T.Takahashi, M.Tashiro, Y. Terada,
T.Murakami, and K.Makishima on behalf of the Suzaku WAM team, report:

RHESSI, Konus, and Suzaku observed a short duration (<~ 1 s) gamma-ray
burst at 60328 s.  We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA, Dec=193.534, 11.116 degrees, with radius 77.720 +/- 2.080 degrees
(3 sigma).  The BAT position for Swift  232585 lies 0.051 degrees from the center line of this annulus, and occurs at 60350 s.  Thus, this Swift burst
might be the same as the earlier IPN event.  The spectrum of the IPN
burst will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.  If it turns out
to be a hard spectrum burst, then the Swift event could be the soft
spectrum portion or afterglow of it.

This IPN annulus can be improved with data from Ulysses and Odyssey,
which are expected within 24 hours.
