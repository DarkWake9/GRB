Julie McEnery on behalf of the Milagro collaboration reports:

Milagro searched for GeV/TeV gamma-ray emission from GRB 021104 (GCN
1675), GRB 021112 (GCN 1682) and GRB 021113 (GCN 1686) during the
burst durations reported by the HETE WXM (26, 5 and 20 seconds
respectively).  No evidence for prompt GeV/TeV emission was found from
any of these bursts. A preliminary analysis (assuming a differential
photon spectral index of -2.4) gives an upper limit on the fluence at
the 99.9% confidence level of:

J(E 0.2-20 TeV) < 3.4 * 10^(-6) erg cm^(-2) for GRB 021104 and,
J(E 0.2-20 TeV) < 2.6 * 10^(-6) erg cm^(-2) for GRB 021112 and,
J(E 0.2-20 TeV) < 2.8 * 10^(-6) erg cm^(-2) for GRB 021113
