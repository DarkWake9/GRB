R. Chornock, W. Li, A. V. Filippenko, and the KAIT GRB team (UC Berkeley)
report:

A faint (mag~19) optical source is present in Katzman Automatic Imaging
Telescope (KAIT) images at coordinates (J2000) 12:10:58.82  +39:55:33.9
The first detection was in a 45sec unfiltered image starting at 10:05:19 UT.
This position is consistent with the XRT position (GCN 6302) and the source does
not appear to be present in DSS images.
