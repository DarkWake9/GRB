Skynet observed the Swift/BAT localization of GRB 130719A (Marshall et 
al., GCN 15012, Swift trigger #562625) with four 16" telescopes of the 
PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile.  Starting at 2013-07-19, 19:17 UT and 
continuing until 09:20 UT (t=3.53-4.84h post-trigger), it took ~28 
160-sec exposures in each of the BVRI bands. We did not detect a 
credible afterglow candidate within the 3 arcmin radius of the Swift/BAT 
error circle, which was centered on RA 05:56:09.4, Dec -11:35:04.

We stacked all the images in each band and obtained 3-sigma limiting 
magnitudes on any afterglow at t~4.2h:
Filter       B       V       R       I
Mag        >21.2   >20.6   >20.7   >20.3

Magnitudes are Vega magnitudes, calibrated to 3 USNO-B1/NOMAD stars in 
the field, and have not been corrected for the expected line-of-sight 
Milky Way dust extinction E(B-V)~0.7 (Schlegel et al. 1998).

No further Skynet observations are scheduled.
