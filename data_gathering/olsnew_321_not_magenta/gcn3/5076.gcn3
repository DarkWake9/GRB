At 06:36:01 UT Swift-BAT triggered on GRB 060505 (Trigger #208654).
The onboard imaging detected a 6.4 sigma excess.
This is below our (6.5 sigma) threshold for ground notification
and automatic slew.  Subsequent ground analysis imaged a different
selection of the data and found a convincing 8.5 sigma excess at
(RA, Dec) = 331.765, -27.819 {22h 07m 04s, -27d 49' 09s} (J2000)

The light curve shows a weak burst, ~1500 cts/sec (15-350 keV) 1 sec
after the trigger. T90 is ~4 seconds.
