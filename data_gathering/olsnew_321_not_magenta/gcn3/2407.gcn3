Y. Urata, T. Soyano, T. Tamagawa on behalf of the Kiso GRB team,
J. Jugaku (NAOJ), T. Kawamoto (Hokkaido University) report:

"We have observed XRF030824 field (M. Galassi et al. GCN 2402) using
the 105cm Schmidt telescope (Kiso Observatory, Institute of Astronomy,
the University of Tokyo) and 2kx2k CCD camera with 2 degree objective
prism from 76 to 153 min after the burst (from 16 min after HETE-2
alert).

 We have checked two candidates reported by Klotz et al (GCN 2406)
comparing with Palomar images (Fox and Hunt GCN 2364 and 2369). We
could not find these two candidates brighter than R~17 limited
magnitude.

 We have also observed this field again at the end of September using
the same instruments. Further analysis is in progress.

 We thank to Dr. D. Fox for suppling Palomar images."
