At 08:37:27 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060116 (trigger=177533).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 84.699d,-5.449d {05h 38m 48s,-05d 26' 54"} (J2000), with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows
a multi-peak structure with a total duration of ~35 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at several times after the trigger.

XRT began observing the field at 08:40:00.75 UT, 154 sec after the BAT trigger.
The on-board detection algorithm did not centroid on a source due to
insufficient counts so no prompt X-ray position is available.  The XRT prompt
spectrum and lightcurve show no signficant X-ray emission in the field,
suggesting that any X-ray counterpart to this burst is faint.  Further analysis
will require processing of the XRT full telemetry data following the next
ground station contact at 09:32 UT.

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 200 seconds with the V filter
starting 153 seconds after the BAT trigger.  No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products.  The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers
25% of the BAT error circle.  The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been
about 18th mag.  The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle.  The list of sources is
typically complete to about 18.0 mag.  No correction has been made for
the expected visual extinction of about 0.9 magnitudes.
