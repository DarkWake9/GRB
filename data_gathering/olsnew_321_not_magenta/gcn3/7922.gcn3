report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the BAT  error circle of the Swift trigger 315630 (Pagani et al.,
GCN 7912) with the TLS 1.34m Schmidt telescope under moderate seeing 
conditions (seeing >2 arcsec). We obtained in total 12 x 300 sec images in R 
band starting at 00:16 UT  and finishing at 01:19 UT. We did not find any new 
source in the stacked image down to the 3-sigma limiting magnitude of 22.5 
mag calibrated on USNO-B1 field stars.
