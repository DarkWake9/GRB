During the night of 07/05/18 we observed the OT of GRB070518
(Guidorzi et al., GCN 6415) with the 1.52 cm telescope 
of the Bologna Observatory in Loiano under moderate 
sky conditions (seeing ~ 2"). 
The OT flux was slightly blended with a nearby star (R ~ 18.7).
To correct for the blending we employed difference image analysis techniques.

By adding two consecutive 30 min exposures in the Rc filter at
mean time 23.5 UT we find Rc = 22.3 +/- 0.2 based on the USNO-A2.0 catalog.

Our coadded image have been posted in our public directory
