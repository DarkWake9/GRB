K. McGowan (MSSL), E. Rol (U. Leicester), J. Nousek (PSU),
F. Marshall, N. Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift UVOT team:

Using summed images from Swift/UVOT of the field of
GRB 050716 (Rol et al., GCN 3623), taken from 99
seconds after the BAT trigger, no new source is detected
within the XRT error circle (Hurkett et al., GCN 3630) in
any of the six filters down to the following 3-sigma
magnitude upper limits:

Filter   Exposure (s)  T_mid (s)   3-sig limit
V        178            487        19.1
B        979           3121        21.1
U        978           2660        20.7
UVW1     178           2200        19.7
UVM2      88            545        19.5
UVW2     755           3468        20.8

where T_mid is the mid-point of the summed observation.

We caution that the instrument is not yet fully
calibrated and that the magnitude limits presented here
may need to be refined.
