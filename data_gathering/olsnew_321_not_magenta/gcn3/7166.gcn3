D. Denisenko (IKI, Moscow), S. Korotkiy (Ka-Dar obs.), T. Kryachko
(Astrotel obs., KSU), B. Satovskiy (Astrotel obs., KSU),
K. Sokolovsky (ASC LPI, SAI MSU) report: 

We took three 300-sec unfiltered images of NGC 2770 between 19:00 and 19:18 
UT
on 2008 Jan 10 with 300-mm f/7.7 robotic telescope equipped with STL-11000M 
CCD camera. The telescope is located at Kazan State University Astrotel 
observatory (Karachay-Cherkessia, Russia). The optical source reported by 
Deng & Zhu (GCN 7160) and Thoene et al. (GCN 7161) is clearly detected on 
individual images with SNR=18. Using the same comparison star as in D'Elia 
et al. (GCN 7162), we have measured unfiltered magnitude (with R zero-point) 
of the transient 18.1+/-0.1
(JD 2454476.2979).
