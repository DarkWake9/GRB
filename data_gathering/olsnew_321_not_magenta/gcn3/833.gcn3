report on behalf of the BeppoSAX team:


We have found an error in the application of a conversion factor which
underestimates the fluxes distributed in GCN n.832

The correct value of the average flux (at T=29.25) is

 F(1.6-10 keV)= (2.6+\-0.6) 10^-13 erg/cm2/s

We have also carefully checked different background subtraction methods,
finding that the corresponding systematic effect amouts to less than about
15%. This has been included in the flux error quoted above.

All the other results on the fading behaviour and on the spectral
shape presented in GCN 832 remain unaffected.
