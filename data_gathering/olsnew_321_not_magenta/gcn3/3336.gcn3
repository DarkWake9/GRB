TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3336
SUBJECT: Retraction of Swift-BAT trigger 116145

FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <Scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>

S. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=116145) at 15:06:48 UT is not due to a GRB.
The trigger was the result of an error in the BAT flight software
for processing image triggers (not the normal rate triggers).  That pathway
in the BAT FSW has now been disabled. 

Some GCN Notice clients received FOM_OBSERVE and SC_SLEW notices
on this trigger.  The BAT_POSITION notice was correctly identified
as a non-GRB and blocked from distribution by the GCN filtering code,
but the FOM_AT and SC_SLEW were not blocked.  This error in the filtering code
will be fixed.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this false-positive may have caused.
