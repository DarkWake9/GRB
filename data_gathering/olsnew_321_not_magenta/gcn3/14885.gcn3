report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130612A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 557976) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 9.3h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
20 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We have not detected the OT detected by Racusin et al.
(GCNC 14874), Melandri et al. (GCNC 14875):

 From t0+9.3h to t0+10.2h  Rlim = 21.2

Magnitudes are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
