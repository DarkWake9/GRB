P. U. Fynbo, D. Watson, J. M. Castro Ceron, K. Pedersen, H. Pedersen,
and J. Sollerman (DARK Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute) report:

We have performed PSF-matched image subtraction on the images acquired
by Jensen et al. (GCN #3589).  The images were obtained from the Danish
1.54m+DFOSC at La Silla on 2005 July 11.3 and 12.3 UT.

PSF-matched image subtraction using the Pan-STARRS Optimal Image
Subtraction (POI Sub) code reveals a residual, in the sense that the
source fades between the first and the second epochs.  The position of
the variable source corresponds to the source identified by Jensen et
al. (GCN #3589) on the edge of a nearby galaxy (z=0.16; Price, Roth &
Fox, GCN #3605) as consistent with the Chandra source (Fox et al., GCN
#3585).  This detection of optical variability increases the likelihood
that this source is the afterglow of the short/hard GRB 050709.
