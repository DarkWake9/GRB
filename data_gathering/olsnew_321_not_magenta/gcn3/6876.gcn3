D. Malesani (DARK), V. D'Elia (INAF/OAR), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), G. 
Andreuzzi, A. Garcia  de Gurtubai (INAF/TNG), and E. Maiorano (INAF/IASF 
Bo), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 071010A (Moretti et al., GCN 
6859; Klotz et al., GCN 6860) with the TNG telescope located in the 
Canary Islands. Observations were carried out with the NICS instrument 
equipped with the H filter, with mean time Oct 10.82 UT (15.7 hr after 
the GRB).

At the position reported by Bloom et al. (GCN 6861), we clearly detect a 
pointlike object, with H = 16.62 +- 0.05. We note that this value is 
remarkably bright. Assuming typical afterglow colors (Fnu propto nu^-1), 
this corresponds to R ~ 19. When compared to the Keck photometry 
reported by Perley et al. (GCN 6872), this may suggest a flat segment or 
even a flaring behaviour. Alternatively, the afterglow may be very red.

We thus encourage further observations to characterize the afterglow 
light curve and spectrum.
