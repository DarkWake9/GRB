(NBI Copenhagen) report:

We have obtained further imaging of the optical afterglow of GRB060614
(GCN 5252) with the Danish 1.54m telescope and DFOSC on La Silla in the
R-band at June 19-21. The afterglow has flattened from the power-law
decay reported by Thoene et al. (GCN 5272). Also, the source is clearly
resolved in the latest images. Hence, the host galaxy is most likely now
contributing most of the detected flux. There is not yet any sign of
an emerging supernova. Given the low redshift of GRB060614 (GCN 5275,
GCN 5276) we can conclude that if there is a supernova associated with
GRB060614 it is either intrinsically about 2 magnitudes fainter than
SN2006aj (associated with GRB060218) at a similar time or there is
substantial dust absorption along the line of sigth to the afterglow.
