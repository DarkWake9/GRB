report on behalf of the One-Meter Two Hemisphere (1M2H) collaboration:

in the process of following up galaxies in the localization region of LIGO/Virgo collaboration event S190814bv (GCN #25324) provided in the updated map of GCN #25333, we observed the following galaxies with the Direct 2k x 2k detector on the 1m Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory, Mt. Hamilton, California on UT 2019 August 15.  Each field was targeted toward a galaxy in the localization region and represents a 6.4 arcmin x 6.4 arcmin pointing centered at the indicated coordinates.  All images were 2 minute r' band exposures, and we indicate the approximate 3-sigma limiting magnitude of each image.  Comparing to PS1 r band images of the same regions, we did not detect any transients to this depth.

In addition, we observed the fields around DESGW transients (GCN #25336) 2019nmd and 2019nme.  2019nmd was observed in i' band for 10 minutes and 2019nme was observed in i' for 5 minutes.  At the time of observations, we did not detect either transient to the approximate 3-sigma limiting magnitude indicated below.

Object   RA           Dec          MJD             Limiting Magnitude
2019nmd  00:51:35.95  -22:27:02.5  58710.48096     20.6
2019nme  00:50:39.65  -22:12:17.6  58710.49475     20.3

For 2019nmd, our limits are comparable to the discovery magnitude and in the same band as the original report of GCN #25336.  However, for 2019nme our limits are significantly deeper than the discovery report, which suggests that this transient is either extremely rapidly declining in i' band (1 mag in the 5.2 hours between DESGW and Nickel observations), an uncatalogued minor planet, or non-astrophysical in nature.
