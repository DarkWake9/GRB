SUBJECT: GRB210413B: further Swift-XRT observations

A. Dâ€™Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) 
and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of the
ground-detected burst GRB 200413B (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 
Cir. 29819), collecting a total of 9.2 ks of Photon Counting (PC) 
mode data between T0+2.1 days and T0+37 days. 

The uncatalogued candidate X-ray source (Source 1) reported 
in Kennea et al. (GCN Circ. 29827) which had also a possible 
UV counterpart (Siegel, GCN Circ. 29912) is still detected in 
XRT at a count rate consistent with the first observations. 
We thus rule out a possible association with the burst.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are at
