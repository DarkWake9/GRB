Guy Pooley, on behalf of the AMI collaboration (Cavendish Astrophysics,
University of Cambridge) reports further to GCN9003:

We observed the field of GRB 090313 again with the
AMI Large Array in the frequency range 14.5 to 17.5 GHz.
The observation was on 2009 Mar 16 23h51m to Mar 17 02h50m 
(3d 18h after the burst). 

We measured a flux density of 860 microJy with an rms
noise of 75 microJy, at a position consistent with that reported in
GCN9003. The spectrum over that frequency band is consistent with 
a spectral index of zero, but is not well constrained because of 
the relatively narrow bandwidth and faint flux.

Since the flux density has not changed significantly, while 
radio detections of GRBs at this early stage are often highly variable,
the association of this source with the GRB is currently not confirmed.
