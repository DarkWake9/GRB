D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

This burst (GCN 1702) was also observed by RHESSI.  A combination of
triangulation, Earth-blocking, and the Konus ecliptic latitude
determination limits the arrival direction to that part of the annulus
(RA, Decl(2000)=181.744, 35.203 degrees, radius 41.845 +/-0.093
degrees, 3 sigma) to the portion between RA, Dec = 136, +22 degrees and
RA, Dec = 147, +8 degrees.

Only minor improvements to this localization will be possible.
