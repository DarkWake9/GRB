We have searched for untriggered events from the newly discovered SGR
1935+2154 using the daily GBM data of 6 days, from July 3 to July 8.  We
identified 3 bursts from the direction of the SGR at the following times
coinciding with the Swift BAT observations (Cummings, GCN 16530), all on
July 5:

1: 09:32:49 UT (426245572 Fermi MET =  BAT trigger 603488)
2: 09:37:35 UT (426245857 Fermi MET =  Trig+285.8 s)
3: 09:41:07 UT (426246069 Fermi MET = Trig+497.4 s)
We note that the 3rd burst was extremely weak, detected with much lower
significance (<3.5 sigma).  The SGR was not visible to GBM at the time of the
fourth event detected with BAT at Trig+27157 s (426272729 MET).  No other
events from the direction of the SGR were identified in the GBM data at
>4.5-sigma level.
