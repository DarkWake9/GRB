B. P. Gompertz, K. L. Page (U. Leicester) and M. Stamatikos
(OSU/NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 2.1 ks of XRT data for GRB 141212B (Stamatikos  et al.
GCN Circ. 17159),  from 350 s to 45.2 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 179 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode.

The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Page et al. (GCN
Circ. 17174)

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.05 (+0.08, -0.06).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.1 (+0.4, -0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  7 (+12, -5) x 10^20 cm^-2,
consistent with the Galactic value of 2.2 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.0 x 10^-11 (3.6 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the WT-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     7 (+12, -5) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.2 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.1 (+0.4, -0.3)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.05, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 7.2 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.1 x
10^-13 (2.5 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
