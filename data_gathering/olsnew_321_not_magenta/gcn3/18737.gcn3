The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the instruments
are switched off around the perigee passage, every 2.6 days, to prevent
radiation induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time of the LIGO/Virgo
trigger G211117 (2015-12-26 03:38:53 UTC) the spacecraft was close
to the perigee between the orbits number 1625 and 1626. The data
from the anti-coincidence monitor are not available from 2015-12-25 20:57
to 2015-12-26 07:46 UTC. Yet, the narrow-field hard X-ray instruments
of INTEGRAL were pointing to the Cygnus region when the operations
resumed at 2015-12-26 07:59  (about 4.5 hours after the trigger), too far
from the trigger high probability zones to yield any meaningful limit on 
possible
long-lasting electromagnetic counterparts of the gravitational wave 
trigger.
