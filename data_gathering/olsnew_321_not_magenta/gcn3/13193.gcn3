The wide field "Pi of the Sky South" telescope, installed in
the private observatory of Alain Maury in San Pedro de Atacama 
(http://grb.fuw.edu.pl/pi/index.html#spda_site.htm) observed coordinates 
of the GRB 120328B prior, during and after the reported IPN flash 
detection. No new source was identified. Following limiting magnitudes 
have been set:

t_start - t0 [s]    t_exp     start (UT)  end (UT)     3-sigma limit

      -15             10s       06:26:06   06:26:16         11.6
      +1              10s       06:26:22   06:26:32         11.6
      +16             10s       06:26:37   06:26:47         11.6
      -165          20x10s      06:23:36   06:28:32         12.2
      +152          20x10s      06:28:53   06:33:54         12.3

where limit is based on the reference star magnitudo in V filter.
