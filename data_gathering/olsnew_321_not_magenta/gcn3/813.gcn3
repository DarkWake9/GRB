The precise astrometry using 43 USNO_A2.0 stars yields:
R.A. = 17h04m09s.71 +/- 0s.05, Decl. = +51o47'10".0 +/- 0".5
(2000.0), which shows quite good agreement with the reported
positions.  Oksanen reports that every POSS scan examined at USNO
server does not show this object.  Thus it is highly probable that
this object is the same object as a candidate of the afterglow of GRB 
000926.

  The magnitude was about 20.0CR at Sept. 28.8 UT
(comparison star is USNO_A2.0 star at 17h04m01s.21, +51o46'19".9
(2000.0), rmag = 17.1, same as Halpern et al. (GCN 806)).
Note that it is somewhat brighter than Hjorth et al. (GCN 809) report.
