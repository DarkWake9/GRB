collaboration

The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope (Hawaii) reacted to the Swift burst 
GRB070419A
(Stamatikos et al. GCN 6302). Observations were delayed by scheduled 
engineering
work and only started about 37 min after the trigger time. BRi 
observations continued
until 104min after the trigger.

We detect the optical transient reported by Chornock et al (GCN 6304) 
in R and i' band filters
and measure a power law decay index of ~ 1.5 throughout the hour of 
observation.

  UTC	minutes_since_trigger	Mag
10:49:46.5	50.36	g' > 19.8 (limit only)
10:51:20.8	51.91	r' = 20.37
10:53:07.9	53.70	i' = 20.22
Magnitudes are based on comparison with SDSS magnitudes of the adjacent 
star
SDSS J121057.55+395539.9.

The target has set and further observations are not currently ongoing 
with this telescope.
