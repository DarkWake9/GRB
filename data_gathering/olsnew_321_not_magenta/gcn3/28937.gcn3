The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:07:45 UT on 21 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201121B (trigger 627620870.546802 / 201121130).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 234.9, Dec = -38.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 39m, -38d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 101.0 degrees.
