S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
T.Favre (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 10 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 23:49:42 UT of February 21, 2016.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=   232.0818 deg
DEC.=   -28.4337 deg

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 1 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 5e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
