SUBJECT: GRB 140606A: Swift-XRT upper limits

M. C. Stroh, J. A. Kennea (PSU), N. Gehrels (GSFC) and D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT began observing the field of GRB 140606A 4.6 ks after the event (Stroh et al., GCN Circ. 16353). In 2.4ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data, no source was found in the revised BAT error circle (Cummings et al., GCN Circ. 16354). The three sigma upper limit (0.5-10 keV) is 7.4e-3 counts s^-1.

The delayed XRT response was due to the XRT anomaly (Burrows and Kennea, GCN Circ. 16356).

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
