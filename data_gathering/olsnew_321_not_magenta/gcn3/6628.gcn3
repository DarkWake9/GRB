D.Grupe (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:


I analyzed the first (and only) orbit of X-ray data of GRB 070714A (BAT 
trigger
284850; Grupe et al. GCN 6619) with a total exposure time of 2.3 ks.
The XRT began observing the field of GRB 070714A at 2007-07-14 03:21:25 UT,
54.4 seconds after the BAT trigger.
Using 799 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting (PC) mode and UVOT V-band
data, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the 
XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, 
Dec =
42.93073, 30.24339 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  02 51 43.37
Dec (J2000): +30 14 36.2

with an uncertainty of 2.0"  (90% confidence radius).


The XRT PC mode light curve shows a fading afterglow with a decay slope of
1.02+\-0.29. The predicted count rate (flux) 24 hours after the burst is 
1.5e-3
counts s-1 (1.4e-13 ergs s-1 cm-2) and 7.3e-4 counts s-1 (6.8e-14 ergs s-1
cm-2) at 48 hours after the trigger.

The X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a single absorbed power law with the
absorption column density in agreement with the Galactic value (NH=9.24e20
cm-2; Dickey & Lockman 1990) and a Photon spectra index Gamma = 
1.68+\-0.23.
