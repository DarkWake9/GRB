The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:47:01 UT on 12 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210812A (trigger 650479626.014242 / 210812699).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 39.7, Dec = 69.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 38m, 69d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 149.0 degrees.
