The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:48:02 UT on 23 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190923A (trigger 590942887.75117 / 190923617).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 8.2, Dec = -11.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 32m, -11d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
