WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 200228B (Laha et al.,
GCN 27254) starting at 11:21:06 UT, 395 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within
the enhanced XRT position error circle (Evans et al., GCN 27256),
neither in single image, nor in the co-add images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
18.0 mag calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
