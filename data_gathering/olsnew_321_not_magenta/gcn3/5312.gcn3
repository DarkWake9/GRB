"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060714 (GCN 5311) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 15:48:11 UT on Jul. 14.
After co-adding a set of 5 images (15:48:11 - 15:52:41 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 17.1 mag. in the position reported by H.A.Krimm et al.(GCN 5311)"
