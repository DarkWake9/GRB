SUBJECT: GRB 140515A: KAIT Optical Upper Limit

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 140515A (D'Avanzo et al.,
GCN 16267) starting at 09:14:22 UT, 106 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect the optical afterglow (Chornock
et al., GCN 16269; Fong et al., GCN 16274) in our
images within the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 16270).
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about 
17.8, and about 17.1,16.9 mag for the V and I bands respectively.
