report:

The 30cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malargue
(Argentina) reacted robotically to the Swift/BAT alert
of GRB191025A (Page et al., GCNC 26072), starting
with a series of 20s unfiltered images at 02:47:17 UT,
i.e. 30s post trigger.

We do not detect any new or strongly variable source at
or around the reported gamma-ray errorbox at single
frames or combined 10 x 20s exposures taken between 30s
and 585s after the initial trigger. The combined
images have a limiting magnitude r'(AB) = 19.1, as
calibrated against the APASS Catalogue.
