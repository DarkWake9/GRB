Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080205 (trigger #302506)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 7250).  The BAT ground-calculated 
position is RA, Dec = 98.261, 62.782 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 6h 33m 2.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 62d 46' 56" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 52%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows at least 3 peaks at about T+2, 
T+65, and T+93 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 106.5 +- 5.0 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-10.1 to T+105.3 sec is best fit by a 
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 2.08 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
2.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T+0.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
