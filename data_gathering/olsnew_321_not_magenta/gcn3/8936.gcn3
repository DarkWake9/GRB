Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090305 (trigger #345127)
(Beardmore et al., GCN 8932).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 241.764, -31.572 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  16h 07m 03.5s
  Dec(J2000) = -31d 34' 20.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
This position is 1.3 arcmin from the optical afterglow reported by
Cenko et al. (GCN Circ 8933). The partial coding was 50%.

The lightcurve consists of two pulses, the first about 0.08 seconds
long and the second about  0.28 seconds long.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
0.4 +- 0.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).  There was
very little emission seen in the BAT low energy band, 15-25 keV.

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+0.4 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 0.86 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
7.5 +- 1.3 x 10^-08 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-0.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
