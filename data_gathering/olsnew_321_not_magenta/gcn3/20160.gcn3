(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161108A  (Beardmore et al., GCN 20145) 
with Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical 
Observatory. We obtained several images in R filter starting on Nov. 08 
(UT) 23:06:16. Within enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN 
20147) we detected a source coinciding with the afterglow of GRB 161014A 
(Malesani et al., GCN 20146; Butler et al., GCN 20149). Preliminary 
photometry of the source is following

Date       UT start   t-T0   Filter   Exp.   OT   Err.  UL
                       (mid, days)     (s)
2016-11-08 23:06:16   0.83869  R      28*120 21.8 0.20  22.0

Our photometry of the afterglow might be  affected by nearby galaxy 
mentioned in GCN 20149 (Malesani et al.)

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars (Lupton transformations):
