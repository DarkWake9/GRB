report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 18:32:47 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 171011A (trigger=778154).  Swift could not slew to the burst
due to the Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 236.761, -10.071 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 47m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 04' 14"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~10,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 11:46 UT on 2018 January 03. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J.D. Gropp (jdg44 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
