The short GRB 220730A (Swift detection: Dichiara et al., GCN Circ 32431;
Swift-BAT refined analysis: Markwardt et al., GCN Circ 32438;
Fermi GBM detection:  Poolakkil & Meegan, GCN Circ 32437)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=56937.381 s UT (15:48:57.381).

The burst light curve shows a single emission pulse
which starts at ~T0-0.032 s and has a duration of ~0.1 s.
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220730_T56937/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a total fluence of (1.20 ± 0.38)x10^-6 erg/cm^2 and
a 16-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0,
of (1.62 ± 0.51)x10^-5 erg/cm^2/s (both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.064 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range by a power law with exponential
cutoff (CPL) model: dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.14(-0.34,+0.40) and Ep = 369(-59,+92) keV (pgstat = 50/54 dof).
A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with alpha = -0.08 (-0.36,+0.42),
beta = -2.61(-1.33, + 0.45), and Ep = 347 (-54, +86) keV (pgstat = 48/53 dof).


All the quoted errors are estimated at the 68% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
