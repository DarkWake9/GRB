S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo 
(ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting at least 100 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 09:49:19 UT of March 5, 2015.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 269.7685 deg
DEC.= -42.6481  deg

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 0.2 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 7e-7 
erg/cmq (over 100 s).

Due to the significance of the detection below the high confidence 
threshold, only an Alert Packet of WEAK type was distributed by IBAS in 
real time (Packet n. 6905). The X-ray afterglow has been detected with 
Swift/XRT (Starling 2015, GCN 17551).
