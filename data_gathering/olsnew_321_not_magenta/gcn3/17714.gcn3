A. S. Moskvitin (SAO RAS) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up
collaboration:

The field of GRB 150413A (Markwardt et al., GCNC 17688) was observed
with the Zeiss-1000, 1-m telescope of SAO RAS. The observations were
carried out on the April, 16, 20:00:28--21:31:31 UT (T-T0 = 3.285 days).
16 x 300 sec. frames in Rc filter were obtained. The OT (Ivanov et al.,GCNC
17689)
is absent in the stacked image, therefore R > 23.0.  The limiting value is
based on
the R2 magnitudes of nearby USNO-B1 stars.

We acknowledge A. S. Pozanenko, O. I. Spiridovova and V. S. Bychkova
for the help in observations.
