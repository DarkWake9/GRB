NUMBER:  2985
SUBJECT: GRB 050126: Detection of NIR afterglow with Keck/NIRC
DATE:    05/01/26 16:42:25 GMT
FROM:    Edo Berger at Carnegie Obs  <eberger@ociw.edu>

E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We imaged the entire 30-arcsec radius XRT error circle of GRB 050126 (GCN
2984) with KeckI/NIRC on January 26.687 UT (4.5 hours after the burst) for
a total of 5 minutes in Ks band.  A comparison to DSS and 2MASS reveals a
single bright source which is not visible in either catalog.  The position
of the NIR afterglow is (J2000):
        RA = 18:32:24.79
        DEC= 42:21:54.0
