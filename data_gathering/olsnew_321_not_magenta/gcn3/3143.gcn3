At 09:53:55 UT Swift-BAT detected trigger number 112453, a bright
burst designated GRB050326.  Due to a TDRSS-to-GCN problem there were
no real-time notices.  The BAT-derived position is (RA,Dec) =
6.857,-71.375 (J2000).  The lightcurve has 5 peaks with a total
duration of ~30 sec.  The peak count rate is ~20,000 cnts/sec.

[GCN OPS NOTE (28mar05):  Per author's request, the trigger number
was changed from ''111453' to '112453'.]
[GCN OPS NOTE (31mar05):  It should be noted that the TDRSS-to-GCN
problem was a problem in the ground portion of the system
of the data flow to GCN.]
