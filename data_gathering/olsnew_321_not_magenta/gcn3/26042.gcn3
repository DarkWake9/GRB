A. Nicuesa Guelbenzu (TLS Tautenburg) reports:

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) performed a first visit of
the field of GRB 191019A (Swift trigger 930285; Simpson et al., GCN 26031)
at 01:35 UT on 2019-10-20, about 10.3 hours after the burst.
Observations were performed at an airmass of 1.02 and a seeing of 2.0
arcsec. Second-epoch observations started at 05:10 UT on the same night
(airmass 1.75, seeing 1.7 arcsec).

The potential afterglow plus host-galaxy complex is clearly detected.
Between the 1st and the 2nd-epoch observations there is  no evidence for
fading in any band (g'r'i'z' as well as in JHKs). The GROND
r'(AB = 19.14 +/- 0.01) and i' (AB = 18.73 +/- 0.01) magnitudes are in
agreement with the NOT observations and the Pan-STARRS catalog (Perley et
al., GCN 26039; Fynbo et al., GCN 26041).

I acknowledge the excellent support from Sam Kim on La Silla in acquiring
these observations
