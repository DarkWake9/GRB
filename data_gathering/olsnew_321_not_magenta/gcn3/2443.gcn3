Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and HETE (H2924: FREGATE and WXM) observed this
burst at 60313 seconds.  Its position was reported in a GCN Notice on
November 11 at 17:55:09.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.1E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.  These numbers
are subject to more than the usual amount of uncertainty, as the
background on Ulysses was about 3 times the normal rate due to solar
protons.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 351.380, -16.219 degrees, whose radius is 86.229 +/-  0.012
degrees (3 sigma).  This intersects the WXM error box to form an
error box whose coordinates are:

     RA(2000)     DEC(2000)
      71.830      17.934
      71.792      17.969
      71.736      18.204
      71.697      18.238

The combined WXM/IPN error box area is ~24 sq. arcmin., or ~75
times smaller than the WXM-only error box.  A map has been posted
at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/031111.  This error box may be 
improved.
