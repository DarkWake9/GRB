Using the full BAT data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report that trigger #704327 was due to a noise fluctuation in the image domain.
The BAT ground analysis shows the image significance has dropped to 3.2 sigma.
No obvious emission is seen in the mask-weighted light curve.

We have analyzed 607 s of XRT data, from T+116 s to T+723 s.  No source is detected
inside the BAT error circle, down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 2.7E-2 counts/s. 

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field 113 s after the BAT
trigger. No optical afterglow consistent with the BAT position
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.

Therefore, we believe this trigger is due to a noise fluctuation.
