Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the GROND position of the GRB081226a afterglow (GCN 8731) at
4.800 and 4.928 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
between 01:00:00 UT and 22:00:00 UT on February 21/22, 2009.

We did not detect a radio source at the position of the GRB081226a (GCN
8731). The data at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz were merged and the radio flux
density at the GRB optical afterglow position found out to be 0.115 +/-
0.180 mJy/beam (1-sigma).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
