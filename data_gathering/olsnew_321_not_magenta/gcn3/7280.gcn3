Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080210 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 302888) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 345.9s after the GRB trigger
(11.2s after the notice). The elevation of the field was at
from 15 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detect a new fading source in the error box given by SWIFT
We detected the candidate couterpart not present in the DSS
at the following position (+/- 1 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 16h 45m 03.97s
DEC(J2000.0) +13d 49' 35"

OT was R~16.2 at 345.9s after GRB.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 31.6032 lat=+34.1725
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.2 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
