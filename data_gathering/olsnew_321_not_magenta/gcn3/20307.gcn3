F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and V. D'Elia (ASDC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 161220A
78 s after the BAT trigger (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 20302).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(D'Elia et al. GCN Circ. 20302)
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag
white_FC            78          228          147         >20.5
white               78         1012          295         >21.0

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.01 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
