The infrared afterglow candidate to GRB 030115 (GCN 1816, 1818) was observed
at 250 GHz (1.2 mm) with the 117-channel Max-Planck Millimeter
Bolometer (MAMBO) array at the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta
(Spain).

Two observations of 20 minutes each were made starting 2003 January 16,
1:50 UT (22.5 hours after the burst), and January 18, 7:30 UT,
under good and moderate conditions, respectively. The integrated flux
densities derived from these observations are 

  2003 Jan 16.08 UT    0.4 +- 0.9 mJy
  2003 Jan 18.31 UT    2.9 +- 1.6 mJy

A 3-sigma 250 GHz upper flux limit of ~ 3 mJy and 5 mJy is thus
established for the respective epochs.
