L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3998 seconds after the BAT trigger (Hagen et al., GCN Circ.
19684). No credible afterglow candidate has been found in the initial
data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error
circle (Kennea et al., GCN Circ. 19686). The typical 3-sigma upper limit
has been about 19.6 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of
sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been
made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.08.
