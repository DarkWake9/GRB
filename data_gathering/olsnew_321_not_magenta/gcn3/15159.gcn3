FROM:    Ashley Zauderer at CfA  <bevinashley@gmail.com>

B. A. Zauderer, T. Laskar , and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project, "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe" and a
larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the optically bright GRB 130831A
(Hagen et al. GCN 15139; Xu et al. GCN 15142) with the Combined Array for
Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) beginning 2013 September 1.30
(dt = 0.76 d).  At a mean frequency of 90 GHz, in marginal weather
conditions,
we obtain a 3-sigma upper limit of 0.78 mJy.  We thank the CARMA observers
and staff for their support."
