V. D'Elia (SSDC), J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 11:50:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200115A (trigger=949361).  Swift did not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 56.454, +5.613 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 45m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = +05d 36' 46"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 300 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~101 sec after the trigger. 

Due to observations at a higher merit related to the follow-up 
of the GW event S200115j, Swift will not slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. B. Cenko (brad.cenko AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
