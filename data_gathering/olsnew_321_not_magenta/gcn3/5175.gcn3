N. D. Morgan and X. Dai (Ohio State Univ.)

We observed GRB 060526 (GCN 5162, Campana et al. 2006) with MDM-2.4m for 
three epochs.  The afterglow is detected in all three observations.

Using USNO B-1 star as the reference (RA=15:31:18.6, DEC=+00 17 34.9, 
R2MAG=16.35, same one used in GCN5173 Khamitov et al. 2006), we get

Rc = 19.90 @ May 27, 03:33:00 UT
Rc = 19.98 @ May 27, 06:02:00 UT
Rc = 20.11 @ May 27, 09:49:00 UT
