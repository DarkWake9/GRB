Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140719A (trigger #605612)
(Starling, et al., GCN Circ. 16606).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 171.571, -50.115 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  11h 26m 17.1s 
  Dec(J2000) = -50d 06' 55.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-5 s sec, 
peaking at ~T+0 sec, and ending at T+20 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 48 +- 23 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-31.5 to T+16.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.9 +- 0.3.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.3 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+8.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.2 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
