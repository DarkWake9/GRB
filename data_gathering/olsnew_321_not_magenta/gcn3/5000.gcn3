D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 04:16:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060424 (trigger=206773).  Swift was not able to slew to the 
burst due to its proximity to the Sun.  The BAT on-board calculated
location is RA,Dec 7.355, +36.820 {00h 29m 25s, +36d 49' 11"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a small spike on top
of a weak peak starting about T-5 sec to about T+5 sec. 
The peak count rate was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec
after the trigger. 

Because of the Sun observing constraint, there will not be any XRT
or UVOT follow-up observations on this burst for at least 24 days.
