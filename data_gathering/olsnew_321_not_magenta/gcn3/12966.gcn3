We began to observe GRB120219A (Swenso et al. GCN 12964 ) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at 14:32:15 (UT), 127 sec after 
the burst. A serveral white and  R-band were obtained.

After combining 11*300s R-band images, a new marginal source was 
found within the errorbox  of X-ray counterpart  ( Swenso et al. GCN 12964). 
Its coordinates ( RA and Dec ) are  08:39:09.55 51:01:56.5  (J2000)
with an uncertainty of  about 1 arcsecond.
The brightness of the source is estimated to be about 
21.5 +/- 0.3 mag relatively to  USNO B1.0 R2 mag 
at the mean time of 37 min after the burst. 

Further observations and confirmation are encouraged.
