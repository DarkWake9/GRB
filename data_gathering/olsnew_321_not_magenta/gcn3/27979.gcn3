F.E. Marshall (GSFC), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), T. Gregoire (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU),
H. A. Ayala Solares (PSU), D.F. Cowen (PSU), J. DeLaunay (PSU) , D. B. Fox (PSU),
A. Keivani (Columbia U.), F. Krauss (PSU), and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) report:

Swift observed the field of IceCube 200615A (GCN Circ. 27950) between 08:58:51 UT
2020 June 15 and 11:12:28 UT on 2020 June 16. The observations used
7 pointing directions to tile the inner part of the 90% confidence
region for the neutrino event. The results of the XRT observations
were reported by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 27973).

UVOT observed the 7 tiling directions using the U filter
covering a total of ~0.57 deg**2. The UVOT field-of-view is co-aligned
with the XRT's but is smaller than the XRT's.
We analyzed the longest exposure for each direction,
which ranged from 337 s to 363 s. The averge exposure was 348 s.
No uncatalogued point sources were found with a
typical sensitivity limit of 19.0 mag.

We also searched for counterparts to the XRT sources reported by
Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 27973).
Sources 1, 3, 4, and 6 were detected with UVOT and are
also in the Digital Sky Survey.
Source 2 was not detected with UVOT.
Source 9 is near a bright galaxy, which was detected with UVOT.
Sources 5, 7, and 8 are outside the field-of-view of UVOT
for all the observations.
