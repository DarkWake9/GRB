D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg), and S. Schulze (PUC, MCSS) report:

Following the corrected Konus-Wind energy range (Frederiks, GCN 14578), we
recalculated E_iso for GRBs 130505A and 130427A (affected by the same
error in GCN 14487, Frederiks, GCN 14579), finding log E_iso,bol = 54.48
+/- 0.01 and 53.89 +/- 0.002, respectively.

This makes GRB 130505A comparable to GRB 080916C, and still one of the
most energetic GRBs ever discovered, but not the most energetic of all.
