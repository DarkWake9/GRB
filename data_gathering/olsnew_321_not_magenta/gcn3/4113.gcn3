K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the bright GRB 050502b (Falcone et al. GCN 3330)
was observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope.  Ic band
imaging was started at 2005 May 2 10:19:30 UT (54 minutes after the
burst) and 60s exposure was repeated. 

 The optical afterglow (Rich et al. GCN 3338) is not detected in our
frames and the following 3-sigma upper limit is derived for a stacked
image.
