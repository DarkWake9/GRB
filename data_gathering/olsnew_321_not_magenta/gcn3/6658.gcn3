TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6658
SUBJECT: GRB 070724: Pre-Imaging Shows a Source in the XRT Error Circle

J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) notes:

"The JFN color plates from the Digitized Sky Survey show a blue source in
the Northeast portion of the XRT error circle of SHB 070724 (Ziaeepour et
al. GCN 6654; Parsons et al. GCN 6656) at position RA= 01:51:14.05, DEC =
-18:35:39.1 (J2000). The source appears somewhat extended in the
north-south direction; if confirmed with new digital imaging, this would
suggest the source as a prime low redshift star-forming host galaxy
candidate."
