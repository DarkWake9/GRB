We observed the field of GRB 140614B (Page, et al., GCN 16394) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/06 14.28 to 2014/06 14.47 UTC (0.11 to
4.62 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.71 hours exposure
in the r and i bands and 0.30 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with 2MASS,
we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 22.70
  i     > 22.53
  Z     > 21.64
  Y     > 21.08
  J     > 21.04
  H     > 20.51

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
