N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and S. Laha (NASA/UMCP) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 220714B
3628 s after the BAT trigger (Laha et al, GCN Circ. 32393) and
detected a bright afterglow (Marshall & Laha, GCN Circ. 32396).
Marshal and Laha provided the UVOT position of GRB 220714B.
Perhaps due to a bright nearby star in the field, there were some
exposures which were cut short, but in this report we include those
using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf.
Proc. 1358, 373):

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.032 in the direction of
the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
