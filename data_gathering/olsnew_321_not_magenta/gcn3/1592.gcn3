TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1592
SUBJECT: GRB021004, astrometric position
DATE:    02/10/06 19:27:16 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) and S. Levine (USNO) report on behalf
of the USNO GRB team:

We have measured the two high signal/noise Ic images
acquired on the Strand 1.55m astrometric telescope at NOFS
on 021005 UT.  Using 23 UCAC2 stars on each frame,
we derive the following accurate position for the optical
afterglow of GRB021004:

  00:26:54.674  +18:55:41.59  J2000

with approximately 50mas external error in each coordinate.
This is in good agreement with the coordinates given
by Fox, et al. (GCN 1564).
