(Northwestern) report:

"In an archival observation of NGC4242 by the Spitzer Space Telescope on
2012-08-06 (PI: van Zee), we find a point-like source coincident with the
enhanced X-ray position of GRB 200729A (Osborne et al, GCN 28168).
Photometry is complicated by the variable background; preliminary analysis
suggests the object has a flux density of ~ 11 uJy (21.3 AB mag), about 1
mag brighter than the NOT r/z limits (Malesani et al., GCN 28169).

Further analysis is in progress."
