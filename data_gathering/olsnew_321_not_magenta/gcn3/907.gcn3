We have observed the error box of GRB 001212 (GCN #899) on Dec. 15, 2000  
(2.5 days after the GRB) and Dec. 17, 2000 with the 3.5m telescope of the 
German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory. The observations were done with 
the NIR-camera Omega-Prime in the H band. Two adjacent pointings were made 
with the 6.5 arcmin FOV camera, covering about 90% of the error box
(see the image at http://www.aip.de/~jcg/grb001212.html). Conditions were 
non-photometric during the first night.

Photometric calibration of the images was done based on the 2MASS magnitude
of object 2MASS 0649178+362151 having H = (14.45+-0.06) mag (and a USNO R-band
magnitude of 16.1 mag). A comparison of the two epochs of (summed) H-band 
images of GRB 001212 reveals no object in the GRB error box which faded by
more than 0.2 mag down to H = 18.3 mag.

The object mentioned by Mohan et al. (GCN #900) which was reported by
Gizis (GCN #901) to have H = (14.603+-0.083) mag based on the April 1, 1998 
2MASS scan, was measured with H = (14.45+-0.10) mag and H = (14.50+-0.10) mag 
at the two epochs, thus being constant within our measurement errors.

We appreciate the availability of the 2MASS 2nd Incremental catalog at 
IPAC/Caltech.
