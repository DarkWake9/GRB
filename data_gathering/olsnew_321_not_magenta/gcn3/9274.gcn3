D. C.-J. Bock (CARMA), P. Chandra (RMC), D. A. Frail (NRAO), and S. R.
Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of view of GRB 090423 (GCN 9198) with the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) at a frequency of
92.5 GHz at the mean observation time of 2009 April 25, 0440 UT. We do not
detect mm emission either within the Swift-XRT error circle (GCN 9205) or
at the UKIRT K-band position (GCN 9202). The 3-sigma upper limit on the
flux density of GRB afterglow is 0.7 mJy.

We acknowledge excellent support from the staff and observers at CARMA."
