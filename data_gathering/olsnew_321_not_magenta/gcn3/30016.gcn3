The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:56:46 UT on 15 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210515B (trigger 642783411.180128 / 210515623).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 315.2, Dec = 45.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 00m, 45d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 151.0 degrees.
