SUBJECT: GRB 121212A: P60 Observations

S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the Swift (Grupe et al., GCN 14064) and
Integral (Mereghetti et al., GCN 14065) GRB121212A with the robotic
Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations began at 08:06 UT on 12 December
2012 (~ 1.2 hours after the Swift trigger) and were obtained in the r',
i', and z' filters.

At the location of the UVOT (Kuin et al., GCN 14069) and Keck/LRIS (Perley
and Horesh, GCN 14070) afterglow, we identify a faint source in our r' and
i' images.  Using several nearby USNO-B1 point sources for reference, we
measure a magnitude of R = 20.45 +/- 0.19 at this time.
