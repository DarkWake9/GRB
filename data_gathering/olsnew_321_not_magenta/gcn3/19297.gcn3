The short-duration GRB 160408A (Swift, Evans et al. GCN Circ. 19260; 
Fermi-GBM, Roberts et al. GCN Circ. 19265;  INTEGRAL-ACS, Trigger #7441) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 6:25:37.4 on 
8 April 2016.  The burst signal was detected by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T0+6.4 sec, 
peaks at T0+6.5 sec and ends at T0+7.1 sec.  The T90 duration 
measured by the SGM data is 0.38 +- 0.18 sec (40-1000 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
