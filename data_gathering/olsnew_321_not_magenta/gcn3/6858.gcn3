At 06:41:40 UT on October 6, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
triggered on GRB 071006. The burst began just before a preplanned
slew, and no source was found automatically onboard. A source was 
found during later ground analysis, at a location of 
RA, Dec 335.282, -23.154, which is
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 21m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = -23d 09' 14"
with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve shows two small peaks
on top of a gradual rise to a large peak at T+32 sec. The total
duration is about 80 sec. The spectrum appears to be of average
hardness for a long GRB.

Because the burst was detected on the ground, there are no prompt
XRT data. We have requested a TOO to observe this burst on
October 10.
