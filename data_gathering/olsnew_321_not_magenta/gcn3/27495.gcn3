The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 16:57:02.83 UT on 4 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200404A (trigger 607712227 / 200404706). This
trigger was initially classified as a solar flare by the flight software,
but is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 61.93, Dec = 3.27, with a statistical uncertainty of 5.02 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.
