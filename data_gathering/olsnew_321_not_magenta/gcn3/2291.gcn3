TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2291
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030629 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 47336 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 20 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  8.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  8.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 154.011,  29.497 degrees, whose radius is 41.021 +/-  0.073
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
