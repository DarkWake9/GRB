At 14:26:21 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070518 (trigger=279592). Swift slewed immediately to the
burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is  RA, Dec 254.223, +55.297 which 
is   
   RA(J2000) = 16h 56m 54s   
   Dec(J2000) = +55d 17'47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve shows a single
(FRED-like) peak with a duration of about 7 sec. The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 14:27:31 UT, 70 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a variable, uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA, Dec 254.1979, +55.2974 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 56m 47.5s
   Dec(J2000) =  55d 17' 42.5"
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 52 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position,
within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image
was 5.8e-10 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 82 seconds after the BAT trigger.  We
see a fading afterglow located at RA, Dec 254.1986, 55.2951 which is   
  RA(J2000) = 16h 56m 47.7s   
  Dec(J2000) = 55d 17' 42.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1 arcsecond (radius, 90% containment)
with an estimated magnitude of 18. No correction
has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.02.
