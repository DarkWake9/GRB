behalf of the REM/ROSS Team, report:

We observed the field of GRB 060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162) with  
the robotic 60 cm REM telescope located at La Silla ESO Observatory  
(Chile). The GRB was not visible from La Silla at the trigger time  
and REM started acquiring automatically a set of infrared images  
(J,H,K filters) at 23:08:56 UT (about 6.67 hours after the burst)  
when the target became visibile. The integration time was 100s in  
each filter. A second set of images was taken starting at 03:56:19 UT  
with the same observing setting.

The analysis of both dataset do not show any infrared source at the  
position of the optical afterglow (Rykoff et al. GCN 5166, Campana et  
al. GCN 5168) down to the 3-sigma upper limit magnitudes J=16.5,  
H=16.2, K=15.8.

was changed from "16:28:30" to "23:08:56".]
