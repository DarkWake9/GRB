S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 200327A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM Team, GCN Circ. 27458;
AGILE-MCAL detection: Ursi, et al., GCN Circ. 27461)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 607035413), Konus-Wind,
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), AGILE (MCAL), and Swift (BAT)
at about 75408 s UT (20:56:48).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   236.574 (15h 46m 18s)  -4.217 ( -4d 13' 02")
  Corners:
   236.885 (15h 47m 32s)  -2.457 ( -2d 27' 24")
   236.477 (15h 45m 54s)  -5.963 ( -5d 57' 48")
   236.244 (15h 44m 59s)  -5.977 ( -5d 58' 36")
   236.654 (15h 46m 37s)  -2.472 ( -2d 28' 18")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2897 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 3.6 deg (the minimum one is 13.7 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 130 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the 
Fermi-GBM final position (GCN Circ. 27458).

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.

[GCN OPS NOTE(11apr20): Per author's request, "GRB" was added to the Subject-line.
This will make the auto-grouping of same-object Circulars operate better.]
