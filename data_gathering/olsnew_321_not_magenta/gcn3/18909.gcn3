K. D. Alexander (Harvard), T. Laskar (NRAO / UC Berkeley), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 160119A (Marshall et al, GCN 18893) at multiple frequencies
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning 2016 January 20.44
UT (1.31 days after the burst). At a mean frequency of 21.8 GHz, we detect
a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~ 0.13 mJy at

RA = 14:07:41.295 +/- 0.36”
Dec = +20:27:40.04 +/- 0.11”

consistent with the enhanced Swift/XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 18896)
and the optical position (Malesani et al,. GCN 18895). Follow-up
observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
