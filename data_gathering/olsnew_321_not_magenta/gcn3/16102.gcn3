Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140413A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 595616) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 92.3s after the GRB trigger
(16.4s after the notice) probably during the end of
the prompt gamma emission regarding the BAT light curve.
The elevation of the field decreased from 36 degrees
above horizon and weather conditions were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect the GROND OT candidate (Varela et al.
GCNC 16099) with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+92.3s to t0+152.3s : Rlim = 17.0

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+165.6s to t0+195.6s : Rlim = 17.6

We co-added series of exposures:
t0+165.6s to t0+457.5s : Rlim = 19.3
t0+468.3s to t0+ 1362s : Rlim = 19.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
