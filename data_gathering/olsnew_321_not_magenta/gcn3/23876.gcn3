The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2019-02-05 at 21:21:44 UT IceCube issued an alert
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/36142391_132143.amon)
reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of
astrophysical origin. Upon further examination by the IceCube
collaboration, the event was found to clearly *not* be of astrophysical
origin.

This event was a rare case of near-in-time coincident events allowing a
clear background event to pass the contained event selections.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube
realtime-alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
