O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:48:59.84 UT on the 29th of December 2014, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 141229A
(trigger 441546542 / 141229492 ). The GBM on-ground location,
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with the
MAXI/GSC position (Negoro et al. 2014, GCN 17246).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 104 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single FRED-like peak with
a duration (T90) of about 11 seconds (50-300 keV). The time-
averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 to T0+11 seconds is adequately
fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy
cutoff. The power law index is -0.91 +/- 0.08 and the cutoff
energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 275 +/- 31 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.1 +/- 0.4)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.9 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
