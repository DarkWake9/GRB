At 01:10:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070219 (trigger=261132).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 260.198, +69.364 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 20m 48s
   Dec(J2000) = +69d 21' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 01:11:38 UT, 82 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  From ground-based analysis we find a weak source at
RA, Dec (J2000) = 260.190, +69.369 which is
  RA(J2000)  = 17h 20m 45.5s 
  Dec(J2000) = +69d 22' 10.7" 
with an error radius of 5 arcseconds. 
This is 21 arcseconds from the BAT position. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 87 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products at
the BAT or XRT position with a white band 3-sigma upper limit of 19.6
mag. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle and
100% of the XRT error circle. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.035
