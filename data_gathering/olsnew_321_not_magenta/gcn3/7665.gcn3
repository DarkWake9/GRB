At 12:26:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080503 (trigger=310785).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 286.617, +68.778 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 06m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 46' 41"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single spike
structure with a duration of about 0.5 sec, although there may
be further activity during the slew.  The peak count rate
was ~6500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:27:28.1 UT, 74.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
286.62049, 68.79379 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 06m 28.92s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 47' 37.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 57 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
5.56e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005), so we cannot constrain the
redshift at this time using the relation from Grupe et al. (2007). A
summary of the promptly downlinked data is given at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/310785/. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 7.82e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 84 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The 3-sigma upper limit is about 20th mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.06.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
