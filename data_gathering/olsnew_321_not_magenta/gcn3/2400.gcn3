K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at 31404 seconds (GCN
2397).  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 35
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  7.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA, Decl(2000)=
165.760,  19.841 degrees, whose radius is 58.647 +/-  0.036 degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus intersects the Konus-Helicon annulus (GCN 2397) to
form two error boxes, one of which may be eliminated by the Konus
ecliptic latitude response.  The resulting error box has an approximate
area of 30000 sq. arcmin.  Its coordinates are:

                     RA(2000)                   DEC(2000)
ERROR BOX CENTER:   15 h 18 m 17.78 s          25 o 30 ' 06.47 "   
ERROR BOX CORNER1:  15 h 21 m 22.52 s          30 o 16 ' 36.32 "
ERROR BOX CORNER2:  15 h 21 m 00.84 s          30 o 13 ' 06.70 "
ERROR BOX CORNER3:  15 h 15 m 35.22 s          21 o 28 ' 07.05 "
ERROR BOX CORNER4:  15 h 15 m 12.55 s          21 o 23 ' 21.82 "

Only slight improvements to this error box are expected.
