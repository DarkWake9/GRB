and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, V. Pelassa,
and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short GRB 170827B was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 525555489),
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT)
at about 70684 s UT (19:38:04).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Corners:
    55.251 (03h 41m 00s) -21.923 (-21d 55' 22")
    53.829 (03h 35m 19s) -23.046 (-23d 02' 44")
     5.177 (00h 20m 42s) -74.042 (-74d 02' 32")
     7.290 (00h 29m 10s) -72.425 (-72d 25' 28")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 74 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 99.7 deg (the minimum one is 77.2 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 104 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
