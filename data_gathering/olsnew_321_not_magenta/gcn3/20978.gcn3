E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Pozanenko (IKI), V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), P. Minaev 
(IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI), M. Eselevich (ISTP)   report 
on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

Ð¦e followed up the short GRB 170325A (Palmer et al., GCN  20938) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) an ZTSh telescope of 
CrAO observatory. The burst was detected by GBM/Fermi (Bissaldi et al., 
GCN 20940) and also detected as 5.5 sigma non-triggered IBAS event of 
0.1 s duration of SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL (see 
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB170325A/GRB170325_SPI-ACS.png).

We obtained several images in R-filter  on  March 26, March 29, and 
April 1 and cover all 90% error box of the BAT/Fermi (Palmer et al., GCN 
  20938).  We investigated variability of sources in the BAT/Fermi error 
box between the three epochs. One source exhibits marginal fading 
between first and second epochs. Preliminary photometry of the source is 
following

the photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars

J082950.18+203013.8 18.25
J082949.90+203106.9 16.65

Coordinates of the source are  (J2000) 08:29:57.677   +20:30:51.75 with 
uncertainty of  0.7 arcsec in both coordinates. The finding chart can be 
found in

The source is not presented in SDSS-DR9, but clearly visible in 
r(=22.59), i(=22.10) filters, barely visible in u-filter (23.1), and not 
detected in g and z of SDSS images.

We suggest the source is an afterglow and host candidates of the short 
GRB 170325A.
