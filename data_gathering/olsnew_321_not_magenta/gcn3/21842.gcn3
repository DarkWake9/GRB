D. Kaplan (UWM), K. Bannister (CSIRO), on behalf of the VAST collaboration.

Following the reported VLA detection of a radio source (Mooley et al.;
LVC GCN 21814, Corsi et al.; LVC GCN 21815) coincident with the optical
transient SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529) we conducted further
observations of NGC 4993 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at
5.5 and 9 GHz. Observations started at 2017-09-04 22:43:04 UT and ended
at 2017-09-05 10:03:04 UT with approximately 9.5 hours of on-source time.

We did not make a robust detection, although there is marginal emission
at the 4-sigma level, at a position consistent with that reported by
Mooley at al. and Corsi et al. This could be associated with the host
galaxy or the optical transient.

Analysis is ongoing, and subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
