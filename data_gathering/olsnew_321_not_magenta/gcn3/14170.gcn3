J. Gorosabel (IAA/CSIC-UPV/EHU), L. Monteagudo Narvion (IAC), D. Malesani
(DARK/NBI), S. Schulze (PUC, MCSS), report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the GRB 130131B (Siegel et al., GCNC 14159) at the Swift/XRT
location reported in Goad et al. (GCNC 14165) with the 82cm IAC80
telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife, Spain). I-band images
with a total exposure time of 13x250s were taken on Feb 1.0135-1.0832 UT
(5.2-6.8 hours post burst). No object brighter than I~21.2 mag (Vega,
calibrated against USNO B1.0 and not corrected for Galactic Extinction)
was detected inside the XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCNC 14165)."
