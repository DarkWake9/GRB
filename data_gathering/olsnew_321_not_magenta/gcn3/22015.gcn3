A. Horesh (HUJI), D. A. Perley (LJMU), S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report: 

We observed GRB171010A (Omodei et al., GCN 21985) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) under our Fermi  GRB program. The VLA observations were undertaken on 2017 October 13.35 UT. We detected a radio source with a flux of ~1.5 mJy at a central frequency of 10 GHz. The source position is consistent with the position of the reported afterglow (Thorstensen and Halpern, GCN 21987; Izzo and Malesani, GCN 21988; Guidorzi et al., GCN 21991; Malesani et al., GCN 22000; Harita et al., GCN 22001; Breeveld and Siegel, GCN 22004; Watson et al., GCN 22011; Kumar et al., GCN 22012). 

Our observations thus confirm the earlier reports of a radio detection (Horesh et al. GCN 22013; Laskar et al. GCN 22014) and suggest that the radio source has a rising spectrum towards higher frequencies. 

Further VLA observations are planned. 
We thank the VLA staff for scheduling these observations.
