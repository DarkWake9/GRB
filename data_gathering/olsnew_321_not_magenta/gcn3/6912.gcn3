report on behalf of larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071013 (Marshall et al., GCN 6907) using 
the Nordic Optical Telescope. Observations were carried out in the R and 
I filters, with mean integration epochs on Oct 13.867 and 13.894 UT 
(8.65 and 9.30 hr after the GRB).

By comparison with the DSS, we do not detect any obvious candidate 
afterglow down to the DSS limiting magnitude R~20.5.

Further observations are planned.

[GCN OPS NOTE(14oct07): Per author's request, the Fynbo affiliation
was changed from "NOT" to "DARK".]
