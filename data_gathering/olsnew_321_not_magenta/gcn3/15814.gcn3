We report the spectral lag analysis for GRB 140209A (GCN Circ. 15808 & 15812)
based on the BAT data.  Using 4-ms binned light curve, the spectral lag
for the 25-50 keV to 100-350 keV bands is 28 (+10/-7) ms, and +34 (+8/-5) ms
for the 15-25 keV to 50-100 keV bands.  These lag values are consistant with a Long GRB.
Further, the extended emission is both shorter than the typical extended eimssion of a
Short GRB, and its shape is exponential in decay instead of more flat-like.
And lastly, there is pecursor emission.  The lag for the precursor
in the 15-25 keV to 50-100 keV bands is 150 (+36/-30) ms.
