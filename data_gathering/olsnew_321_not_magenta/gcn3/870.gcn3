Alberto Castro-Tirado, IAA-CSIC (Granada) and  LAEFF-INTA (Madrid),
Manuel Alises, CAHA (Almeria),
Jochen Greiner, AIP (Potsdam),
on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

"We have imaged the field of the short/hard GRB 001025B (Hurley et 
al., GCN 865) with the 2.2-m telescope at the German-Spanish Calar
Alto Observatory. Several frames covering about 95% of this low-
galactic latitude (4.4 deg) error box were obtained on Oct 27.85 UT, 
Oct 28.79 UT and Oct 29.78 UT (i.e. 48, 71 and 95 hours after the GRB).
No objects varying by more than 0.3 mag are seen within the error
box down to a limiting magnitude of I = 20.5."

[GCN OPS NOTE (31oct00):  There was a typo in the Circular as originally
distributed.  The "i.e. 24, 71..." phrase was changed to "i.e. 48, 71...".]
