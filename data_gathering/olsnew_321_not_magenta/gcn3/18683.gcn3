Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151210A (trigger #666931)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 18678).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 65.080, -71.225 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 20m 19.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -71d 13' 28.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 60%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several peaks starting at ~T-55 sec,
with the brightest peaks at ~T+14 and ~T+38 sec, and ending at ~T+60sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 94.9 +- 10.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-57.19 to T+48.36 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.82 +- 0.79, 
and Epeak of 49.4 +- 15.3 keV (chi squared 53.7 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+38.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.83 +- 0.15 (chi squared 59.89 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
