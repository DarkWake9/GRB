We report the observation of galaxies in the LVC error region for
 G297595/GW170814 (GCN 21474) The following galaxies were observed as a
part of the ongoing galaxy monitoring program one to two days before or
after the reported time of the event of 2017-08-14 10:30:43 UTC (GCN21474).
The Lee Sang Gak Telescope (LSGT), a 0.43m telescope at the Siding Spring
Observatory, was used for the observation (Im et al. 2015).

NGC 1097

NGC 1309

NGC 1365

NGC 1395

NGC 1672

2MASX J02451334-4627194

LCRS B025857.5-382242

2MASX J03171288-435821

LCRS B031640.4-421205

 No credible transient has been found around these galaxies, except for NGC
1672 where a young supernova, SN 2017gax, is detected in the images taken
on both August 13 and 14, making it not associated with G297595/GW170814.
