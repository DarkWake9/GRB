Swift has gathered 5.8 ks of WT mode data and 463 s of PC mode data on 
the field of the BAT trigger 700791 (= possible GRB 160622A, GCN 19547).

The XRT image is dominated by diffuse emission from the supernova 
remnant RCW 103 (Frank et al., ApJ, 2015, 810,113), with a bright 
central source at RA,Dec. = 244.40282,  -51.03916,  which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000.0) = 16h 17m 36.68s
Dec (J2000.0) = -51d 02' 21.0"

with an uncertainty of 3.5" (radius, 90% confidence). This is consistent 
with the catalogued X-ray source 3XMM J161736.1-510224. Analysis is 
complicated by the presence of the diffuse emission from the SNR, 
however the source count rate is ~2 ct/sec, with a flux of approximately 
9.1 (+2.0, -1.6) Ã— 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (derived from a power-law 
spectrum with NH=7.0 (+3.6, -2.5)e21 cm^-2, and a photon index of 2.2 
(+/- 0.4). This is substantially above the 3XMM count rate of 2.567 (+/- 
0.020)e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Observations and analysis are ongoing.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT team.

and the missing minus sign for the sexagesimal form of the Dec value
was added.]
