We have already reported the observation of the optical transient GRB 
180809B (Moss et al., GCN # 23105) by one of the telescopes of the MASTER 
Global Network (Lipunov et al., GCN 23109).

Here we report on the triple independent, automatic detection of the 
optical transient (also found by Swift UVOT (Moss et al., GCN 23105)). The 
relatively later guidance of the three MASTER robotic telescopes is due to 
the fact that the first socket message did not indicate the time of the 
trigger. As a result, everyone went to the CALET Alert (trig 
number 1217881726) with poor defined coordinates. 
Nevertheless, we were able to obtain detailed light curves 
with a maximum in 4 polarizations.


MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, 
Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L) located in 
South Africa (South African Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the 
GRB180809.85 16 sec after notice time and 111 sec after trigger time at 
2018-08-09 20:30:39 UT. On our 1-th (10s exposure)  set in two 
polarizations (/\), obtained 111 
sec after tigger time at 2018-08-09 20:30:39 UT, we  found 1 optical transient 
within SWIFT error-box (ra=299.7 dec=-15.2989 r=0.05) brighter then 17.4.

The observations started on zenit distance = 21 deg., galactic latitude b 
= -22 deg. The moon ( 4 % bright part) was below the horizon (The altitude 
of the  Moon = -75 deg ). The sun  altitude  = -56.3 degree. The object 
can be observed till 2018-08-10 04:03:58 UT.
