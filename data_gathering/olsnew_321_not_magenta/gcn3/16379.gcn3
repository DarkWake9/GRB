The long GRB 140610A (Swift-BAT trigger #601259:
Evans et al., GCN 16375; T0(BAT)=16:31:29 UT)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The light curve shows a broad emission pulse which started
~3 s before the BAT trigger, peaked at ~T0(BAT)+3 s,
and lasted till ~T0(BAT)+150 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140610A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(1.6 ± 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak energy flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+3 s, of (2.3 ± 0.3)x10^-7 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 - 10000 keV energy range).

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0(BAT)-3 s to T0(BAT)+150 s) by a power law
with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.75 ± 0.15, and Ep = 200 ± 93 keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
