Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of the outburst from SGR 1806-20 (trigger #549841)
(Burrows, et al., GCN Circ. 14251).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 272.158, -20.399 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 08m 38.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 23' 58.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a symmetrical peak with a total width 
of about 100 msec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.05 +- 0.01 sec (estimated error
including systematics).  There is no evidence of additional outbursts
in the post 180 sec of the lightcurve at the 0.2 ph/cm2/sec 3-sigma upper limit.
 
Several models are fit over a time-averaged spectrum from T-0.02 to T+0.04 sec.
A simple power-law model shows the power law index of 2.43 +- 0.24 (chi squared
49.55 for 57 d.o.f.).  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.49 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
A single blackbody fit to the time-averaged spectrum shows the blackbody
temperature of 8.24 +- 1.19 keV (chi squared 54.15 for 57 d.o.f.).
A thermal bremsstrahlung model fit shows the temperature of 37.64 +- 11.54 keV
(chi squared 45.71 for 57 d.o.f.).
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
