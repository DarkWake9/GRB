E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)
observed this GRB at 56599 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 4 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately 2E-07 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  2E-07
erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with
approximate area 40000 square arcminutes whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  19 h 50 m 39.16 s    -44 o 20 '   2.33 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 19 h 52 m 33.12 s    -45 o 33 '  16.65 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 20 h  9 m 57.61 s    -52 o  1 '  52.28 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 19 h 42 m  1.51 s    -36 o  9 '  33.02 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 19 h 48 m 59.33 s    -43 o  6 '  18.58 " 

This error box may be improved, but as the Earth, Mars, and Ulysses are
practically aligned, a small error box cannot be derived for this
event.
