DATE:    13/05/14 21:49:31 GMT
FROM:    Ulisse Quadri at Bassano Bresciano Obs  <oabb@ulisse.bs.it>

U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130513A (INTEGRAL trigger 6842; Mereghetti et
al., GCN 14630)  with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) 
Bassano Bresciano Observatory, Italy.

The observations started (after the dusk) 12h 19m after the 
GRB trigger, with our Schmidt telescope D=400 mm F/D=3 

Weather conditions were very good.

We co-added 2 series of 10 unfiltered CCD exposures of 120s each.

We did not found any optical counterpart in the 
Swift-XRT error circle (Evans & Marshall, GCN
Circular 14635) at our following limiting magnitude:
.

Magnitudes were estimated with the USNO-B1 cat. 
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
