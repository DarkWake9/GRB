S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU),
H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC),
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 20:27:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located the new source SWIFT J174540.2-290037 (trigger=690197).  Swift did not slew
due an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 266.391, -28.980, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 45m 34s
   Dec(J2000) = -28d 58' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time TDRSS
data does not show anything significant. 

This source is presumably the same as the source that triggered 
2.5 days earlier (Barthelmy et al., GCN 19499) and then again earlier today 
(Barthelmy et al., GCN 19514).  This is most likely
the recently-detected source SWIFT J174540.2-290037, which
has continued to brighten in the XRT during routine monitoring
(Degenaar et al. Atel #9109).   XRT and UVOT data for this trigger are 
expected at around 22:00 UT.
