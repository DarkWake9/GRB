The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:08:04 UT on 28 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191028B (trigger 593964489.441812 / 191028589).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 276.9, Dec = 70.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 27m, 70d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
