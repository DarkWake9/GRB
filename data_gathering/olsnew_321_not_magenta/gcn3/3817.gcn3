The Swift Ultra-Violet Telescope (UVOT) began observations of GRB050815 on 
August 15th, 2005 at 17:26:25.6 UT, 67s after the BAT trigger. The UVOT 
took a 100s exposure in the V band and two 10s exposures in the M1 and W2 
UV filters before the source was occulted by the Earth. The next set of 
observations were made ~1hr after the BAT trigger.

band at position

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5". Astrometry was performed using 
stars from the USNO-catalogue. The source is no longer detected in the 
second epoch of V band images, confirming it's fading nature, and leading 
us to conclude this to be the afterglow. No detections are made in any 
other of the UVOT filters at the 3-sigma significance level. 

Photometry carried out on this source requires additional care due to the 
proximity ofvarious bright stars (~16-18mag). We estimate the afterglow to 
have decayed by about 1 magnitude in 1 hour. Further analysis is still
undergoing.
