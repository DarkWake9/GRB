Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP),
Boer M., Siellez K., Dereli H., Bardho O. (UNS-CNRS-OCA),
Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130610A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 557845) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 91s after the GRB trigger
(17s after the notice). The elevation of the field
decreased from 31 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We recorded the rise of the afterglow discovered by
Melandri et al. (GCNC 14843).

We used the star NOMAD1 1182-0257977 R.A.=224.3892908
DEC=+28.2065917 R=14.11 to extract the light curve
of the rise of the afterglow:

start end     Rmag
(sec) (sec)
   91   97   > 17.8
   97  103   > 17.8
  103  109   > 17.8
  109  115   > 17.8
  115  121   > 17.8
  121  127     17.7
  127  133     16.9
  133  139     16.5
  139  145     16.6
  145  151     16.1

Magnitudes are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

After the trailed image a technical problem prevented
to obtain next images.
