At 5.9 h after  INTEGRAL alert   MASTER robotic telescope
(GCN 2672 Refined position) had imaging  the corresponding area of the
sky under the large zenit distance and bad weather condition.
The first image was started at 17h41m25s UT.

We have 25 unfiltered images of the error box (30s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin, 200 mm camera).

The unfiltered optical limit on sum is  17 m .

Possible optical transient inside error box:

alpha = 15 17 08
delta = -16 09 00
m = 15+-0.5
error =+-5"

Sum FITS image  are available at
