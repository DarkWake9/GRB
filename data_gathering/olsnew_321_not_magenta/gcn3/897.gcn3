K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, F. Frontera, C. Guidorzi, and E.
Montanari, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, and E. Mazets and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

We have now completed several consistency checks for the IPN position
of GRB001204 (GCN 895), including

1. Deriving the ecliptic latitude of the event using the Konus-WIND data, 

2. Deriving the possible arrival directions using the BeppoSAX GRBM data, 

3. Eliminating one possible IPN position using BeppoSAX Earth-blocking, and

4. Deriving an annulus by comparing the BeppoSAX GRBM and Konus-WIND data
(the two data sets with the best time resolution and signal-to-noise ratios).

As all of the results are consistent with the position given in GCN 895,
we conclude that this is indeed the correct error box for this event, despite
the somewhat marginal detection by Ulysses.
