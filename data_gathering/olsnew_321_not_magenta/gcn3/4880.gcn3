B. Schmidt and D. Bayliss (ANU), on behalf of a larger collaboration 
report,

"We have obtained a series of R-band images with 40inch telescope + WFI 
starting at UT Mar 13.358 of GRB 060313 (Pagani et al. GCN 4867) of the 
OT-candidate of Levan and Hjorth (GCN 4871).
Comparison of the image with those taken with Gemini-S (Schmidt et al. 
GCN 4876)
shows the OT-candidate has faded by at least 0.4 magnitudes (95% 
confidence). 
Although not detected, using  the  USNOA2 star located at
    RA=04:26:28.906 DEC=-10:51:00.16 (J2000)     R=18.1
as a reference, we estimate the OT to be fainter than R=20.5 (95% 
confidence). This variability confirms the association of the OT with 
GRB060313."
