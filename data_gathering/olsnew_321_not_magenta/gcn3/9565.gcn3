We observed the field of GRB 090621B detected by Swift 
(trigger #355359; Curran et al., GCN #9545) with the 14-inch 
Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT) located at the Goddard Geophysical 
and Astronomical Observatory (http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).   

100 set of 30 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting 
from June 22 01:51:44 (UT) about 3.7 hours after the trigger and 
stopped on June 22 02:47:51 (UT).  We do not detect the optical 
afterglow both in the individual images and the combined image 
inside the XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN #9550).  The 
estimated three sigma upper limit of the combined image (total 
exposure of 2880 sec; excluding four bad quality images) is 
~17.8 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
