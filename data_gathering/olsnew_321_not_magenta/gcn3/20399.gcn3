and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) was operating at the trigger time
of G268556 (GCN Circ. 20364).  No CGBM on-board trigger occurred at the time
of the event.  Based on the LIGO BAYESTAR localization sky map, the southern arc
of the high probability area was in the field-of-view of CGBM.  The summed LIGO
probabilities inside the HXM and the SGM field of view are 37% and 40%.

Based on the analysis of the light curve data with 0.125 sec time resolution
from -60 sec to 60 sec from the trigger time, we found no significant excess
around the trigger time in either the HXM (7-1000 keV) or the SGM (0.1-20 MeV)
data.

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger mode at the trigger
time of G268556.  Using CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events above
10 GeV from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates.
The summed LIGO probabilities inside the CAL field of view is ~30%, which
is largely overlapping with the HXM's FOV.
