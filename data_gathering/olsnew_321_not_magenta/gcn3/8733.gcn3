E. Berger (Harvard), A. Cucchiara, and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report:

"We obtained spectroscopic observations of the possible afterglow of GRB
081226 (GCNs 8731, 8732) with GMOS on the Gemini-South telescope using the
R400 grating with a central wavelength of 6000A for a total of 2400 sec.
We detect smooth continuum emission but no obvious absorption or emission
features in the wavelength range 4000-8000A.  Further analysis is
on-going."
