report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 1751 observations, covering 1408
separate locations within the LVC error region for the GW trigger
G275697 convolved with the 2MPZ catalogue, using the 'bayestar' GW
localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap, galaxy distances were taken
into account in selecting which ones to observe. The observations
currently span from 15 ks to 534 ks after the LVC trigger, and cover
171 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for overlaps). This covers 0.16 of
the probability in the LVC skymap, and 0.31 of the probability in the
LVC map after convolving with the 2MPZ galaxy catalogue, as described
by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,	462, 1591).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected 31 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 12 sources of rank 3
  * 19 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7


RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.

compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.
