The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 13:24:08.42 UT on 23 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220523B (trigger 675005053 / 220523558).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is
RA = 104.31, Dec = 59.72 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 57m, 59d 43'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 1.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 124 degrees.
