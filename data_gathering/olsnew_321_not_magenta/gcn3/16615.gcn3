Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140719B (trigger #605700)
(Starling, et al., GCN Circ. 16609).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 39.731, -2.384 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 38m 55.4s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 23' 03.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 42%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-18 s sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+60 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 53.0 +- 13.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-17 to T+49 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.8 +- 0.2.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-4.97 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
