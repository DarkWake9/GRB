S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC, UCL-MSSL) reports on behalf of the UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of GRB 151112A, 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3144 seconds after the BAT trigger (Malesani et al., GCN Circ. 18588). No 
credible afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7’ 
sub-image covers none of the XRT error circle (Burrows et al., GCN Circ. 18589). The 
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. 
The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.01.
