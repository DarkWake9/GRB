(IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de 
Malaga), R. P. Hedrosa and I. Hermelo (CAHA) on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

Following the detection of the short-soft event GRB 190326A by Swift 
(Siegel et al. GCNC 24009), we triggered the 2.2m telescope (+CAFOS) at 
the Spanish Calar Alto Observatory (Almeria, Spain). Observations were 
conducted at high airmass starting on March 28, 04:22:52 UT (i.e. 1.87 
day after the trigger). A series of BVRI imaging (500s per filter) shows 
no optical afterglow down to 21 mag (in the calibrated R-band image) 
within the Swift/BAT error box (1.6 arcmin, Markwardt et al. GCNC 24020).

We acknowledge excellent support from the CAHA staff.
