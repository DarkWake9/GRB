Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191213A (trigger #944091)
(Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 26398).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 224.530, -9.745 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 58m 07.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 44' 41.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 56%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows some weak emission that starts at ~T-30
s
and remains detectable until the burst went out of the BAT FOV at T+139 s.
It is likely that the emission continues beyond T+139 s. The burst did not
come
back into the BAT FOV within the next ~ 2 hours.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-33.52 to T+104.01 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+99.95 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
