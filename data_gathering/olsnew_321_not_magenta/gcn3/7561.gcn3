GRB080330: Improved Swift XRT Position

J. Mao (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Since the spacecraft began slowly drifting because the star tracker did 
not lock properly on the star field, the XRT position for GRB 080330 
that was distributed in GCN Circ. 7537 (Mao et al.) was incorrect. The 
initial on-borad XRT position determined immediately after the 
spacecraft slew was given by D. N. Burrows (GCN Circ. 7541). The final 
accurate XRT position from download data of Malindi is:

RA=169.2584d {11h 17m 02.02s} (J2000)

Dec=30.6229d{+30d 37' 22.58"} (J2000)
 
with the error radius 3.62 arcsec.
