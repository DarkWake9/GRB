D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), C.-M. Zhang, C. Cao, S.-M. Hu (SDU) report:

We observed the field of GRB 151027A (Maselli et al., GCN 18478) using 
the 1m telescope located at Weihai, Shandong, China. Observations 
started at 09:44 UT on 2015-07-27, i.e., 5.77 hr after the burst. We 
obtained 5x300s R-band and 5x150s I-band frames.

The afterglow (e.g., Maselli et al., GCN 18478; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 
18479; Elenin et al., GCN 18480; Perley & Cenko, GCN 18481) is clearly 
detected in each image, and it has decayed to m(R) = 16.0 +/- 0.1 mag 
for the first R-band exposure, calibrated with the nearby USNO B1 stars 
(with R2 magnitudes).
