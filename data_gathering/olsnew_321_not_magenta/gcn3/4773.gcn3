  M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL), D. Morris (PSU) and P. Roming (PSU)
on the behalf of the Swift UVOT/team:

  The Swift/UVOT began taking data on the field of GRB 060213
at 13:35:41 UT on 2006-02-15, 48.41 hours after the GRB
(Pal'shin et al. GCN 4762).

The UVOT field does not cover the whole IPN error box, but it
encompasses the field of the uncatalogued source detected
by the XRT (Morris et al. GCN 4770). No optical afterglow
candidate is detected in the summed images of each of the
UVOT filters down to the following 3-sigma magnitude
upper limits:

Filter     T_range (sec)    Exp(sec)           3 sigma u.l.

  V        180203 - 187038     1020                 20.1
