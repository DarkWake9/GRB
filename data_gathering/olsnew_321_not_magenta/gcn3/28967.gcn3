We observed the field of the Fermi/GBM likely short GRB 201130A (Fermi GBM Team,
GCN Circ. 28965) with the DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx)
from 2020-11-30 07:56 UTC to 13:09 UTC (from 2.4 to 7.7 hours after the trigger)

We observed a region covering 20.4 degrees in RA and 20.4 degrees in declination
(about 416 square degrees) centered on 10:28:57.60 +31:59:24.0 (J2000). We
obtained between 1020 and 1620 seconds exposure in the w filter. We calibrated
our images against the APASS catalog. Our 10-sigma limiting magnitudes vary from
w = 17.8 to 19.3.

Compared to the USNO-B1, DSS DR2 and Pan-STARRS DR1 catalogs, we detect no
uncataloged sources to our 10-sigma limit.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
