TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 160220B: Further GROND Observations
DATE:    16/02/22 14:04:03 GMT
FROM:    Philip Wiseman at MPE/Swift  <wiseman@mpe.mpg.de>

P. Wiseman, J. Bolmer and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf 
of the GROND team:

We once again observed the field of GRB 160220B (Swift trigger 674734; 
Cummings et al., GCN #19029) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND 
(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPG telescope 
at ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Based on 36.00 min of total exposures in r', at a mid-time of 08:55 UT 
on 2016-02-22, ~1.9 days after the trigger, we do not detect any fading 
in the source reported by Wiseman et al. (GCN #19042), placing a limit 
on any magnitude change to < 0.1 mag in 24 hrs, in agreement with UVOT 
observations ( De Pasquale et al., GCN #19051).

We therefore agree that this source is likely not the afterglow of GRB 
160220B.
