K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, 

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau,
on behalf of the INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) team, report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 55859 seconds.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 40 seconds, a 25-100 keV 
fluence of approximately  9.4E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  8.1E-07
erg/cm2 s over  .50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA, Decl(2000)=
331.788, -34.484 degrees, whose radius is 61.851 +/-   .073 degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was not 
observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
