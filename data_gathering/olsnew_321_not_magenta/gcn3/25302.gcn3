On behalf of the DESGW collaboration*



We report five new candidate counterparts to the LIGO/Virgo binary black hole merger S190728q (LVC, GCN No. 25187) found by our target of opportunity program, and provide additional photometry on one candidate discovered by GROWTH (PIs: Andreoni & Goldstein, GCN No. 25215).


DESGW observed 108 square degrees, covering 81% of the LALInference localization probability (LVC, CGN No. 25208) to 23rd r-band magnitude in five epochs distributed within one week from the time of merger:

4 5.419 20190801

5 7.411 20190803


Images were processed by our difference imaging pipeline (Herner et al. 2017; see also Soares-Santos et al. 2015, 2017; Doctor et al. 2018; Morgan et al. 2019 for recent applications) using publicly available DECam images as templates. We employ a machine learning code (autoscan, Goldstein et al. 2015) to reject subtraction artifacts. Candidates were initially selected by requiring at least two high signal to noise detections on any two nights, rejecting asteroids. We then applied catalog-based vetting to reject variable stars, variable AGNs, and candidates with hosts at redshifts inconsistent with the distance reported by the LVC for S190728q (874 +/- 171 Mpc). Those catalogs included Gaia DR2, SDSS DR15, and DECaLS DR8. The final vetting was done via visual inspection. We matched our remaining candidates using the Transient Name Server to avoid reporting those previously reported by other groups. In our final sample, we find 5 new candidates that show a significant (2 sigma) decrease in flux. This requirement is motivated by the fact that our primary contaminant, supernovae, typically vary in timescales that are much longer than one week. The five candidates that meet all of our criteria are:

We also checked for increasing flux at the same significance level and found no additional candidates.


The host galaxy redshift is available for desgw-190728b and is marginally consistent with the LVC estimate of distance to the merger. Candidate desgw-190728e has a clear host without redshift information. The other three candidates appear to be hostless.

We did detect all of the nine candidates previously reported by GROWTH (Goldstein et al., GCN 25215). Two of them met our selection criteria: 2019lvy and 2019lvu. The former we exclude due to a pre-merger detection in ZTF. We provide additional photometry for their remaining candidate:

All magnitudes reported are observed magnitudes. We encourage spectroscopic followup of these candidates.


Data processing of images from all five epochs has concluded and a detailed analysis is ongoing. We expect to report updates soon.


The DECam Search & Discovery Program for Optical Signatures of Gravitational Wave Events (DESGW) is carried out by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration in partnership with wide ranging groups in the community. DESGW uses data obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), which was constructed by the DES collaboration with support from the Department of Energy and member institutions, and utilizes data as distributed by the Science Data Archive at NOAO. NOAO is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
