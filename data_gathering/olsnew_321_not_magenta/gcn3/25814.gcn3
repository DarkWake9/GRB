SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S190923y: Identification of a GW compact binary merger candidate

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S190923y during real-time
processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston
Observatory (L1) at 2019-09-23 12:55:59.646 UTC (GPS time: 1253278577.646).
The candidate was found by the PyCBC Live [1], MBTAOnline [2], and GstLAL
[3] analysis pipelines.

S190923y is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated
by the online analysis, is 4.8e-08 Hz, or about one in 7 months. The
event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190923y

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is
NSBH (68%), Terrestrial (32%), BNS (<1%), BBH (<1%), or MassGap (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong evidence
for the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar masses (HasNS:
>99%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, there is strong
evidence against matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant: <1%).

One sky map is available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB
event page:
* bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR [4],
distributed via GCN notice about 6 minutes after the candidate

For the bayestar.fits.gz sky map, the 90% credible region is 2107 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 438 +/- 133 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

The Virgo (V1) detector was not in observing mode at the time of the
candidate but was collecting low-noise data during a tuning of the
interferometer working point.  We are investigating whether the V1 data can
be used in parameter estimation analyses.
