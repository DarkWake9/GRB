L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:38:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081017 (trigger=331964).  This was too close to the Sun
for Swift to slew to.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 230.180, -32.815 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 20m 43s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 48' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, the immediately
available BAT light curve shows no obvious variation. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is O. Godet (og19 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
