K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the HETE-2 GRB 051022 (Trigger number 3950)
was observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope. VRcIc
imaging started at 2005 October 22, 13:09:49 UT (111s after the
trigger) and 60s integration was repeated.

 Preliminary analysis of a part of the data does not show a new object
brighter than R~15.8 within the 5' diameter SXC error region (GCN
alert sequence number 10). Further observations and analyses are in
progress.
