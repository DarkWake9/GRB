P.A.Milne (Steward Obs) and A. Updike report on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS GRB team:
 
We observed the field of GRB 080315 starting at UT=02:43:58
(~19min since GRB) with the 2.3m Bok telescope at Kitt Peak, AZ.
We obtained 23 x 60-sec and 7 x 120-sec images in the R-band filter.
 
We do not detect emission at the location of the faint XRT source
(Palmer et al., GCN 7416) to a limiting magnitude of R~23.5.
 
We do not detect any sources other than ones apparent in the DSS,
to the limit of the DSS image. We do not detect a fading/rising source
between the initial 10 and final 10 images.
