The localization of Fermi GBM trigger 468620696 / GRB 151107B (Stanbro et al,
GCN Circ. 18570) has been observed by Mini-MegaTORTORA nine-channel wide-field
monitoring system (located at Special Astrophysical Observatory near Russian
6-m telescope and belonging to Kazan Federal University) before, during and
after the trigger time at 2015-11-07 20:24:52.30 UT. The whole final 1-sigma
localization box (as well as 6 more degrees around it) has been covered since
20:19:23 UT (T-329.3 s) and until 20:25:18 UT (T+25.7 s, thus covering the
brightest part of first gamma-ray peak) with temporal resolution of 0.1 s in
white light. Dedicated real-time transient detection pipeline did not detect
any events longer than 0.3 s and brighter than approximately V=10.5 mag. Visual
inspection of co-added images with 10 s effective exposure (summation of 100
consecutive frames each) has not revealed any variable source down to V=12.0
mag during that interval.

At 20:25:18 UT the system initiated a repointing following the initially
distributed GBM coordinates, and since 20:25:55 UT (T+62.7 s, during the
continuing gamma-ray activity) till 20:35:59 UT (T+666.7 s) acquired 20x9 deep
images with 30 s exposures in white light in a 30x30 degree field of view
centered on RA=24.1 Dec=44.8. The whole final 1-sigma localization was still
inside the field of view. Quick-look analysis of the acquired data has not
revealed any variable object down to roughly V=13.5 mag over that time interval.

The analysis is ongoing.
