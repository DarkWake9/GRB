We observed part of the skymap of the avanced LIGO and Virgo trigger G184098, with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at ESO-Paranal equipped with OMEGACAM
(FOV=1 square degree). The observations were taken in the r-sloan band and started at 2015-09-17T06:26:25.645 UT.
The coverd area  was ~ 54 square degrees divided in 6 pointings of 9 square degrees and 80 sec exptime each.
The 3 x 3 deg pointings are centered on the following coordinates RA, Dec (J2000):
05:22:57 -67:30:00; 05:58:00 -70:43:48; 06:34:45 -70:43:48; 07:47:40 -70:38:24; 08:05:57 -67:31:12; 08:38:40 -67:31:12

The image anaysis is ongoing. Further observations of these fields plus four new fields near these pointings are planned for this night.
