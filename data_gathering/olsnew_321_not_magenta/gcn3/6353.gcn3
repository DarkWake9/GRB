E. Rol, N. Tanvir (U. of Leicester), R. Smith (Liverpool JMU), report
for a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB070412 (Romano, GCN Circ. 6273) in r'
and i' bands with the 2m Liverpool Telescope at several epochs. At the
position  of the  X-ray afterglow (Romano, GCN Circ. 6282),  we do not
detect any new sources.  Our  photometry is calibrated relative to the
SDSS (Adelman-McCarthy et  al., 2007 ApJS in press),  and our limiting
magnitudes at the observed epochs are as follows:

Since the  upper limits  indicate no apparent  supernova at  the X-ray
position, the  GRB position  is either a  chance coincidence  with the
nearby bright galaxy (CGCG 215-024; see also Ofek, GCN Circ. 6275), or
belongs to the  newly suggested class of long-duration  GRBs that show
no associated supernovae  (Fynbo et al. 2006, Nature  444, 1047; Della
Valle et al. 2006, Nature 444,  1050; Gal-Yam et al. 2006, Nature 444,
1053).  For comparison,  the expected  magnitudes at  13.9 days  for a
SN1998bw-like supernova at the  redshift of the galaxy (z=0.0307), are
r' = 17.3 and i' = 17.6.
