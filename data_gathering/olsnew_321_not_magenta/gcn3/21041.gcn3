N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) reports:

I note that the MASTER optical transient reported by 
Lipunov et al. (GCN 21040) coincides with an AGN
for which SDSS gives a magnitude of r=16.1 (consistent
with the MASTER source) and a redshift of z=0.101.
This suggests there is no compelling reason for it to be 
associated with Swift trigger 750096.
