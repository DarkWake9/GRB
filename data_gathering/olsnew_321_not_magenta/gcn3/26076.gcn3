The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:23:44 UT on 26 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191026A (trigger 593771029.458568 / 191026350).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 37.2, Dec = -52.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 28m, -52d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 114.0 degrees.
