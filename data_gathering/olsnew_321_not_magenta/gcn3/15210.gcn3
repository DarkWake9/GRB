SUBJECT: GRB 120419A: Swift XRT confirmation of the afterglow
DATE:    13/09/11 08:38:22 GMT
FROM:    Rhaana Starling at U of Leicester  <rlcs1@star.le.ac.uk>

R.L.C. Starling and K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

Swift performed a further pointing of INTEGRAL-detected burst GRB 120419A 
(Gotz et al., GCN Circ. 13241), on 10th September 2013 for a total exposure of 3.9 ks.

No source is detected at the position of the X-ray source previously localised with XRT
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 13242). We measure an upper limit on the count rate of 2.4e-3 
count s^-1. The source has therefore faded and we confirm this as the X-ray afterglow 
of GRB 120419A.
