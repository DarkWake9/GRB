We have analysed the first orbit of XRT data from GRB 060510A.
A 1.8ks Photon Counting (PC) mode image provides a refined XRT position:

RA(J2000) =  06 23 28.0
Dec(J2000)=  -01 09 44.2

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (90% containment).
This position is 1.3 arcsec away from the ground-calculated XRT position 
quoted in Krimm et al. (GCN 5095), 15.2 arcseconds from the BAT position
(GCN 5095) and it is consistent with the UVOT position given in GCN 5095.

A power-law fit of the PC spectrum with a column density fixed to the
Galactic one (4.1 e21 cm^-2) gives a photon index of 2.1+/-0.5.
The 0.2-10.0 keV observed flux is 2.0E-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1, which
corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 3.2E-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

The light curve shows a fast initial decay, followed by a flattening
phase. At about 1.2 ks from the trigger, it starts to decay again.

Further osbervations are ongoing.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
