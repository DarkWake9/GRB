(IKI)  report on behalf of  larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

Following trigger Swift #558631 (Barlow et al., GCN 14917) we imaged the 
region of the trigger with   starting on June 21 (UT) 19:54:46. We 
obtained 50 unfiltered images of 50 s exposure. We investigated  a 
combined image (mid time after the Swift trigger 0.75693 days) and 
within BAT error circle (Barlow et al., GCN 14917) found one bright 
source which is not catalogued in USNO-B1.0 but barely visible in DSS2 
Red image. Coordinates of the source is (J2000) 18:07:13.13 -22:17:14.4. 
It is apparent that the source is not coincident with known X-ray source 
SAX_J1806.5-221. Brightness of the source is 17.09 +/- 0.03 calibrating 
against nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2).

At present time it is not clear if the source is related to the Swift 
#558631 trigger. The source also can be a new cataclysmic variable with 
magnitude of the outburst of ~3m.
