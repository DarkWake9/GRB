I.A. Smith (Rice U.), D.A. Perley (LJMU), and N.R. Tanvir 
(U. of Leicester) report:

We observed the Swift UVOT location of GRB 210104A (Troja 
et al., GCN Circ. 29233) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter 
continuum camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The 
observation started at 08:23 UT on 2021-01-05, with the 
mid-point of the run at 0.894 days after the burst trigger.  
Exposures totaling 1.0 hours were made in very good weather 
conditions.  No source was detected, with the RMS background 
noise being 1.7 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 14.5 mJy/beam 
at 450 microns.

We thank Kevin Silva, Mark Rawlings, and the JCMT staff for 
the prompt support of these observations that were taken under 
project M20BP026.
