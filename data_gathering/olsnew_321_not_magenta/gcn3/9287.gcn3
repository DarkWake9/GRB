TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  9287
SUBJECT: GRB 090429A - Correction to XRT position
DATE:    09/04/29 11:35:56 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The onboard XRT position for GRB 090429A (Markwardt et al. GCN. Circ 
9280) delivered as an XRT position notice and given in GCN 9280 was 
incorrect. Inspection of the images reveals a cosmic ray 52 arcsec from 
the GRB which affected the onboard centroid.

The correct position of the XRT afterglow is: RA, Dec= 90.5568, -52.3886
which is equivalent to:

RA(J2000)  = 06 02 13.63
Dec(J2000) = -52 23 18.9

with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
