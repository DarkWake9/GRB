At 00:21:27 on March 24, 2010, Swift-BAT detected a rate increase.  The
source was found onboard, but not at sufficient significance to trigger
an automated GRB followup response.  A significant source was found in
ground analysis at RA, Dec 98.612, -9.735, which is:

RA (J2000)    06h 34m 26.8s
Dec (J2000)   -9d 44' 6.4"

with an estimated uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (radius, 90% containment).

The burst had multiple peaks with a T90 of about 6 seconds.

The spectrum of the burst is best fit with a simple powerlaw with a
rather soft index of 2.4 +- 0.3.  The fluence in the range 15-150 keV
was 7 +- 3 x 10^-8 erg/cm^2 (68% confidence).  The 1-second peak flux
from T-0.3 sec was 0.3 +- 0.1 photons/cm^2.

Because the burst was not triggered onboard, there are no automated
data products.  A Swift TOO has been requested.
