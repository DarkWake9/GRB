TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5342
SUBJECT: GRB 060719: Continued LCO optical observations 
DATE:    06/07/19 08:16:38 GMT
FROM:    Edo Berger at Carnegie Obs  <eberger@ociw.edu>

E. Berger (OCIW) and A. Bonanos (CIW) report:

"Additional imaging observations obtained with the LCO 40-inch telescope
on 07:16:50 UT (26 min) and 07:28:56 UT (38 min) indicate that the optical
candidate in GCN 5340 did not change in brightness by more than 0.2 mag.  
This suggests a fading rate shallower than t^-0.5 if it is the afterglow,
or that this object is the host galaxy or altogether unrelated to the
GRB."
