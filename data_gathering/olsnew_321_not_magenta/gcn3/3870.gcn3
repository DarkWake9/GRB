       MASTER (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB 050824 (Swift trigger 
151905) (see GCN3869). The first image  was 764 sec after
SWIFT  GRB050824 detection    under the    not very good weather
condition (Moon light).
  We see OT-candidate  proposed by J. Gorosabel (GCN 3865) with m =  17.9 
(unfiltered, close to R, exp.  45 sec) on 2-3 sigma level.
Our m = 0.89R + 0.11B (R & B from USNO A).

    UT (start)           After GRB time          m

      23 25 00               764s              17.9      45 sec
     23 31 44        19.5min - 28.5 min        18.3      summ of 9 images
     23 42 07        29.8min - 36.7  min       19.4      summ of 7 images

The calibration will be continued.
The JPG-image of the summ   will be  available at
