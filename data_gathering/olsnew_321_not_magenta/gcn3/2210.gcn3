At 09:59:18.85 UTC (35958.85 s UT) on 18 April 2003, the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments detected event H2686, a long, X-ray-rich GRB.

The burst triggered FREGATE in the 30-400 keV energy band.  The WXM
flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Notice at
10:02:54 UTC, 215 sec after the beginning of the burst.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a refined location, which was
reported in a GCN Notice at 11:43:01 UTC, 104 minutes after the
beginning of the burst.  The WXM ground localization SNR was 9.  The
WXM localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 9
arcminutes in radius and is centered at:

R.A. = 10h 54m 53s, Dec. = -06d 59' 22" (J2000).

The SXC was off because of illumination by the full moon.

The T_90 duration of the burst in the 30-400 keV band was ~ 135 s.  The
fluence of the burst was ~ 1.2 x 10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 2-25 keV energy
band and ~ 2.5 x 10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 30-400 keV energy band; thus
S(2-25)/S(30-400 keV) ~ 0.5.  Therefore this burst is an X-ray-rich
GRB.
