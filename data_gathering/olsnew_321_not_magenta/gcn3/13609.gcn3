L. Elenin (KIAM), A. Volnova (SAI MSU), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 120802A (Holland et al., GCN 13555) with 
0.45-m telescope ?f ISON-NM observatory  starting on  Aug. 02 (UT) 08:13:18 
(Elenin et al., GCN 13556).  We took  several unfiltered images of 30 s  and 
60 s exposures starting on Aug. 02, (UT)  08:13:18.  At the edge of the 
enhanced by UVOT field astrometry  XRT error circle 
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/529486)  we marginally detect a source 
in coordinates 02:59:22.35  +13:46:07.2  (uncertainty of about 0.3 arsces in 
both coordinates).   A preliminary  photometry of  co-added frames is based 
on the USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby  stars is following:

T_start,     T0+,           Exposure, Object,
(UT)           mid, d         (s)

08:13:18    0.06905   6360          21.2+/-0.6

We suggest the source might be an optical afterglow of GRB 120802A, however 
at that time we cannot confirm the fading origin of the source.
