The long-duration GRB 160908A (Konus-Wind trigger time on 05:17:01.127;
INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7558) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 05:17:00.07 on 8 September 2016.  The burst signal was seen by
all CGBM instruments.  Please note that the trigger time reported on the GCN CALET
GBM Flight Lightcurve notice, 05:17:00.74 UT, was wrongly reported due to the real-time
pipeline issue.  The correct trigger time is 05:17:00.07 UT.

The light curve of the SGM shows four peaks.  The whole burst emission
starts at T-5 sec and ends at T+40 sec.  The four spikes peak at T+8 sec,
T+16 sec, T+26 sec and T+41 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data
is 36.2 +- 5.1 sec (40-1000 keV).

CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
