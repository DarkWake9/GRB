At 21:17:28 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060102 (trigger=175603).
The spacecraft did not slew to this burst because of the Moon observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 328.852d,-1.846d
{21h 55m 25s,-01d 50' 44"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows a multi-peak
structure with a total duration of ~20 sec.  The peak count rate was
~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 seconds after the trigger.

[GCN OPS NOTE(03jan06): The time is wrong (as noted in Circ 4424).  The 02:45:43
value was changed to 21:17:28 UT.  All the other values are correct.]
[GCN OPS NOTE(03feb06): per author's request, "E.Retter" was changed to "A.Retter".]
