TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  630
SUBJECT: GRB000301c results

FROM:    SG Bhargavi at Indian Inst of Astrophysics  <bhargavi@iiap.ernet.in>

SG Bhargavi and R Cowsik (IIA, Bangalore) report the
results of optical data on GRB000301c observed
between Mar 2-4, 2000 (GCN-591):
 
 
Mar 2.9618UT    R=20.02 \pm 0.03, B-R=0.97 \pm 0.2
Mar 4.9087UT    R=20.58 \pm 0.05, B-R=0.734 \pm 0.14
Mar 3.9976UT    R=20.49 \pm 0.10 
 
 
The R-band magnitudes from VBT along with other values
from various GCN circulars have been plotted. The numbers marked
on the graph correspond to the serial number of entries in the table.
Two solid lines are fit by \alpha = -0.722 +/- 0.05 and 
\alpha=-2.9 +/- 0.017, which seems to be a better fit than the dotted
lines where the power law index is \alpha = -0.97+/- 0.07 and 
/alpha= -1.99 +/- 0.19 respectively. 
 
(Mid-expoure time for B-R is 2.975UT and 4.9375UT respectively;
this combined with B-R values in GCN \#588, 585 shows that B-R is
falling as -0.25mag/day)
 
The table as well as the graph (post-script file) are available
