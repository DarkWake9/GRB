T. Hattori, K. Aoki (Subaru Telescope, NAOJ), and N. Kawai
(Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team:

"We observed the field of GRB 070521 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 6431) 
with FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope starting at 07:31(UT) (40 min after
the trigger) with total exposures of 1920 sec (120s x 16) in z'-band 
and 360 sec (120s x 3) in i'-band.  

We detected a faint source inside the XRT error circle at

RA=16:10:38.55, DEC=30:15:27.7 

with a positional uncertainty of 0.5"
and an approximate magnitude of z' ~ 23.5.

We obtained 3600 sec long-slit spectra of this faint source 
covering a wavelength range from 6000 to 10000 Ang.  
We detected [O III] 5007, 4959 emission lines at z=0.553.
If this object is the host galaxy of GRB 070521, its location at a
relatively low redshift makes it a good candidate for searching the
supernova component.  Note, however, that the absence of a bright
afterglow may indicate that the GRB source is embedded in a region
with high extinction, or the host identification is spurious.

We thank the Subaru Observatory for the support of this observation."
