NUMBER:  2805
SUBJECT: GRB 041015 - A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

A faint, 30 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on October 15  at 11:11:30 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band but with a significance below the
threshold for automatic delivery of the IBAS Alert Packets.

Its coordinates (J2000)  are:

R.A. =   0h   18m 37s
Dec. = +66d   51' 37''

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin  (90% c.l. radius)

The preliminary analysis indicates a peak flux of 0.2 photons/cm2/s
(3.6e-8 erg/cm2/s) in the 20-200 keV range (1 sec integration)
