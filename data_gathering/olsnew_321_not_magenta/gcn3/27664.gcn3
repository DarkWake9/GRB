Investigation of time series data over the last two days reveals the clear detections of multiple bursts in the data, originating from a direction consistent with outbursting SGR 1935+2154 (GCNs 27663, 27661, 27660, 27659, 27657, 27631, 27625, 27623, 27554, 27531, 27527). Owing to the limited localisation abilities of CZTI, we limit this report to bursts reported by other instruments. We see the following clear detections (UTC):

Further analysis of data is under way. The source is close to the plane of detectors (angle from boresight, theta = 95 degrees), hence the incident photons are heavily reprocessed by the satellite before being incident on the detector. Any source spectrum inferences are unlikely.
