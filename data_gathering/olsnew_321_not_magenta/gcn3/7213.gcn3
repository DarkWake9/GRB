D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) and P. A. Ward (MSSL-UCL) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

Swift-BAT triggered at 15:27:41.15 UT (trigger=301687). 
This is the first occurrance of the new (so called)
SubThreshold triggers within the the BAT flight ops system. 
This is NOT a real burst.  It is a noise trigger
that occurred while Swift was entering the SAA. 

Swift-BAT triggered a second time at 15:44:56.54 UT (trigger 301689). 
This is also not a real burst. 

Please note that some of the regular GCN Notices
were distributed to the world because of (a) an error
in the filtering code in the GCN, and (b) the second
SubThreshold trigger disrupts the filtering process
from the Notices that continue to come out from the first trigger.
