The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely short GRB.

At 06:12:47.41 UT on 28 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220528A (trigger 675411172 / 220528259).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 311.2, DEC = 24.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 20 h 44 m, 24 d 18 '), with a statistical uncertainty
of 4.9 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 68
degrees.
