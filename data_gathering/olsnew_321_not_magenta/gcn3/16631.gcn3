V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA), A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL), P.  
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift began observing the field of GRB 140723A on 2014-07-23 at 15:20  
UT, 49 ks after the LAT trigger (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 16623). A  
tiled observation of four contiguous fields centered on the LAT >  
coordinates has been secured. The total integration time is 3 ks, >  
i.e., about 750 s per field. Our mosaic covers more than 90% of the  
LAT error circle (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 16623), but less than 10%  
of the observed area lies within the IPN error localization, published  
after our observation began (Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 16625).

In the XRT exposure, we do not find any new source, down to a three  
sigma upper limit of 1.4E-02 cts/s. In the UVOT u-band data we do not  
find any new source down to a three sigma upper limit of about 20.2 mag.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
