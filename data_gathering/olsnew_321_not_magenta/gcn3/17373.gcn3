The long-duration, intense GRB 150201A
(Swift BAT trigger 629302: Cannizzo et al., GCN 17368;
Fermi-GBM detection: Yu and Pelassa, GCN 17370)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=49611.653 s UT (13:46:51.653).

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked pulse with a total duration 
of ~26 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.
No post-burst activity was observed by Konus-Wind until ~T0+450s;
also, since the instrument switched to the read-out mode,
there are no triggered or waiting mode data available for the time
of the second GBM trigger 150201590 (14:09:56 UT; GCN 17370).

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB150201_T49611/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 6.18(-0.22,+0.23)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+1.712 s,
of 2.10(-0.28,+0.30)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+22.272 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.20(-0.11,+0.13),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.89(-0.27,+0.17),
the peak energy 123(-6,+5) keV
(chi2 = 88/93 dof)

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+2.048 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.77(-0.12,+0.14),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.47(-0.25,+0.17),
the peak energy 193(-20,+21) keV
(chi2 = 65/50 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
