IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches [1,2] for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate S191222n
 in a time range of 1000 seconds [3] centered on the alert event time
(2019-12-22 03:27:17.119 UTC to 2019-12-22 03:43:57.119 UTC) have been performed.

During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No significant track-like events are found in spatial coincidence of
S191222n calculated from the map circulated in the 1-Preliminary notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment
of S191222n ranges from 0.029 to 1.028 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>
