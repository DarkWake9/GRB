Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060510A (trigger #209351)
(Krimm, et al., GCN 5095).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec =
95.855, -1.166 deg {6h 23m 25.1s, -1d 9' 56.5"} (J2000) +- 1.2 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 6%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurves shows several overlapping peaks
starting at T-8 sec amd ;lasting out to T+25 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 21 +- 3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.0 to T+17.1 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.55 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
9.8 +- 0.5 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 17.0 +- 1.9 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.   Because
this burst occured at the edge of the BAT FOV (note the low partial
coding percentage), the spectral fit values have an extra systematic error
contribution of about 10%.
