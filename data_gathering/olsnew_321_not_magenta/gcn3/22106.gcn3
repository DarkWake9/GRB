SUBJECT: Fermi-GBM Trigger 531686417 / 171106778 is not related to ICECUBE-171106A

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

“At 18:39:39.21 UT, a candidate neutrino ICECUBE-171106A was reported (AMON
ICECUBE EHE NOTICE 130214; GCN 22105) that is temporally coincident with
the Fermi-GBM trigger 531686417 / 171106778. However, this trigger was due
to a pulse from the Be X-ray binary Swift J0243.6+6124 (Cenko et al., GCN
21960) and is spatially inconsistent with the neutrino event.

Fermi-GBM has been triggering on emission from Swift J0243.6+6124 since Oct
30th (Bissaldi et al., GCN 22075), and to reduce the trigger rate due to
this source, the GBM team has disabled some of the onboard triggering
algorithms (Briggs et al., GCN 22097). The GBM team will not issue GCN
Circulars to classify individual events that were misclassified in
automatic notices.

The ground-based GBM subthreshold transient search (
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/admin/fermi_gbm_subthreshold_announce.txt) has
not been modified and will continue to generate GCN Notices due to Swift
J0243.6+6124 (Briggs et al., GCN 22047).”
