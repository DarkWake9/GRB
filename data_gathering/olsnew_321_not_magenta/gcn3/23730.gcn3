LaPorte (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P.
D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) and M.H. Siegel report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 2.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 190114B (Siegel et al. GCN
Circ. 23686), from 165 s to 104.3 ks after the	BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 23691).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=2.1 (+/-0.4).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.99 (+0.34, -0.14). The
best-fitting absorption column is  consistent with the Galactic value
of 1.7 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed
(unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this
spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11 (3.4 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.7 (+/-4.8) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.7 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.99 (+0.34, -0.14)
