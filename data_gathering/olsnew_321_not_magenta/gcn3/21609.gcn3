We observed the field of SSS17a (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et 
al., GCN 21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531), the potential counterpart of 
the LIGO/Virgo event G298048 (GCN 21509), with the 0.5m Virgin Island 
Robotic Telescope (VIRT) on August the 19th, starting at 23:19 UT. We 
performed a series of exposures in the R and Clear filters, with an 
elevation decreasing from 40 degrees. The weather conditions were good, 
with a mean seeing of 2-3 arcsec.

We detect an excess at the position of the potential counterpart in C 
filter at 23:54 UT. Strong contamination from the nearby galaxy prevents 
a precise brightness estimate without galaxy substraction. Further 
analysis is in progress.

The VIRT is still in its commissioning phase.
