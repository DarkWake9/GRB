In an analysis finished at 2017-08-19 19:07:25, we searched IceCube online track-like neutrino candidates (GFU) detected in a [-500,500] second interval about the LIGO-Virgo trigger G298389. We compared the candidate source directions of 6 temporally-coincident neutrinos to the LIB skymap, with the following parameters:

#            dt[s]     RA[deg]    Dec[deg]      E[TeV]  Sigma[deg]
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.          -29.47       104.5       -32.2       98.85         1.9
2.          -27.58        78.2        64.7        0.91         1.0
3.           28.18         7.7         1.8        3.87         0.3
4.          193.16       237.2         7.0        0.64         0.7

6.          477.83         0.3       -66.2      141.53         0.2


(dt--time from GW in [seconds]; RA/Dec--sky location in [degrees]; E--reconstructed secondary muon energy in [TeV]; Sigma--uncertainty of direction reconstruction in [degrees])

The analysis found NO COINCIDENT ONLINE TRACK-LIKE NEUTRINO CANDIDATES detected by IceCube within the 500 second window surrounding G298389 within the LIB skymap.

A coincident neutrino-GW skymap has been posted to GraceDB (<https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G298389/files/coinc_skymap_initial_icecube.png,0>). A JSON-formatted list of the above neutrinos can be downloaded from GraceDB at: <https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G298389/files/IceCubeNeutrinoList.json,0>

In addition, we are performing coincident searches with other IceCube data streams, including the high-energy starting events (HESE) and Supernova triggers.  HESE events have typical energies > 60 TeV and start inside the detector volume, leading to a relatively pure event sample with a high fraction of astrophysical neutrinos.  The SN trigger system is sensitive to sudden increases in photomultiplier counts across the detector, which could indicate a burst of MeV neutrinos.  We will submit separate GCN circulars if coincident HESE or SN triggers are found.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
