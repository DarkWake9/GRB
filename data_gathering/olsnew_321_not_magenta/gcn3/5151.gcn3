P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OAB), S. Piranomonte (INAF/OARm), A. Magazzu`, G.
Mainella (INAF/TNG), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060522 (Fox et al. GCN 5150) with the 3.6m
TNG telescope located in Canary Islands. One R-band image was obtained
with TNG+DOLoRes, starting on May 22.1556 UT (about 1.5 hours after the
burst) for a total exposure time of 10 minutes.

We see a bright object at the following position:

R.A.= 21:31:44.8, Dec +02:53:10.35 +/- 0.20 arcsec (J2000)

with a magnitude of R = 20.6 +/- 0.1 (vs USNO@ESO catalog)

We note that the position of this object is consistent with the UVOT
afterglow candidate reported by Fox et al. (GCN 5150). 

We thank the observing staff at TNG.
