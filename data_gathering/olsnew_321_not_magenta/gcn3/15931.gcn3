B. A. Zauderer, T. Laskar, and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 140304A (Evans et al., GCN 15915)
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)
beginning
2014 Mar 5.01 UT (10.8 hours post-burst) at a mean frequency of ~85 GHz.

We detect a radio source with a flux of ~0.5 mJy consistent with the
enhanced Swift-XRT
position (Beardmore et al., GCN 15925), the optical afterglow
localization (Gorbovskoy et al.,
GCN 15914), and our VLA 5.8 GHz position (Laskar et al., GCN 15930).
Follow-up observations are in progress.

We thank the CARMA staff and observers, Shaye Storm and Robin Dong,
for their support of these rapid-response observations."
