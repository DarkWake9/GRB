A. Melandri (INAF/OAB) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT observed the field of GRB 130603A (Melandri et al., GCN  
Circ. 14731) starting at T0+49.7 minutes due to an observing  
constraint. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued X- 
ray source located at RA, Dec = 86.8938, 82.9099 which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) =  05 47 34.51
DEC (J2000.0) =  +82 54 35.7

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).

A source is also detected by Swift-UVOT located at RA, Dec = 86.8914,  
82.9087 which is equivalent to

RA  (J2000.0) =  05 47 33.9
DEC (J2000.0) =  +82 54 31.3

with an uncertainty of 0.8 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest  
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions.  
Position enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,  
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
