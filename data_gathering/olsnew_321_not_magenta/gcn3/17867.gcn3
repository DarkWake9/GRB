H. A. Krimm (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) and C. Gronwall (PSU) report:

We conclude that Swift trigger #641332 (Gronwall, et al., GCN Circ. 17862)
was the result a noise fluctuation in BAT and is not due to a GRB or other
astrophysical event.

We have analyzed the BAT data set from T-239 to T+963 sec sec from recent
telemetry downlinks.  We find that ground analysis results in the significance
dropping to 4.1 sigma from T+0 to T+40 s. There is also no significant source in 
the
rapidly available UVOT data.
