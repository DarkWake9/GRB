J. R. Cummings and D. M Palmer report on behalf of the Swift-BAT science team:

At 11:53:11 Swift was slewing.  A rate increase during the slew was noticed in
ground post-processing.  The BAT lightcurve shows a slow rise and decay peak
with about 90 seconds duration.  A mosaic of BAT images from the slew shows
a significant source at RA, Dec 69.264, -17.258 which is

RA (J2000)    04h 37m 3.4s
Dec (J2000)  -17d 15' 30"

with an estimated error radius of 4 arcmin.

A Swift TOO has been requested.
