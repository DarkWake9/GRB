H.L. Xiao (PSI), R. Marcinkowski (PSI)  and W. Hajdas (PSI) report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-03-06 14:07:20.0 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, POLAR detected GRB 170306B,
which was also observed by  Fermi-GBM (trigger # 510502047), Fermi-LAT (trigger #170306588) and SPI ACS at 2017-03-06 14:07:25.

The POLAR light curve consists of multiple peaks with duration (T90) of 25.0 +/- 1.0 s measured from T0.
The 1.00 s peak flux at T0 + 11.50 s  is equal to 2380 +/- 100 counts/sec.
POLAR recorded 31640 events from the burst.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 15 - 300 keV.

Using the best location from Fermi-LAT, which is (J2000):
RA : 154.650 [deg]
Dec:  51.630 [deg]
Err:  39.00  [arcmin]
the incident angle in the POLAR coordinate at T0 is:
Theta: 87.0 [deg]
Phi: 98.4 [deg]

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which
was launched on-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016.
