The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) data
around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S200213t
(GCN Circular 27042). Parameter estimation has been performed using
Bilby [1] and a new sky map, bilby.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN
Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200213t

The preferred sky map at this time is bilby.fits.gz,0. For the
bilby.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 282 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 141 +/- 56 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
