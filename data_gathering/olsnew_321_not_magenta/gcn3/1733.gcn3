P.A. Price and D.W. Fox (Caltech) report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 021211 (HETE trigger #2493) with the
Palomar 48-inch telescope + NEAT unfiltered camera over the course of
approximately 1.3 hours, commencing 20 minutes after the GRB.  Rough
analysis yields an approximate magnitude for the afterglow during the
first observation of R ~ 18.2 mag.  The source faded with an approximate
power-law index of alpha ~ 0.97 over the course of our exposures.

Further multicolour observations are underway.
