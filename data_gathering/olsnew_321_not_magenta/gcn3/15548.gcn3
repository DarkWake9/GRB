TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  15548
SUBJECT: GRB 131127A: CQUEAN riz Observation
DATE:    13/11/29 14:43:29 GMT
FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

Myungshin Im, Changsu Choi (CEOU/SNU), Hyein Lee, Huynh Ahn N. Le,
and Soojong Pak (Kyunghee Univ.)

We observed the field of GRB 131127A (Markwardt et al. GCN 15516),
using CQEUAN (Park et al. 2012) on the 2.1-m Otto-Struve telescope 
at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, US. The observation started 
at 2013-11-29 01:31:43 UT, or about 1.63 days after the BAT alert. 
A series of images were taken in r, i, and z-band for about 45 min.

We identify the red source reported in Butler et al. (GCN 15525), but
no significant fading of the source was found with z = 21.90 +- 0.15 AB mag,
consistent with Z = 21.85 +- 0.16 mag from Butler et al. (GCN 15525).
This suggests that the red source may not be the GRB afterglow,
or the light curve is changing very slowly.
