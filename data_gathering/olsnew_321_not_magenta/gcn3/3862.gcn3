We observed the XRT error box (Morris et al, GCNs 3812,3816) of GRB050815
(Fox et al, GCN  3811)  with 1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical
Observatory. Set of  R images were taken between (UT) 17:26 - 19:04, on
August 16.

We do not detect the OT  (Schady et al, GCN 3817) in a stacked image.
Limiting magnitude of the stacked image (14x300 s) is R ~ 22.5.  Detailed
photometry of the observation is underway.

The stacked image can be found in
