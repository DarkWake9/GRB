on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have observed the GRB 060428B field (GCN #5017) using Kiso 1.05m
telescope. The R and B band observations were started from 2.3 hours
after the burst (after end of twilight).  The limiting magnitude
derived from USNOB1.0 is R=20.7 (SN=3). The candidate (GCN #5019) do
not appear brighter than the limiting magnitude. This result indicates
that the candidate is afterglow of GRB 060428B.

Further analysis is in progress."
