We report observations of the GW counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (e.g., Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., LVC GCN 21530; Yang et al., LVC GCN 21531) with the second of Antarctica Schmidt Telescopes (AST3-2).  AST3-2 is a 50cm optical telescope located at Kunlun Station at Dome A in the Antarctic.  

Observations were carried out from August 18 through August 28 in g-band filter.  Data transfer from Antarctica has recently completed.  A source with g-band magnitude 18.15 +/-0.1 was detected on  2017-08-18T14:42.6796 (mean value) at the position of SSS17a/DLT17ck.  Note the signal was identified from a coadded image and the observational information about the component images are as follows.
