Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140213A (trigger #586569)
(Holland, et al., GCN Circ. 15825).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 105.166, -73.136 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  07h 00m 39.8s
    Dec(J2000) = -73d 08' 10.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.

The mask-weighted light curve begins at T-120 sec, when the source position
came into the BAT field-of-view during a pre-planned slew.  The emission
begins faintly at ~T-25 sec, and rises sharply beginning at ~T-5.5 sec,
peaks at T-4 sec and a stronger peak at ~T+1 sec, returning almost to baseline
around T+10 sec. Then there is a second, much weaker and softer pulse
at around T+15 sec, followed by an even weaker pulse at ~T+70 sec,
with extended emission out to ~T+160 sec.  The burst position left
the FoV after another pre-planned slew at T+780 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 60.0 +- 
2.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from -5.7 to +82.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.80 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.0 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.56 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 23.5 +- 0.8 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
