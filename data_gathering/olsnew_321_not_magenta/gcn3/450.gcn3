K. Hurley (UCB SSL), on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and
T. Cline (NASA GSFC), on behalf of the KONUS and NEAR GRB teams,
report:

Ulysses, KONUS, and NEAR observed an extremely intense, 60 s long
gamma-ray burst on December 8, 1999, at 04:36:52 UT.  Preliminary
estimates indicate a fluence >25 keV of ~10^-4 erg/cm^2, and
considerable flux was observed by NEAR >100 keV.  We have localized
this burst to a 14 sq. arcmin. error box whose corners are:

RA(2000)   	Decl.(2000)

16 h 33 m 47 s   +46 o 27 ' 43 "
16 h 34 m 08 s   +46 o 20 ' 19 "
16 h 33 m 43 s   +46 o 32 ' 52 "
16 h 34 m 04 s   +46 o 25 ' 29 "

This error box can be refined considerably.
