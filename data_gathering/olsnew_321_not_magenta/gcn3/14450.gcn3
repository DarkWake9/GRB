behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We started observation of  the field of  the Swift GRB 130427A (Maselli et 
al., GCN 14448)  with 0.45-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory on Apr. 27 
(UT)   07:50:17.
On the first images of 30 s exposure we identified very bright optical 
counterpart of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448) at about 12m in the 
intitial images.

The coordinates of the counterpart are (J2000) 11 32 32.84 +27 41 56.2 with 
uncertainties of about 1".
