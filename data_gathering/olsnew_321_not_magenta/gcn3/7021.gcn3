T. Kruehler, J. Greiner, P. Afonso, A. Kuepcue-Yoldas, 
A. Yoldas,  G. Szokoly (all MPE Garching) report for the GROND team:

We started observing GRB 071031 (trigger 295670) simultaneously in grizJHK
with GROND, mounted at the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla (Chile),
about 60 sec after the alert. A bright object (r~15) is seen in all filters,
including the g-band, implying a redshift smaller than 3.5.

The coordinates are

RA (2000.0) = 00h 25m 37.2s
Decl (2000.0) = -58d 03' 30" 

located within the XRT error circle, and consistent with the UVOT position.
