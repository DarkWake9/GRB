report:

Using FORS2 on the 8.2-m Antu Telescope at ESO/Paranal we have
obtained deep VRI-band imaging of the BAT error circle of
GRB 050906 (GCN 3935) on Sep 7.4. No new sources are apparent in
the combined images by comparison to the DSS. At the position of
the radio source (GCN 3933) we detect a faint red object. Using
photometric zeropoints from the ESO webpages we estimate the
following magnitude for this source: V = 26.2, R = 24.5, I = 23.0.
An R-band image of the field around the radio source (located
outside the BAT error circle) is shown at:
