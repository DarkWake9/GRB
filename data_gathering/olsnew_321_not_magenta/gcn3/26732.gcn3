IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches [1,2] for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate S200114f
 in a time range of 1000 seconds [3] centered on the alert event time
(2020-01-14 01:59:58.239 UTC to 2020-01-14 02:16:38.239 UTC) have been performed.

During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No significant track-like events are found in spatial coincidence of
S200114f calculated from the map circulated in the 2-Preliminary notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment
of S200114f ranges from 0.029 to 0.583 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>
