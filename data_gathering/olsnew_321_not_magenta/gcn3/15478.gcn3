D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of Fermi GRB 131108A (Racusin et al., GCN 
15464) with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy at a 
frequency of 93 GHz (3mm) starting at 13:26 UT on 2013-11-09, 16.7 hours 
after the burst.  Observations continued until 14:55 UT (midpoint t=17.5 
hours.)

A source is detected at a position consistent with the location of X-ray 
(Stroh & Kennea, GCN 15468) and optical (Xu et al., GCN 15471) 
afterglows at a flux of approximately ~2 mJy.  Follow-up observations 
are planned.

We thank the CARMA staff for their support in executing these observations.
