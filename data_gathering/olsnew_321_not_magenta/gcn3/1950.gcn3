A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 20x20 arcmin field centered at the coordinates
for the HETE burst GRB030324 (HETE trigger 2641)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one very marginal
photometric night.  Stars brighter than V=13.5 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030324.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
There were approaching clouds from a weak frontal system
that do not appear to have reached this field until well
after the observations, but until further calibration
is performed, a systematic error is possible.  Based purely
on the standard star observations, the estimated external
photometric error is 0.03mag.

If an OT is discovered, this calibration will be extended
with additional nights.  We will not be performing U-band
calibration unless requested.  As always, you should check
the dates on the .dat file prior to final publication to get
the latest photometry.
