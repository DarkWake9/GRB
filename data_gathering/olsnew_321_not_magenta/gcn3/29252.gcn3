We observed the field of GRB 210104A (Troja et al., GCN 29233) using the 
NEXT-0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. 
Observations started at 11:59:19 UT (i.e., 0.538 hr post-burst) on 
2021-01-04 and ended at 22:34:07 UT (i.e., 11.11 hr post-burst) on 
2021-01-04, and a series of 120 s, 200 s, 300 s Sloan r-band frames were 
obtained.

Preliminary analysis of the data shows that afterglow is decaying as 
F_rband ~ t^(-\alpha), where \alpha = 0.73 since the very beginning of 
our observations.

If the afterglow continues to decay in this way, it would be of r ~ 20.3 
mag at 1 day post-burst, and still bright enough for optical spectroscopy.
