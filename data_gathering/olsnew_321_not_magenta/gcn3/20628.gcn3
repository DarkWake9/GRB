and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration, very bright GRB 170207A has been
detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 508196708), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL 
(SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 78304 s UT (21:45:04).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   315.704 (21h 02m 49s) +55.690 (+55d 41' 25")
  Corners:
   307.259 (20h 29m 02s) +52.583 (+52d 35' 00")
   325.165 (21h 40m 40s) +58.232 (+58d 13' 54")
   324.653 (21h 38m 37s) +57.713 (+57d 42' 46")
   306.905 (20h 27m 37s) +51.893 (+51d 53' 34")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 4.66 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 12.17 deg (the minimum one is 24.0 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 70 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
