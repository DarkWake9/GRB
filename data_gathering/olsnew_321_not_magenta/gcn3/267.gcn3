K. Pedersen (Danish Space Research Institute, Copenhagen), 
J. Hjorth, H. Pedersen (Copenhagen University Observatory), and
A.O. Jaunsen (Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, Oslo) report:

We have observed the field of GRB 990217 (Tarei et al., IAUC 7110), 
using the DFOSC instrument on the 1.54-m Danish telescope at 
La Silla.  All exposures were done in the R band. The field 
covered was 13.6 x 13.6 arcminutes, hence significantly larger 
than the BeppoSAX error circle.

UTC (mid exposure)    Exp.    Seeing (fwhm)   Limit

1999 Feb 19.049      1200 s        1.4"      < 23.1      
1999 Feb 20.034      1000 s        1.4"      < 23.0 
1999 Feb 24.037       600 s        1.2"      < 22.8 
 
Intercomparison of the exposure shows no variable object.
