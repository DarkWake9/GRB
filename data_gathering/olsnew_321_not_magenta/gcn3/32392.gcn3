The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:58:06 UT on 14 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220714B (trigger 679499891.272708 / 220714582).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 45.9, Dec = -22.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 03m, -22d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 124.0 degrees.
