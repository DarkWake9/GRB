A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), A. F. Valeev (SAO-RAS), Y.-D. Hu and E. 
Fernandez-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), V. Sokolov (SAO-RAS), R. Sanchez-Ramirez 
(INAF-IAPS) and J. Font (GRANTECAN, IAC, ULL), on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

Following the detection of AT2020pq/ZTF20aaervyn, AT2020ps/ZTF20aaerqbx 
and AT2020pv/ZTF20aaertpj (Stein et al. GCNC 26673) within the error 
area of the GW event S200105ae (LVC, GCNC 26640), we obtained optical 
spectroscopy covering the range 3700-7400 A with the 10.4m GTC telescope 
equipped with OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) starting on Jan 11, 06:03 UT.

For AT2020pq/ZTF20aaervyn, the GTC spectrum is consistent with a SN Ia 
close to maximum, at redshift z = 0.112 +/- 0.004, consistent with the 
redshift of the host galaxy derived from the emission lines (z = 0.1146 
+/- 0.0005).

For AT2020ps/ZTF20aaerqbx, the GTC spectrum is consistent with a SN IIp 
about 5 days prior to maximum at redshift z = 0.098 +/- 0.016, 
consistent with the redshift of the host galaxy derived from the 
emission lines (z = 0.0780 +/- 0.0005).

For AT2020pv/ZTF20aaertpj, the GTC spectrum is consistent with a SN Ib 
close to maximum at redshift z = 0.026 +/- 0.006, consistent with the 
redshift of the host galaxy derived from the emission lines (z = 0.0280 
Â± 0.0005).

Therefore we consider that AT2020pq/ZTF20aaervyn, AT2020ps/ZTF20aaerqbx 
and AT2020pv/ZTF20aaertpj are unrelated to the S200105ae GW alert.
