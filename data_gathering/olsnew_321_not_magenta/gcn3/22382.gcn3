SUBJECT: GRB 180205A: KAIT optical afterglow confirmation

WeiKang Zheng and Alex Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf
of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 180205A (Evans, et al.,GCN
22381), starting at 04:31:40 UT immediately after receiving the
trigger. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time
was 20 s per imag. We detect the bright optical afterglow reported
by UVOT (Evans, et al.,GCN 22381). It faded from clear ~15.6 mag
from our first clear band image to ~16.8 mag 22.5 minutes later,
we therefore confirm it to be the optical afterglow of GRB 180205A.
