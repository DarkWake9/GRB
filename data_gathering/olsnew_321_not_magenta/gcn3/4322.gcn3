The Southern African Large Telescope, currently in
Performance-Verification phase, observed the field of
GRB 051210 during evening twilight, and through
thickening cloud, with the Salticam CCD camera. Based on
comparison with nearby sources, and assuming R-I = 0, we
find no sources inside the Swift-XRT error circle
(Mangano et al; GCN 4315) down to a limiting magnitude
of I = 20.2 at 2005/12/10 18:48 UT.

[GCN OPS NOTE(12dec05): The Subject line was changed from 051201 to 051210.]
