MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to
HETE GRB051028.6 (GCN 4172).
An automated response took  first image 2005-10-28 16:59:56 UT,
03h 23 m  after the GRB time (GCN4171).
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
We  not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  17.9 on the 
summ of  9 images between 17 32 40 - 18 03 03 UT.
Mean time is 17 48 09 ( 4 h 12 min after GRB Time).

The JPG-image of the summ   will be  available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB050828/1.jpg  (In error circ you can 
see candidates which we recognised with 2MASS ).
The reduction is continuing.
