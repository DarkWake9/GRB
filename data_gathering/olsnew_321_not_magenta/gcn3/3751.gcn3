Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP-OAMP),
Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 050803 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 148833) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

Trigger occured at twilight and first image was acquired
60.9 min after the GRB. The field had an elevation of
5 degrees above horizon at the begining of the observations
and then increased.

We detected no new source comparing our unfiltered images
with the DSS-2 ones. Following limits comes to co-additions
of several sets of exposures.

Tmid (min since GRB)  Exp (s)  R-Mag
  60.9 -  63.4           90     >16.0
  83.9 - 102.8         1080     >17.8
  83.9 - 156.1         3600     >18.7

Limiting magnitude were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars.
