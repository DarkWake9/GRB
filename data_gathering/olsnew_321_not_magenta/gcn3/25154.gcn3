The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:24:53 UT on 26 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190726A (trigger 585847498.610468 / 190726642).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 310.3, Dec = 34.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 41m, 34d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
