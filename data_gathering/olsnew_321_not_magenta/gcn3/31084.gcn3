The long GRB 211115A (MAXI/GSC detection: Serino et al., GCN Circ. 31082;
Fermi-GBM trigger #658686687) was detected in ground analysis
of the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data near the MAXI trigger time
at 16:31:19 UTC on 15 November 2021.
The burst signal was weakly seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~10 sec.

The ground processed light curve is available at
