Matthew Bailes (Swinburne University of Technology-OzGrav) on behalf of the
SUPERB and OzGrav collaborations.

We report on further Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search observations of GW counterpart
SSS17a/DLTck (eg. Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) with the Parkes 64m Radio
Telescope in FRB search mode.

Three additional hours of data were retrieved and reduced from 0.38-0.5d after the
GW event using the same observing setup as that used in GCN circular 28199.
The observations commenced at UTC 2017-08-18 06:49:31 (2h) and
UTC 2017-08-18 08:50:36 (1h). No FRBs were detected with a flux limit
of 1.4 Jy (w/64 us)^{-1/2} where w is the observed width of the FRB in
microseconds.
