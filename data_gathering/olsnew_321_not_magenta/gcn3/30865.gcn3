The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 11:49:36 UT on 23 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210923A (trigger 654090581.820056 / 210923493).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 90.0, Dec = -6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 00m, -6d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 47.0 degrees.
