Volnova (IKI),  I. Reva (Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161011A  (D'Elia et al., GCN 20023)  with 
Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory. 
We obtained several images in R filter starting on Oct. 11 (UT) 
13:13:27.  In the enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne al., GCN 20026) we 
marginally detect an object which is absent in SDDS-DR9 catalog. 
Preliminary photometry of the object which we suggest as an afterglow 
candidate is following

Date       UT start   t-T0    Filter  Exp.   OT     Err.  UL
                       (mid, days)     (s)
2016-10-11 13:13:27   0.32098 R       21*120 20.6   0.3   20.8

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars (Lupton transformations):
SDSS-DR9_id            R
J162253.68+081834.3    15.26
