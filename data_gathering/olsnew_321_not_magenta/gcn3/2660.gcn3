At 16.8h after  HETE alert 11553  MASTER robotic telescope
(http://observ.pereplet.ru) had imaging  the corresponding area of the sky.

We have 60 unfiltered images of the error box (60s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin, 200 mm camera).

The unfiltered optical limit on sum is about 20m.

The visual comparison between these images with the DSS plate does not
reveal any new source.


Sum FITS image  are available at
