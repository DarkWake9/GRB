Luigi Piro, BeppoSAX Mission Scientist, reports:

On July 4, 17:30:20 UT  a GRB (GRB990704) was detected
simultaneously by the GRBM and WFC of BeppoSAX.

Preliminary coordinates from WFC are:
R.A.(2000)= 184.87
DEC(2000)= -03.796

Due to the less-than-optimal attitude configuration the
error radius is of about 8'.

A follow-on with NFI is being planned.
