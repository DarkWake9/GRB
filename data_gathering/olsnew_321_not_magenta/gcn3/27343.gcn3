We observed the field of GRB 200306A (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 27326)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2020/03 7.27 to
2020/03 7.54 UTC (7.61 to 14.01 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 4.31 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9 catalog, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limits :

  r	> 23.34
  i	> 23.71

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
