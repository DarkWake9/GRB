The long GRB 191221B (Swift detection: Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 26534,
Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 26562; AGILE/MCAL observations: Longo et al.,
GCN Circ. 26549; AstroSat CZTI detection: Gaikwad et al., GCN Circ. 26567;
Insight-HXMT/HE detection: Xue et al., GCN Circ. 26573;
Konus-Wind observation: Frederiks et al., GCN Circ. 26576;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/191221B.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 20:39:04.868 UTC on 21 December 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked pulse which starts
at T+1.8 sec, peaks at T+11.3 sec and ends at T+23.4 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
13.0 +- 1.6 sec and 4.4 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve will be available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
