At 00:27:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120213A (trigger=514767).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 301.032, +65.397, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 04m 08s
   Dec(J2000) = +65d 23' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single FRED pulse
with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 00:28:09.0 UT, 49.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued, fading  X-ray source 
located at RA, Dec 301.0105, 65.4092 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +20h 04m 2.52s
   Dec(J2000) = +65d 24' 33.1"
with an uncertainty of 5.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 54 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 0.1 s image was 4.08e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 58 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.22. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. Sakamoto (Taka.Sakamoto AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
