W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS observed
this burst at 79159 s.  As observed by INTEGRAL, it had a duration
of approximately 1 second.  This burst appears to be in the
short-hard category.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary,
3 sigma error box whose area is approximately 1500 sq. arminutes
and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  8 h 43 m 42.90 s    -48 o 53 '  57.38 "  (CENTER)
  8 h 52 m 58.66 s    -49 o 35 '  34.81 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 53 m 20.75 s    -49 o 28 '  54.32 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 34 m 22.50 s    -48 o 15 '   5.44 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 34 m 46.40 s    -48 o  8 '  39.98 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved, but as this event was not
observed by Ulysses, a small error box cannot be obtained
for it.
