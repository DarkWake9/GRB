Using the data set from T-790 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161011A (trigger #716876)
(D'Elia, et al. GCN Circ. 20023).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 245.687, 8.313 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 22m 44.9s
   Dec(J2000) = +08d 18' 47.3"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 43%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak single-pulse structure that
starts at ~T0, peaks at ~ T+1 s, and ends at ~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is
4.3 +- 1.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.3 to T+4.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.15 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.37 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
