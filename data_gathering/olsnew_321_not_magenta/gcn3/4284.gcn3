D.B. Fox (Penn State) and R.H. McNaught (RSAA/ANU, SSO) report on behalf
of a larger colloboration:

"We have observed the Swift localization region for GRB 051117B (Band
et al., GCN 4281) with the 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring
Observatory, in a series of unfiltered exposures beginning at 14:12 UT
(49 minutes after the burst).  A coadded exposure at mean epoch 14:16
UT reveals no source coincident with the XRT position (Beardmore et
al., GCN 4282), nor any new sources within the BAT localization region
by comparison to the DSS.  We estimate our limiting magnitude for this
image to be R=18.8 mag by comparison to the USNO-B1.0 catalog R-band
magnitudes of nearby stars."
