(for the Swift-BAT and -XRT teams):
 
Swift-BAT trigger 348720 is not a GRB.   Analysis of the full data set
from recent telemetry downlinks shows the trigger to be due to coincident
noise fluctuations in the rate and image domains.

Followup observations by the XRT found only a single, weak source in
the BAT error circle that is consistent in position with a DSS object.
The lack of any detected X-ray afterglow confirms that the trigger
was not from a GRB.
