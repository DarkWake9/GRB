The Fermi-GBM burst GRB 090929A (Rau, GCN Circular# 9962) occurred
during a preplanned Swift slew maneuver.  A strong source was found
in a mosaic of images from BAT event data, which is often collected
during slews.  The source location was RA, Dec = 56.494, -5.952 or

RA (J2000) 03h 45m 57.9s
Dec (J2000) -05d 57' 50"

with an estimated 90% containment error radius of 3 arcmin. The
partial coding was 73-90% during the burst.

We define the trigger time as 04:33:08 UTC.  As seen in BAT, the
burst had three progressively weaker peaks, at T+1, T+4, and T+8.
The peak count rate (15-350 keV) was ~18000 counts/sec at T+2 sec.
T90 was about 10 seconds.

A Swift TOO has been requested and approved.
