Now having recieved the full downlinked data that fills in the gaps
(Tueller et al, GCN 5090), we report the updated refined analysis
on Swift-BAT GRB 060507 (trigger 208870).

The lightcurve description in GCN 5090 does not change, nor does T90.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-10.2 to T+192.4 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.83 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
4.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+1.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
