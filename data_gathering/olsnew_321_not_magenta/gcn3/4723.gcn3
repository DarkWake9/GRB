D.B. Fox (Penn State) and S.B. Cenko (Caltech) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

"We have imaged the XRT localization region for GRB060210 (Swift
Trigger #180977) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope, in
two 60-second exposures beginning roughly 5 minutes after the BAT
trigger.  We identify a single point-like, bright, stationary
source consistent with the XRT position, at coordinates:

    R.A. 03:50:57.41, Dec +27:01:34.4 (J2000)

with a coordinate uncertainty of less than 2" in each axis.  The
estimated brightness of the transient at t+5.5 minutes is
R=18.3 +/- 0.1 mag by reference to USNO B-1.0 catalog magnitudes
of stars in the field."
