N. J. Klingler (PSU), M. J. Moss (GWU), D. M. Palmer (LANL),
B. Sbarufatti (PSU), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report
on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 11:27:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190610A (trigger=907754).  Swift did not slew to
the burst location due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 46.289, -7.666 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 05m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 39' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 1 sec.  This is superimposed
on a rising background rate due to the approach of the SAA. 
The peak count rate was ~10,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), 
at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 10:44 UT on 2019 June 14. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
