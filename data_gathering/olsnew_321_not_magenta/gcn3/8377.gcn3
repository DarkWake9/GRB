D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), S. Soldi, 
V.Beckmann, M. Beck, M. Tuerler (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, 
Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 34 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 
06:51:31 UT of October 16. 

The coordinates (J2000) are:

RA = 255.5725 [degrees]
DEC= -23.3301 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst is composed by two distinct peaks, and a preliminary spectral 
analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of about 2.4 
ph/cmsq/s (1-s integration time) and a fluence over the same energy range 
of about 1.8x10e-6 erg/cmsq. Due to data gaps caused by telemetry 
saturation these values should be considered as lower limits.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
