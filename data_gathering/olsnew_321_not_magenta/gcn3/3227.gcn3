     The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) observed the field of
GRB 050408 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 3189) starting at 17:07:08 UT on 8 April
2005.  There is a faint source at the location of the optical afterglow
(de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 3192) visible in the coadded U-band image.  
This source has U = 21.30 (-0.32,+0.45) mag and the total coadded exposure
time is 2927 s.  This source is at the 3-sigma detection limit of the
coadded image and is only marginally consistent with being a point source.  
There is no detection in the other filters.  The 3-sigma limiting
magnitudes in a 3.5 arcsecond radius circular aperture , and the coadded
exposure times, are: V = 21.3 (3866 s), B = 22.2 (2910 s), UVW1 = 17.8
(3223 s), UVM2 = 17.6 (1989 s), and UVW2 = 17.82 (3402 s).  The magnitudes
reported in this Circular are based upon preliminary flight calibrations.

     The first Swift/UVOT image of the field was a 100 s V-band exposure
centred 45.117 minutes after the BAT trigger.  No source is detected in
this image down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of V = 19.9.
