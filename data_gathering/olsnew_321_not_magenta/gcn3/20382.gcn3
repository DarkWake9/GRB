Following on from GCN 20377, we have processed the ATLAS data
beginning at 57758.296 (2016-01-05.296 UT) which started at a pointing
centre of RA=80, DEC=-30, and moved north and east across the northern
sky lobe to RA=170,80.

We find one transient that appears to be new (and recovered old
ones). This object has some unusual characteristics that warrant
further attention

ATLAS17aeu 09:13:13.89 +61:05:33.6 (138.30789 +61.09267) J2000

The position is within the inner 16% probability contour.  This object
is not spatially coincident with any star or host galaxy.

The lightcurve faded by 0.85 mag over 1.176hrs

(the cyan mag is effectively an average of g and r). 

The object has now fallen below the detection limit (orange filter; 
o ~ 19) on the night of 57759. 

Such a fast fade is unusual if the object is extragalactic. 

The obvious immediate explanations for this object are 
1) It is not a real astrophysical transient. We consider this unlikely. 
2) The photometric errors are under-estimated and it is flat. We consider
this unlikely, and the errors to be reliable. 
3) It is a Galactic CV. But the fading is too fast for typical CVs.
4) It is an M-dwarf flare. But the fading is slow for a typical
M-dwarf (which are usually between 2 and >5 mags per hour)

We note that there is no faint point source in the Pan-STARRS 3Pi
stacked sky (Chambers et al. 2017, arXiv:1612.05560, and
http://panstarrs.stsci.edu).  There is no counterpart in the MPC,
Vizier, WISE, various CV and stellar catalogues.

The object is 23 arcsec from the galaxy SDSS J091312.36+610554.2 which
has a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.199 +/- 0.00004.  This implies a
luminosity distance of 990 Mpc (for Ho=69).  If ATLAS17aeu is related,
it would be at a projected distance of 75kpc from the Galaxy.

This luminosity distance is consistent with the BAYESTAR 3D volume
rendering (Singer et al. 2016, ApJ 829, L1) of G268556 which suggests
a 10-90 percentile probability of 520-1010 Mpc in this direction.

If it were associated with the z = 0.199 +/- 0.00004 galaxy, then it 
would be unusually luminous (M_g ~ -21.5). 

While a Galactic origin is still the most probable, it remains to be
confirmed. We encourage a search of any contemporaneous data taken at
the same time we detected this object and deep imaging of the position
to recover any host object (star or galaxy).
