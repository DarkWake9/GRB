We observed the field of GRB 210822A (Page et al., GCN 30677) using the 
NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 
15x100 s frames in the Sloan r-band and 10x100 s frames in the V-band, 
starting at 14:42:53 UT on 2021-08-22, i.e., 5.41 hr after the BAT trigger.

The optical afterglow (e.g., Page et al., GCN 30677; Zheng & Filippenko, 
GCN 30679) of the burst is clearly detected in our stacked images. 
Preliminary photometry results are as follows:
