The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:40:38 UT on 7 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210507A (trigger 642105643.041502 / 210507778).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 285.9, Dec = -7.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 03m, -7d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
