On UT 2020-01-19, we imaged ZTF20aafqvyc/AT2020yq (Anand et al. GCN 26767)
found in the localization region of LIGO/Virgo S200115j (GCN 26759, GCN
26807) with the Sinistro camera on the 1-m LCO Global Telescope Network
(LCOGT, Brown et al., 2013).
We obtained a series of 3 exposures of 300 s in g-, r- and i-bands. After
stacking the data, no source is detected at the source location down to a 3
sigma limits of g = 22.6 AB mag , r = 21.8 AB mag and i = 20.9 AB mag.
