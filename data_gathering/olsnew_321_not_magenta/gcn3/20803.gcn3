The long-duration GRB 170228B (Fermi GBM trigger #509999585;
Xiao et al, GCN Circ. 20792) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (CGBM) at 18:32:58.03 on 28 February 2017.  The burst signal
was seen by the HXM2 and SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows two peaks.  The first peak starts at T0,
peaks at T+5 sec and ends at T+18 sec.  The second peak starts at T+20 sec,
peaks at T+25 sec and ends at T+35 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 32.2 +- 1.2 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
