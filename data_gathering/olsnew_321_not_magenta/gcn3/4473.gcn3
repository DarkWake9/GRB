TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4473
SUBJECT: GRB 060110: UKIRT K-band observations

N.R. Tanvir, A.J Levan (U. Hertfordshire), F. Nakata (U. Durham)
and L. Fuhrman (JACH) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060110 with UKIRT/WFCAM.  A 21 min K-band
exposure was made in ~1.1 arcsec seeing, starting Jan 10 08.47 UT
(ie. approximately 45 minutes post-burst).

The source reported by Bloom et al. (GCN 4465) is clearly detected
in our images, and provisional photometry relative to nearby 2MASS stars
gives K=13.75+/-0.10.   Compared to the magnitudes reported by Bloom (GCN
4471), the source appears to have faded, although the errors are such
that a constant brightness is not strongly rejected.

Further observations are in progress.
