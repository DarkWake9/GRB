G. Masi and P. L. Catalano, the Virtual Telescope Project - Italy, report:

We started observations of GRB 140907A (Krimm et al., GCN 16788) with the 17" 
robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope (Ceccano, Italy) at 21:46:00 UT.

An optical source is visible where described by D. Xu et al. (GCN 16789) in a 
image coming from the sum of tfour, 300-seconds exposures, unfiltered. The 
position of the source is RA: 03 12 35.00 Decl.: +46 36 17.6 (J2000.0, mean 
residuals of 0.2") and the magnitude was estimated to be around 20.0, assuming R 
mags for the reference stars from UCAC-4.

The message may be cited.
