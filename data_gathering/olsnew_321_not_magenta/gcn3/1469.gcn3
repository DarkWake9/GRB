report on behalf of VSNET-grb collaboration:

"We have observed the field of GRB 020812 (HETE trigger 2257) with R band
exposures using the 60-cm RC telescope at Ouda station starting at Aug. 12
11:09 UT (28 min after the burst).  We imaged the field (field size 20
arcmin) centered at the first localization (HETE #2257, Seq_Num 2)
until 13:30 UT.  We have been imaging the field centered at the second
localozation (HETE #2257, Seq_Num 3) since 13:33 UT.  Preliminary
visual inspection of the images has not revealed a new object down
to R=18.  Further analysis and observation are in progress."
