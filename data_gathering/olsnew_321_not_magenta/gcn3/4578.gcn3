We have analyzed the first orbit of XRT data from GRB 060124
(trigger 178750; Holland et al., GCN 4570).
The observation consists of an 865 s exposure in Windowed Timing
mode interruped by a 15 s exposure in Photon Counting mode because
of mode switching.

The Photon Counting mode image provides a source XRT position:

RA(J2000) = 05h 08m 27.27s
Dec(J2000) = +69d 44' 25.7"

with an uncertainty of 5.6 arcsec (90% containment). This position includes
the latest XRT boresight correction. This position is 2.4 arcmin from the
BAT position and 9 arcseconds from the candidate optical counterpart found
by Kann (GCN 4577).

The Windowed Timing light curve of this source shows an initial flat 
behaviour
followed by three bright flares after the first 100 s of observation.
A more detailed analysis will be distributed later.
