W. Fong, B. A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the field of the INTEGRAL short-duration GRB 131224A
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 15607) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA). We obtained two sets of 1-hour observations beginning on 2013 Dec
24.907 UT and 2013 Dec 26.971 UT (0.202 and 2.267 days post-burst,
respectively) at a mean frequency of 5.8 GHz. We find no evidence for
variability within the INTEGRAL error circle to a 3-sigma limit of 33
microJy at the time of the two observations.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
