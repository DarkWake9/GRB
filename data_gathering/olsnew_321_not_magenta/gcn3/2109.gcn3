TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2109
SUBJECT: GRB 030329: possible color change
DATE:    03/04/07 03:27:57 GMT
FROM:    Krzysztof Z. Stanek at CfA  <kstanek@cfa.harvard.edu>

D. Bersier, R. Schild and K. Z. Stanek (CfA) report:

We imaged the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price: GCN
1985; Torii: GCN 1986) with the FLWO 1.2-m telescope between April 5
UT 03:11 and April 6 UT 08:49 using standard BVRI filters. During that
time, the color of the OT seems to have changed by ~0.15 in B-V (OT
getting redder) and by ~0.1 in V-I (OT getting bluer). This seems to
be consistent with the supernova signature discovered by Matheson et
al. (GCN 2107).
