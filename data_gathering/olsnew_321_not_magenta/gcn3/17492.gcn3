E. Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 446348290/150223068
at 01:38:07.99 UT on the 23rd of February 2015, tentatively classified
as a GRB, is in fact not due to a GRB. This trigger is due to the
outburst from SGR 1935+2154. This is the third such burst that
triggered GBM since the outburst was detected by Swift BAT and
reported in Burrows et al. (GCN #17485). GBM observations will be
reported in more detail in an upcoming circular."
