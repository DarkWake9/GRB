Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150314A (trigger #634795)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 17573).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 126.661, 63.839 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  08h 26m 38.6s
  Dec(J2000) = +63d 50' 21.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 34%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single bright FRED pulse that starts at
~ T-2 s, peaks at ~T0, and ends at  ~T+13 s. There are some weak extended
emissions that last till ~ T+100 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 14.79 +- 2.64 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.17 to T+101.42 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.08 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 38.5 +- 0.9 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
