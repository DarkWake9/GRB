(HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI) and C. C. Thoene (HETH/IAA-CSIC) report:

We observed the  GRB 190829A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 25551; Dichiara et al.,
GCN 25552) with the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain.
The observation started at 05:29:50 UT on August 30, 2019 (t-t0 = 9.55 hours).
We obtained 5x60 seconds exposures in r'. We clearly detected the optical
afterglow inside the SWIFT error circle given of Evans et al. (GCN 25567).
We measure the following magnitude

r' = 19.79 +- 0.10 mag,

Magnitudes were derived from against comparison stars from the SDSS catalogue
and are in the AB system.
