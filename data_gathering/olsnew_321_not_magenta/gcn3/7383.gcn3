FROM:    Ryan Chornock at UC Berkeley  <chornock@astro.berkeley.edu>

[corrected UT time]

R. Chornock, R. J. Foley, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report that:

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory slewed to the
position of GRB 080310 and found a new source not present in the DSS:

14:40:13.81  -00:10:30.6

at about magnitude 17.  The new object is detected in V, I, and unfiltered
images starting at 08:40:01 UT.  We suggest it may be the afterglow of GRB
080310.
