MASTER OT J075043.33+790917.1 - new flare of QSO NVSS J075043+790917 = 
MASTER OT J075042.60+790918.2

MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka was starting survey on the FERMI  GRB141124A (GBM 
trigger  number 438503903 ) error-box   2286 sec after notice time and 
15886 sec after trigger time at 2014-11-24 11:03:07 UT.

During the inspection of the Fermi error box MASTER-Tunka
auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, 
Dec) = 07h 50m 43.33s +79d 09m 17.1s on 2014-11-24.62164 UT. The OT 
unfiltered magnitude is 17.5m (limit 18.4m). The OT is seen in 3 images. 
There is no minor planet at this place. We have reference image without OT 
on 2010-11-13.70064 UT with unfiltered magnitude limit 21.2m.

The OT is a new flare of quasar NVSS J075043+790917 that was previously 
detected by MASTER-Amur on 2013-04-26.694 UT as MASTER OT 
J075042.60+790918.2 (see ATel #5044, S. Shurpakov et al.). The object is 
marginally visible on the Blue Palomar plate with jmag=22.31 in GSC 2.3.2. 
There is an infrared counterpart AllWISE J075043.29+790917.1 
(W1=14.05+/-0.03 W2=13.01+/-0.03 W3=9.53+/-0.03 W4=7.20+/-0.09). This area 
of sky is not covered by SDSS and CRTS. Color-combined DSS finder chart is 
uploaded to http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/J075043+790917-BRIR.jpg 
(10'x10' FOV).

We note that in our previous observations of this field by MASTER-Tunka on 
2014-10-26.644 UT (by the coincidence, also during Fermi error box 
inspection for trigger number 436028617) the object was marginally 
detected at ~18.5m. Multi-wavelength follow up observations are required.
