team of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the localization of GRB 060130 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 4615)
with three of the PROMPT telescopes simultaneously in r'Iz' beginning 23.8
hours after the burst under the automated control of Skynet:

Filter  Telescope  Start (UT)  Stop (UT)  Exposures  Total (hr)
r'      PROMPT-4   04:45:52    06:34:20   71 x 80s   1.80
I       PROMPT-1   04:46:02    06:33:52   71 x 80s   1.78
z'      PROMPT-5   04:45:42    06:34:53   72 x 80s   1.82

No new source is found to I > 19.8 mag (3 sigma).  The magnitudes have
been calibrated to five USNO-B1.0 stars.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned at CTIO.
