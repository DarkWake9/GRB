We observed the Swift GRB 140419A field (Marshall et al., GCN 16118) using
1.04m ST telescope at ARIES Nainital. Observations were started at 14:44:38
UT on 2014-04-19 (approximately 10.6 h after the burst). Several frames
with an exposure time of 300 s each in R_c band were obtained in good sky
conditions.

The optical counterpart of GRB 140419A (Zheng et al., GCN 16119; Guver et
al., GCN 16120; Butler et al.,GCN 16121; Kuin et al., GCN 16123; Hentunen
et al., GCN 16126; Cenko et al., GCN 16129) is clearly detected  in each
individual frames. The preliminary photometry of the first frame is 19.8 +-
0.1 mag. The photometry was performed in comparison to nearby USNO stars.
