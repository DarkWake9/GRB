The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Livingston Observatory

(L1) data around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate

S190910h (GCN Circular 25707).

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new

sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via GCN Notice, is available

for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190910h

For the LALInference.fits.gz sky map, the 90% credible region is 24264

deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity

distance estimate is 230 +/- 88 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard

deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of

this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
