Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT detection of GRS 1716-249 (a.k.a. GRO J1719-24
and V2293 Oph; trigger #729410; Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 20352).
This source is currently having an outburst that was also detected
by MAXI/GSC (Negoro et al. ATEL #9876 and Masumitsu et al. ATEL #9895)
and the Swift/BAT transient monitor (see light curves
at http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/Granat1716-249/).

The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 259.915, -25.010 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 19m 39.7s
   Dec(J2000) = -25d 00' 35.0"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 35%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows that the emission lasts throughout the
duration when the source was in the BAT field of view from T-133 s to T+158 s.

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+112.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.50 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
