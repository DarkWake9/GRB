A. Cholden-Brown (PSU), J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

For an image beginning at 03:34:04 UT, BAT misidentified the
known source GRS 1716-249 as a different source
and incorrectly triggered an alert. 

This is due to a known race condition in the onboard software. 

The flux level of GRS 1716-249 in this detection is consistent
with recent observations of this source, which has been in outburst 
since December 2016 and has declined to ~40% of its peak value.
