report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB  
090708 (Swift trigger 356776; Krimm et al., GCN 9621), producing  
images beginning 7.4 s after the GCN notice time. An automated  
response took the first image at 03:39:04.5 UT, 49.2 s after the  
burst, under fair conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 10 60- 
sec exposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO  
A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the  
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle, for both single images and coadding  
into sets of 10. Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging  
from 14.8-16.1; we set the following specific limits.
