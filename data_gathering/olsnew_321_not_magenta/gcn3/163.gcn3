"We obtained a 600 s R-band image of the joint RXTE/IPN error region of
GRB 981220 (GCN 159,160) on the Palomar 5m telescope on Dec 23.15.
The limiting magnitude was about 22.7.  Preliminary analysis shows
no new object in comparison with the digitized POSS II plate to a limit
of R=20.5.  Our image is posted at
