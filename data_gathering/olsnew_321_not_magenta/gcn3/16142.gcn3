E. Sonbas (NASA/GSFC/Adiyaman Univ.), M. M. Chester (PSU),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. N. Ukwatta (MSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 08:31:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140423A (trigger=596901).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 197.290, +49.815 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 09m 10s
   Dec(J2000) = +49d 48' 52"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a multi-peak
structure with a duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~20 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+47.2
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Sonbas (edasonbas AT yahoo.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)

[GCN OPS NOTE(23apr14):  The second sentence was corrected to indicate
a delayed (not immediate) slew.]
