The long-duration GRB 180923A localized by MAXI/GSC (Maruyama et al., GCN
23257) and observed by CALET (GBM: Penacchioni et al., GCN 23259) was
detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows two episodes, started at ~T0(MAXI)-19 s
with a total duration of ~ 127 s.

As observed by KW, the burst had a fluence of
5.42(-0.65,+1.26)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(MAXI)+93.3 s, of 3.47(-0.92,+1.15)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1000 keV energy range).

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0(MAXI)-18.6 s to ~T0(MAXI)+108 s)
by a simple power-law model yields a power law
index of -2.2(-0.2,+0.2), chi2=0.2/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
