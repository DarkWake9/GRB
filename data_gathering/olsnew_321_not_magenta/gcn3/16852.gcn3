The long-duration GRB 140928A (Desiante et al., GCN Circ. 16847) has 
been observed by Fermi (GRB trigger 433592996; von Kienlin et al., GCN 
Circ. 16850), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), MESSENGER (GRNS), and 
Swift (BAT), so far, at about 37794 s UT (10:29:54). The burst was 
outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=14.055 deg (00h 56m 13s) Dec(2000)=+2.376 deg (+2d 22' 33"), 
whose radius is 63.085 +/- 0.902 deg (3 sigma) and to a  Konus-MESSENGER 
annulus centered at RA(2000)=26.945 deg (01h 47m 47s) Dec(2000)=+14.819 
deg (+14d 49' 08"), whose radius is 72.142 +/- 0.121 deg (3 sigma).

The Swift (XRT) source (Pagani et al., GCN Circ. 16848) is inside the 
annuli, at the distance between the source and the central line of the 
Konus-MESSENGER annulus of 17 arcsec.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming 
GCN Circular.
