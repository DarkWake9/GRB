BeppoSAX MAIL n. 99/21: GRB ALERT (GRB990806: Summer GRB)
Date: Aug.6, 1999,  16:28 UT


On Aug.6, 14:28:07 UT  a GRB (GRB990806) was detected
simultaneously by the GRBM and WFC of BeppoSAX (also BATSE trigger 7701).

The refined coordinates from WFC are:
R.A.(2000)  =  47.6479 degrees =  03h 10m 35.5s
Decl.(2000) = -68.1143 degrees = -68d 06' 51.4"
i.e. 0.4' from the previous preliminary position.
The error radius is 3'

We are planning a follow-up with NFI.
