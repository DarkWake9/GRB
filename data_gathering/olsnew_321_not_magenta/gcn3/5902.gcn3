GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed optical afterglow (Vanden Berk et al., GCN 5856) of GRB061126
(Sbarufatti et al, GCN 5854) with 1.5m telescope of  Maidanak observatory
(MAO).  Several exposures of 300 s in R-band were obtained on Nov. 26
between (UT) 19:11 - 23:44.  Preliminary photometry against USNO-A2.0 stars
of two combined images is following:

T0+ ,      Exposure,  R_mag

0.454 d    9x300     21.16 +/- 0.04
0.593 d   14x300     21.65 +/- 0.08

A local power law decay index of the afterglow in our observations between
0.454 and 0.593 days is -1.5 +/-0.13, which is differ from global power-law
decay index of -1.0 (+/- 0.1) between 0.54 and 1.76 days after the burst
reported early (Rol et al., GCN5876).
