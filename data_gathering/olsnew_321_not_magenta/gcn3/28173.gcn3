The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of GRB 200729A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/28165.gcn3) in a time window one hour in duration, beginning 10 minutes prior to the Swift BAT trigger (2020-07-29 19:28:05 UTC to 2020-07-29 20:28:05 UTC), during which IceCube was collecting good quality data.  Zero track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with GRB 200729A during this time period. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 5.5 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum are between approximately 1 TeV and 200 TeV.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.  The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>.
