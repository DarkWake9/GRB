TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1083
SUBJECT: BeppoSAX/GRBM detection of GRB010728
DATE:    01/07/30 16:56:05 GMT
FROM:    Marco Feroci at IAS/CNR Frascati  <feroci@ias.rm.cnr.it>

M. Feroci (IAS/CNR, Rome), C. Guidorzi (Univ. of Ferrara) and F. Frontera
(Univ. of Ferrara and ITESRE/CNR, Bologna), report on behalf of the
BeppoSAX
GRBM Team:

"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) was triggered by a gamma ray
burst on July 28, 2001, 19:24:45.028 UT (GRBM automatic alert n.265).
The event observed by the RXTE/ASM on the same day at 19:24:47.23 UT
(BACODINE notice on  30 July 2001, 16:06:22 UT) is therefore most likely
the same event. As seen by the GRBM in the 40-700 keV energy range, the
event was rather weak, showing a peak flux of about 240 counts/s, and
approximately 8 s long."
