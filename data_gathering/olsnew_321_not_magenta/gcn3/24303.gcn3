We used the 1m telescope at the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan to obtain
g- and r-band images of the transient found by Swift/UVOT (GCN 24296).
The observations started at 2019-04-27 19:30 UT and the exposure time is
300s for both filters. With a limiting magnitude of about 21.5 (AB) by
comparing to PS1 images, we do not detect the UVOT transient.
