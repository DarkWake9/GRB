S. Campana (INAF-OAB), T. Mineo (INAF-IASF PA),
P. Romano (INAF-OAB), G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB),
D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 051109B (trigger #163170, Tagliaferri
et al., GCN 4222) at 08:41:06 UT, but was unable to obtain an on-board
centroid. Analysis of the initial ground-processed data finds a faint
and uncataloged source at coordinates:
 
RA(J2000) = 23 01 50.35  
Dec(J2000) =+38 40 49.6
 
We estimate an uncertainty of 4 arcseconds (90% containment), including
corrections for the XRT boresight offset.  This position lies 60
arcseconds from the BAT position and at 74 arcsec from the
UVOT position, respectively, reported in GCN 4222.
