W. Landsman (GSFC/Adnet) and T. Sakamoto (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 101114A  
20.3 hrs after the BAT trigger (Sakamoto et al., GCN 11405). We do not 
detect any source at the enhanced Swift XRT position (Evans  GCN 11406, 
11415).  UVOT magnitude 3-sigma upper limits are reported in the 
following table:

Filter  T_start  T_stop  Exp(s)  Mag (3-sigma upper limit)
-------------------------------------------------------------
white     74084    86413   2325 > 21.9
v         74901    87330   2567 > 20.5
u         73267    91074   2822 > 21.0

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected 
Galactic extinction along the line of sight of E_(B-V) = 0.19 (Schlegel
et al. 1998).    All photometry is on the UVOT photometric system 
described  in Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).
