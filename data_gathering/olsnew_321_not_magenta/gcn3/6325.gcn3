B. Schmidt (ANU) and G. Mackie (Swinburne) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration

We have obtained R and I photometry of GRB070419B  (Parson et al. GCN 
6305) with the
ANU 1m telescope + WFI at Siding Spring observatory. I images taken Apr 
19.737-19.748  and R images taken at Apr 19.753-19.757  confirm the 
source of Tristram et al. (GCN 6312) at a position

    RA  (2000):   21:02:49.82
    DEC(2000):  -31:15:49.3

 with a position uncertainty +/- 0.1" referenced to the UCAC2 catalog.

The R and I magnitudes are estimate to be ~ I=20.7, R=22.1 referenced to 
the UCAC2/2Mass star
located at 21:02:59.34 -31:18:13.4 with mag ~I=14.75, R=15.25. This is 
significantly fainter than observed by Tristram et al., and suggests 
strongly that this object is associated with GRB07419B.
