D. Grupe, D.B. Fox, J. Racusin, J. Kennea, report on behalf of the Swift 
XRT team:

We have analyzed the first three orbits of Swift XRT data of GRB 061110B.
The X-ray position was determined from the XRT image using the new 
teldef file:

Ra(2000)   =  21 35 40.42
Dec(2000)  = +06 52 34.0

with an 4.2" error (90% confidence). This position is 2" away from the initial
position given by Kennea et al. (GCN 5805) and 0.1" away from the optical
position reported by Melandri et al. (GCN 5804).


The X-ray light curve can be fitted by a single power law decay slope
alpha=1.35+/0.10. The flux a 4ks after the burst was 2.4e-12 ergs/s/cm2. Our
prediction for the flux at 24h after the burst is 4.5e-14 ergs/s/cm2, or 
9e-4 XRT counts/s.

The spectral analysis shows a typical GRB afterglow spectrum with a power law
photon index Gamma=1.9+/-0.4. The absorption column density in consistent with
the Galactic value (4.83e20 cm-2).

[GCN OPS NOTE(11nov06): Per author's request, the Galactic NH was changed
from 4.83e21 to 4.83e20.  We thank A.Kann for pointing this out.]
