M. Uemura, R. Ishioka, T. Kato (Kyoto U.), C. Nakayama and H. Yamaoka
(Kyushu U.) report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

  "We observed the position of GRB 031220 (=H2976) starting at
Dec. 20.39 UT (6.0 hours after burst) with the 0.25-m telescope
(+unfiltered CCD) at Kyoto University.  The stacked image (32 x 30s,
during 09:43 - 10:07 UT) covers the central part (about 45%) of the
entire SXC error box.   Visual comparison of the stacked image to the
DSS 2 red image shows no new object down to a limiting magnitude of
about 17.8 (estimated with USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes of many field
stars).  

This message can be cited."
