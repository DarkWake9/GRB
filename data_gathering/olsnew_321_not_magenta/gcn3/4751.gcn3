Using a paritally downloaded data set from T-60 to T+123 sec
from a recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis
of BAT GRB 060211A (trigger #181126) (Hurkett, et al., GCN 4736).
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec = 58.361,+21.485 deg
{3h 53m 26.6s,+21d 29' 4.4"} (J2000) +- 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment).  The partial coding was 100%.
 
Using data from T-60 to +123, the lightcurve shows some very weak emission
starting at T_zero out to T+50, then the bulk of the emission is 
from T+50 to T+100 with weak emission extending out to T+123
where our downloaded data set currently ends.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 43 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+47.8 to T+97.1 is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.40 +- 0.64, 
and an Epeak of 94 +- 49 keV (chi squared 42 for 56 d.o.f.).  
For this model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
8.2 +- 0.8 x 10^-07 erg/cm2 and the 1-sec peak flux measured
from T+53.94 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.3 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  
A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index of 1.30 +- 0.14
(chi squared 49 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
