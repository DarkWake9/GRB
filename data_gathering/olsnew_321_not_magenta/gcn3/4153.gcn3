J. S. Bloom (UCB) reports:

"We observed the field of GRB051022 (GCN 4131; GCN 4137) with the  
PAIRITEL 1.3m starting at 2005-10-23 04:00:34 UTC. In a total  
exposure of 1836 seconds we detect in JHKs the three sources (A,B:  
Castro-Tirado et al. GCN 4143; C: Cool GCN 4149) near the XRT  
position (GCN 4141). We note that only source B is consistent with  
the current XRT position.  An image has been posted to:

position marked as a white circle)

Further observations are planned."
