TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3361
SUBJECT: GRB 050416b:Swift XRT afterglow upper limits
DATE:    05/05/06 00:33:54 GMT
FROM:    David Burrows at PSU/Swift  <dxb15@psu.edu>

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 22:35:54 UT on 16th April 2005 
(Hullinger et al., GCN 3279). Due to the close proximity of this burst to 
the moon, the observatory did not execute an automated slew at that time. 
This burst became visible to Swift Narrow Field Instruments at 12:48:00 UT 
on 20th April 2005 (i.e. 86.3 hours after the trigger), and was observed by 
Swift-XRT as a pre-planned target on 20th April, 22nd April, and 1st May 
2005.  Five uncataloged sources are detected within the BAT error 
circle(Sato et al., GCN Circ 3284), but none of them is fading. The source 
previously indicated as a tentative afterglow candidate in GCN 3295 (Kennea 
et al.) is stable within errors.  Thus we cannot identify any afterglow for 
this GRB. We estimate 3 sigma upper limits of 2E-14, 1.7E-14, and 1.5E-14 
erg/cm2/s for the flux of the GRB afterglow in the first, second and third 
observations, respectively.
