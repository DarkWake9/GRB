E. O. Ofek, Y. M., Lipkin, J. Dann (Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the Swift error box of GRB050922C
(Norris et al. GCN 4013) using the Wise observatory 1m
telescope starting at 2005, Sep 22nd, 22:10:56 UTC.
We obtained a 210 sec unfiltered image (mid exposure
time 0.0950 days after the Swift-BAT trigger) in which
we detected the optical transient (OT) discovered by
Rykoff et al. (GCN 4011).
At that epoch, the OT magnitude was R~17.9, assuming
R-mag=14.24 for the bright star 37 arcsec at PA=210deg
from the OT.
