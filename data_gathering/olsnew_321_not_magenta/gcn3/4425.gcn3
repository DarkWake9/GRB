Using the data set from T-119.9 to T+248.2 sec from the recent 
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060102 
(trigger #175603)  (Retter, et al., GCN 4423).  
The BAT ground-calculated  position is 
(RA,Dec) = 328.834, -1.838 {21h 55m 20.3s, -1d 50' 17.8"} [deg; J2000] 
+- 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 89 %.  

The BAT light curve shows a single peak of about three seconds followed 
by the small bump at T+16 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is (21 +- 2) sec 
(estimated error including systematics).  
 
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.19 +- 0.38. 
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (2.4 +- 0.5) x 10^-07 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.72 sec in the 15-150 keV 
band is (0.4 +- 0.1) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% 
confidence level.  

A data glitch caused the original GCN Notices to go out with 
the wrong burst trigger time (02:45:43 instead of 21:17:28 UT). 
This was not realized during the first circular (#4423), 
but was corrected in circular 4424.
