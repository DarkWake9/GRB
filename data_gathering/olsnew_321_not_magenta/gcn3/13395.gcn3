A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), P. D'Avanzo (OaB/INAF), 
S. Campana (OaB/INAF), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), S. Covino (OaB/INAF), 
J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), and C.C. Thoene (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration,

In light of the recent XRT observation (Littlejohns et al., GCN13394) we 
have performed further analysis of the HAWKI data reported by D'Avanzo 
et al. (GCN 13391). Within the error circle of the XRT source  we detect a 
point-like source and a galaxy at the following coordinates (J2000 +/- 0.3"):

Galaxy 1A (RA, Dec): 11:23:32.08, +08:55:44.7
Point-like 1B (RA, Dec): 11:23:32.30, +08:55:42.5

We have performed image subtraction between our two K-band observations 
and we detect no variability of any of these sources between the two epochs.

We also note that the galaxy is well detected in the SDSS with r=21.46 and a 
has a photometric redshift of 0.57+/-0.07.

Our observations also cover the second XRT source that lies slightly outside 
the BAT error circle. Within this region we detect 2 extended sources, with 
coordinates (J2000 +/- 0.3"):

Galaxy 2 (RA, Dec): 11:23:28.17, +08:55:57.6
Galaxy 3 (RA, Dec): 11:23:28.07, +08:55:56.8

Again, no variability is found within the second XRT position. These are detected 
as a single source in SDSS at r=21.55 and a photometric redshift of 0.43+/-0.07.
