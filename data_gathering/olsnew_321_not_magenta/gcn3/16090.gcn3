Using the data set from T-180 to T+902 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140408A (trigger #595141)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 16082).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 290.723, -12.585 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 22m 53.5s
   Dec(J2000) = -12d 35' 07.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 40%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure starts at ~T-1 sec,
peaks at ~ T+1 sec, and ends at ~T+4 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 4.00 +- 1.41 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.66 to T+3.34 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.34 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
