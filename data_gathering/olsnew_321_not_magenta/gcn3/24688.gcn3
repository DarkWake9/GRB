We began to observe GRB 190530A (Fermi-GBM team, GCN 24676 ) with GWAC-F30cm telescope 
at 2019-05-30T12:48:46(UT), about 2.49 hour after the burst. GWAC-F30cm telescope is located at Xinglong
observatory, China. The field of view is about 1.9*1.9 sqr. deg. The coordinates  we used to make the 
observations was derived from  Biltzinger et al., (GCN 24677). Due to the low elevation of this source
at Xinglong observatory,  only seven R-band images were obtained. The exposure time for each frame
was 20 seconds. 

The afterglow was detected by stacking all the images. 
The coordinates is about RA=08:02:07.678  DEC=+35:28:47.14 J2000,
consistent with the position reported by Lipunov et al., GCN 24680. 
The magnitude was R=15.1mag, calibrated by the nearby USNO R2 magnitudes.
