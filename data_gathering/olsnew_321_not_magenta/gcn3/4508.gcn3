TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4508
SUBJECT: GRB 060114: Swift XRT upper limit
DATE:    06/01/15 00:01:47 GMT

M. Perri (ASDC), G. Tagliaferri (OAB) and D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift observatory executed a Target of Opportunity observation
of the INTEGRAL discovered GRB 060114 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 4505).
The XRT began taking data at 19:51:49 UT, approximately 7.2 hours after
the trigger. In an XRT exposure of ~2 ks we did not find an X-ray
counterpart at the INTEGRAL position reported in Shaw et al. (GCN 4506).

We estimate a three sigma upper limit of 8.6e-3 cts/s corresponding to
a 0.3-10 keV flux of about 5e-13 erg/cm2/s.

No further Swift observations are planned.
