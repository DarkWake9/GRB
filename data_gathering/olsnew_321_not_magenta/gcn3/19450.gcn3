The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160313A (D'Ai et al., GCN 19171) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 13.15, Mar 13.97, Mar 
16.00, Mar 20.11, and Mar 23.02 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Goad et al., GCN 19174), with 3sigma upper limits of 
130 uJy, 60 uJy, 100 uJy, 170 uJy, and 70 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
