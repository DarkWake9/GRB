We followed up the GraceDB event (event ID: G211117) with Nanshan One-meter Wide field Telescope (NOWT) from Xinjiang Astronomical observatory (XAO). The first observation was observed at UTC 2016:01:21:20:06:20. The first observation reached an exposure time of 100 seconds with V band and approached a limiting magnitude of 19.6 magnitude with a non-detection of EM-trigger during 2 hrs lasting observation.  We only report the first observation here, more information will be reported with below.


We monitored the sky region constantly since the event, and we anticipated to continue the observation for time-dominant astronomy. Analysis is ongoing, we observed the northern sky range:
