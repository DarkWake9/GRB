K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:52:11 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150211A (trigger=630714).  Swift did not slew because of observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 254.856, +55.383, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 59m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = +55d 22' 59"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several overlapping peaks
structure with a total duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+33.7
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

The star tracker lost lock about 1 minute before the trigger,
but the location should be good by propagating the gyros.  INTEGRAL-SPIACS
also saw this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is R. L. C. Starling (rlcs1 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
