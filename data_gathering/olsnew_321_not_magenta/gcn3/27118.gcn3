Eric C. Bellm (UW) and Melissa Graham (UW) report on behalf of the GROWTH
collaboration:

On 2020-02-15 02:23 we imaged the location of ZTF20aanakes/AT2020cly
(Coughlin et al, GCN #27095), a transient located inside the error region
of S200213t (LVC,GCN #27042), using the Astrophysical Research Consortium
Telescope Imaging Camera (ARCTIC) on the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m.

We obtained 120-second exposures in g, r, and i bands.  We do not detect
the transient in any band; we estimate two-sigma detection limits of m_g ~
23.5 mag, m_r ~ 23.0 mag, and m_i ~ 21.5 mag.

We thank the APO staff for their support of this Target of Opportunity
observation.
