E. Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:36:30.73 UT on 23 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140723A (trigger 427772193 / 140723067).
It was also detected by Fermi LAT (Bissaldi et al. 2014, GCN 16623).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 56 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.002 s
to T0+56.801 s is well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.1 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 968 +/- 231 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.46 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.000 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.8 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
