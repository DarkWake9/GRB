We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 21106) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/05 19.22 to 2017/05 19.32 UTC (1.8
minutes to 2.44 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.41
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.60 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

The optical transient (GCN 21106; Izzo, et al., GCN 21108) is clearly
detected.  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain:

  r 16.72 +/- 0.01
  i 16.50 +/- 0.01
  Z 16.34 +/- 0.01
  Y 16.25 +/- 0.01
  J 16.15 +/- 0.01
  H 15.87 +/- 0.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The lightcurve rises in all bands
initially, peaking at i~16 at about 15 minutes after the GRB trigger, then
fading as t^(-0.8).

Mártir.
