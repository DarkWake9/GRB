Using the data set from T-239 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061202 (trigger #241963)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 5886).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 105.180, -74.587 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 00m 43.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -74d 35' 12.5" 
with an uncertainty of 5.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows that it started with low-level emission
at ~T-95 sec, then BAT triggered on a small peak at T+0 sec which returned
to instrumental background level at ~T+20 sec.  Then some low level emission
starting at ~T+45 sec, then a much larger FRED peak started at ~T+70 sec,
peaking at T+75 sec, and ending at T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 91 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+147.4 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+75.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
