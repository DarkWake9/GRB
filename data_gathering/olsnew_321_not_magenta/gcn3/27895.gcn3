K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

We are notified that a previous flare from 1RXS J1708âˆ’4009,
was actually detected by NuSTAR in 2018 (Younes et al. 2020,
ApJ, 889, L27).

We also note that a magnetar like burst has previously reported
from this source by Archibald et al. (ATEL #10107).

Therefore, previous statement of "no previous bursts reported in
the literature by other instruments" in GCN 27886/ATEL 13780 is
incorrect.

We thank George Younes and Sergio Campana for sharing this info
and we apologize for missing these articles in previous search.
