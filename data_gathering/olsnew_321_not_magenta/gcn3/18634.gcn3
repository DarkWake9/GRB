Using the data set from T-120 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of an outburst from SGR J1819-1600  (trigger #664624)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 18632).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 274.714, -15.981 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 18m 51.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 58' 52.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at T_zero.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.032 +- 0.14 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.000 to T+0.032 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.93 +- 0.38.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.4 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.8 +- 1.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
