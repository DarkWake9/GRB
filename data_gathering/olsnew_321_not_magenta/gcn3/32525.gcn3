The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:05:26 UT on 7 Sep 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220907A (trigger 684252331.480966 / 220907587).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 269.6, Dec = -18.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 58m, -18d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75.0 degrees.
