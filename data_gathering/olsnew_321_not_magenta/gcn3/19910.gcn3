P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Due to technical issues, GCN 19905 was issues with an incorrect encoding 
and GCN 19906 was contained the wrong name and URL.

Swift-XRT observed the field of GRB 160910A and discovered an afterglow 
as reported by D'Ai et al (GCN Circ. 19904). As the afterglow has been 
detected, the full XRT results for the GRB are available at
