We observed the field of GRB 150120B (D'Elia, et al., GCN 17314) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/01 21.09 to 2015/01 21.29 UTC (18.73 to
23.64 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.91 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source coincident with the GROND optical transient (Wiseman et al.,
GCN 17336), in comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the following detections
and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r = 23.4 +/- 0.2
  i = 22.6 +/- 0.1
  z > 20.72

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
