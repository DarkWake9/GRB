TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  28832
SUBJECT: GRB 201104A: Tiled Swift observations

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has initiated a series of observations, tiled on the sky, of the
Fermi/LAT GRB 201104A. Automated analysis of the XRT data will
be presented online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00094

Any uncatalogued X-ray sources detected in this analysis will be
reported on this website and via GCN COUNTERPART notices. The probability of finding
serendipitous sources, unrelated to the Fermi/LAT event is high: any X-ray source
considered to be a probable afterglow candidate will be reported via a GCN Circular
after manual consideration.

Details of the XRT automated analysis methods are detailed in Evans et
al. (2007, A&A, 469, 379; 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177 and 2014, ApJS, 210, 8).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.

[GCN OPS NOTE(06Nov20): Due to the uncertainty of the arrival time with respect 
to the downtime window (15 hours) of the GCN Circulars processing system, 
the error in the date-time in the header of this Circular can be off anywhere from 0-15 hours.]
