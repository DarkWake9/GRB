C. Clemens, A. Updike (Clemson University), T. Kruehler, J. Greiner, A. Kupcu 
Yoldas, A. Yoldas (all MPE Garching) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest 
and MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080613B (Swift trigger 313954; Markwardt et al., 
GCN #7873) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, 
PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory 
(Chile).

Observations started at 22:47 UT on June 13th, 2008, 11.6 hrs after the GRB 
trigger.

We do not detect any object within the refined 3.6'' Swift-XRT error circle 
reported by Mao et al. (GCN #7875) to the following 3-sigma upper limits:

g' > 24.4,
r' > 24.4,
i' > 23.5,
z' > 23.5 and
J > 22.4.

Given upper limits are calibrated against USNO-B1 as well as 2MASS field 
stars.
