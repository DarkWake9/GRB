A. S. Moskvitin, T. A. Fatkhullin (SAO RAS, Russia) and I. Soloviev
(Saint-Petersburg Univ.), report on behalf of the larger team.

We observed the field of the GRB 160804A (Marshall et al., GCN 19761)
with the BTA, 6-meter telescope of SAO RAS, equipped with the
Scorpio-I at 2016.08.04 17:52 UT (16.3 hours after the detection).

A couple of Rc-band images (30 and 180 sec.) were obtained.
The GRB OT (Breeveld & Marshall, GCN 19764; Tyurina et al., GCN 19768)
is clearly detected in the stacked frame. The brightness of the object
is R = 20.5 +/- 0.1 (calibration was done by the nearby SDSS stars,
and Lupton 2005 transformation equations).
