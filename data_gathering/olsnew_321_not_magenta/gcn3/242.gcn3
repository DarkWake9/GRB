 report on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We imaged the field of GRB 990123 in the R band on Jan. 30.52 using the
 MDM Observatory 2.4m telescope.  A total of 40 minutes exposure was
 obtained in seeing of 0.9-1.0 arcsec.  The optical transient is clearly
 detected at magnitude R = 23.01 +/- 0.24 (referenced to the comparison 
 star of GCN #207, assuming r - R = 0.4).  An independent calibration
 using a Landolt standard also gives a consistent magnitude.  The OT 
 position, measured with respect to the USNO-A2.0 reference system,
 is (J2000) RA 15:25:30.34, Dec +44:45:59.2 with an uncertainty of
 0.3 arcseconds in radius.  This position is consistent with that of the
 original detection of the OT (GCN #206).  The temporal power-law decay 
 slope connecting our observation to the first Palomar detection is 
 alpha_r = -1.15 +/- 0.07, consistent with all previous observations,
 which gave alpha_r = -1.13 +/- 0.03 (GCN #240).

 Thus, the OT appears to be unresolved, at a fixed position, and following
 a power-law decay in time.

 However, we see no object corresponding to a suggested intervening
 galaxy that was estimated to lie 1.8 arcsec north of the OT (GCN #206).
 In fact, there is no other object on our image within 5 arcsec of the
 OT, to a limiting magnitude of approximately R = 24.  Since this galaxy
 was only reported to be seen marginally on one POSS II red plate with
 R = 21.5 +/- 0.5 (GCN #213), we conclude that it probably does not
 exist.  If true, this eliminates one of the arguments for hypothesizing
 that the burst is lensed."
