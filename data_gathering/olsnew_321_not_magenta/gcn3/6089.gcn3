report:

A  very bright long hard GRB was observed at 2007-02-07 21:00:44 UT
by Konus-Wind, Swift-BAT, INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, Suzaku-WAM, and Konus-A.
The Swift satellite was slewing to a new pre-planned target at the time 
of the burst so the BAT did not trigger and was not able to provide a 
position for the burst. This burst was not observed by Odyssey, probably 
due to Mars-occultation. RHESSI and Ulysses were off.

The burst started with a short precursor (with a duration of ~0.05 sec),
followed by a main episode of emission which shows steep rise
and many sharp peaks, which transformed at T-T0 ~18 s to a smooth tail
seen up to T-T0 ~70 s.

It was triangulated to two annuli, whose coordinates are
RA, Dec, Radius =
296.570 (19h 46m 17s), -20.358 (-20d 21' 27"),
70.549 +/- 0.071,
and
299.695 (19h 58m 47s), -23.210 (-23d 12' 35")
66.501 +/- 0.178 degrees (3 sigma) .

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -46 and -30 degrees.

Combining all these data, we have triangulated
this burst to a single error box, whose corners are:

     RA, deg                  Dec, deg
1: 16.578 (01h 06m 19s)   -34.714 (-34d 42' 49")
2: 14.860 (00h 59m 26s)   -28.754 (-28d 45' 13")
3: 18.478 (01h 13m 55s)   -43.139 (-43d 08' 19")
4: 18.655 (01h 14m 37s)   -43.055 (-43d 03' 18")

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a 20 keV-10 MeV
fluence of ~3x10^-4 erg/cm2, and a hard
time-integrated spectrum with an Epeak ~2 MeV.

Detailed spectral parameters will be reported later.
