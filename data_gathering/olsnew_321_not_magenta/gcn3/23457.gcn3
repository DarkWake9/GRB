"At 09:54:09.94 UT on 26 November 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 181126A (trigger 564918854/ 181126413),
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Sonbas et al. 2018, GCN 23453).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi-LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 111 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of bright single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.1 s to T0+0.4 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 90 +/- 25 keV,
alpha = -0.1 +/- 0.6, and beta = -2.1 +/- 0.2.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.5)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-64 ms in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.5 +/- 1.7 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
