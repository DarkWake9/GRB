Elisabetta Bissaldi (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 07:54:02.48 UT on 03 July 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090703 (trigger 268300444 / 090703329).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, 
is RA =  0.8, DEC = 9.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 
00h 03m, 09d 42'), with an uncertainty of 5.3 degrees 
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is 
additionally a systematic error which is currently 
estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 9 s (8-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.6 s to T0+6.7 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with
index -1.72 +/- 0.06 (Castor C-stat 232 for 240 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.8 +/- 0.2)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 in the 8-1000 keV band is 1.00 +/- 0.10 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
