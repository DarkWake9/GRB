j. Wang, J.S. Deng and J.Y. Hu on behalf of EAFON report:

We have observed GRB090323 (Ohno et al.GCN 9021;
Updike et al.GCN 9026; Cenko et al. GCN 9027) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope from Mar.24,14:51:14(UT), 
38.8 hr after the burst. After combined 10*600s R 
band images, the optical afterglow was detected about 
R=20.55 mag at the mean time of 1.651 days after the 
trigger, with the same calibration star 
(RA = 12 42 39.3, Dec. = +17 05 05.7, Rc=17.15) 
of kann et al., (GCN 9033).
 
Further observation is suggested,
for the late slowly decay of the optical afterglow.
