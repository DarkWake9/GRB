and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 171010B (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 21995).
The observations now extend from T0+91.1 ks to T0+614.5 ks. 

Of the sources reported by Sbarufatti et al. (GCN Circ. 22009), "Source
2" is  believed to be the afterglow.  The position of this source is
RA, Dec=34.1342, -54.3915 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 02:16:32.20
Dec(J2000): -54:23:29.2

with an uncertainty of 5.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 71 arcsec from the Swift/BAT position. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.8 (+0.6, -0.4).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
