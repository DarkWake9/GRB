E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Konus and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 29758 s.
Its duration was about 2 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)= 279.607, -31.564 degrees,
whose radius is 45.210 +/-  7.921 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition,
the Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl = 210, -54 and
215, -34 degrees, and between 319, -57 and 341, -28 degrees.

This localization may be improved, but a small error box cannot
be obtained for this burst.
