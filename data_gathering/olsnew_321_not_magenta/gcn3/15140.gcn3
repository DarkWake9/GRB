C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) on behalf of
a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescopes North and South automatically began observing 
GRB
130831A (Hagen et al. GCN Circ. 15139) on August 31 2013 at 13:09:01 UT
(~4.7 min after the burst trigger).

We clearly detect the fading optical afterglow reported by Swift/UVOT
with R=14.1 +- 0.1 mag at 4.75 minutes since the BAT trigger time,
calibrated against nearby USNOB-1 catalogue stars.
