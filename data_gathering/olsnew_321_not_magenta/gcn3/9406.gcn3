Using the data set from T-119 to T+276 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090519 (trigger #352648)
(Perri, et al., GCN Circ. 9400).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 142.317, 0.190 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 29m 16.2s
   Dec(J2000) = +00d 11' 23.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
This is 0.8 arcmin from the enhanced XRT afterglow position (Goad et al.
GCN Circ #9405).  The partial coding was 57%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows multiple overlapping peaks starting 
at about T-17 sec and ending about T+95 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 
64 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.4 to T+60.4 sec is best fit by a 
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.02 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
1.2 +- 0.1 x 10-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T-10 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
