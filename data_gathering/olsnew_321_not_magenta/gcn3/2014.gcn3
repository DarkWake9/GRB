TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2014
SUBJECT: GRB 030329: Radio Observations 
DATE:    03/03/30 03:35:26 GMT
FROM:    Edo Berger at Caltech  <ejb@astro.caltech.edu>

E. Berger, A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the optical afterglow (GCN 1985) of GRB
030329 (GCN 1997) with the VLA on March 30.06 UT.  We detect a 3.5 mJy
source at 8.46 GHz coincident with the OT.  This is the brightest radio
afterglow detected to date, consistent with the unusual brightness of the
optical (e.g. GCNs 1986 & 1987) and X-ray (GCN 1996) counterparts, as well
as the prompt emission (GCN 1997)"
