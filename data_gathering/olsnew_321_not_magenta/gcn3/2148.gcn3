(RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the error-circle of HETE trigger #2686 (GRB 030418) with
the Siding Spring Observatory 40-inch telescope + Direct Imager.  Our
observations consisted of 5x300 sec exposures in R-band, commencing at
April 18.51 UT.  We identify in our images a source not present on the
DSS2 F or N plates.  The source has no apparent proper motion between
our images, and is located at:

	RA: 10:54:33.69   Dec: -7:01:40.8   J2000

with an estimated error of 0.5 arcsec.  We estimate that the source was 
R ~ 18.8 mag at the time of our observations.

Further observations are planned.
