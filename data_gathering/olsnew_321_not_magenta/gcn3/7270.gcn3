report:

We have observed field of the GRB080207 (trigger=302728, GCN Circ. 7264) 
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope  (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK 
National Observatory, Turkey) 07 Feb between 22:04UT and 22:27UT, i.e. 
starting about 34 min after the burst, using ANDOR CCD.

Series of 20*30sec direct images in Rc band were taken. We found no 
afterglow candidate inside of XRT error circle. Using USNO-B1 stars we 
estimated limiting magnitude of the co-added frame as R~21.8 mag.
