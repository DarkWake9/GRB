MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Argentina (OAFA observatory of San Juan National University)
started inspect of the ICECUBE Alert 220317A (The IceCube Collaboration GCN 31762, trigger No 11435033,10h 22m 57.60s , +11d 11m 24.0s, R=1.59)errorbox
18 sec after notice time (90 sec after trigger time) at 2022-03-17 02:33:47 UT, with upper limit up to  14.4 mag.
The observations began at zenith distance = 44 deg. The sun  altitude  is -45.2 deg.

The distance to full Moon was 8 degrees (Lunar disk: 0.98).

MASTER-OAGH robotic telescope  located in Mexico (OAGH National Institute  for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics) started inspect of the
ICECUBE-220317A alert errorbox  173 sec after notice time and 244 sec after trigger time at 2022-03-17 02:36:22 UT, with upper limit up to  16.4 mag. 
Observations started at twilight at zenith distance = 52 deg. The sun  altitude was -15.5 deg.

The galactic latitude b = 52 deg., longitude l = 231 deg.

We obtain a following upper limits at first images:

We didn't detect bright outburst of 4FGL J1018.9+1043 at wide-field alert images, but we detected
outburst in MASTER archive data at 2011-03-24 13:05:05UT with unfiltered m_BLA = 18.9m.

The analysis of wide-field and very wide field MASTER images and 
observations will be continued.
Additional observations are planned.
