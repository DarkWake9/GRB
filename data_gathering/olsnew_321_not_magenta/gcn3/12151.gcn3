Parra and C. Agurto (ESO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 110709B (Cummings et al. GCN 12122)
using LABOCA/APEX at Chajnantor (Chile) in the 870 micrometer band.
Observations  began on July 11 2011 at 21:31 UT (2.00 days after the
burst), with an on source  time of 106 min and PWV of 0.8mm. We used the
photometric mode, centred at the refined XRT position (Beardmore et al.
GCN 12136).

Initial data reduction, using CRUSH and BoA does no not detect any
significant emission, obtaining a formal flux on the source position of
1.4+/-2.3mJy (3-sigma limit of 6.9mJy).

We acknowledge the effort done by the APEX staff to get the telescope back
into operations after a 3m snow fall at Chajnantor.
