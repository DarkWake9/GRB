collaboration report:

We used public data of SPI-ACS to perform a search for possible 
EM-counterpart of LIGO/Virgo S190602aq.   Before and after trigger time of 
S190602aq we did not find any significant candidate (at the level more than 
3 sigma) in time scales from 0.05 s up to 100 s.

The angle between the center of the error box of the S190602aq localization 
by LIGO/Virgo and the SPI  axis is 129  degrees, and the region of the LIGO 
probability is not occulted by the Earth.

The 3 sigma upper limits in the energy range of 75 - 1000 keV are 1.2 * 
10^-7 erg/cm2   (1 s time scale), and 1.2 * 10^-6 erg/cm2  (100 s time 
scale).
