We observed the field of GRB 150211A (Starling, et al., GCN 17434)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from
2015/02 11.50 to 2015/02 11.53 UTC (0.05 to 1.29 hours after the
BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours exposure in the r, i
and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Campana, et al.,
GCN 17435), in comparison with USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we obtain the
following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 23.34
  i     > 23.71
  z     > 20.21

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB. These upper
limits are consistent with observations by the Swift-UVOT (Chester,
et al, GCN 17436) and MASTER II robotic telescope (Ivanov, et al,
GCN 17433).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
