on behalf of an east Asian collaboration report:
 
" We have carried out R-band imaging observation for the entire
INTEGRAL error region (S. Mereghetti et al., GCN 2805) at Kiso
observatory. We have obtained totally 9 R-band images with 300 sec
exposures started at 15.558 UT (0.103 days after the burst, Mizuno et
al., GCN2806) and 15.782 UT (0.327 days after the burst). Comparing
with two epoch our data, there is no variable source down to R~
21.9. The upper limit is estimated from several USNO-B1.0 catalogue
stars."
