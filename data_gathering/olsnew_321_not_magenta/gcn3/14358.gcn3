SUBJECT: GRB 130211A: Retraction of afterglow candidate

V. Sudilovsky and J. Greiner (both MPE Garching) report on behalf of the 
GROND
team:

Based on follow-up observations taken on 2013-03-29 (T+47 days after the 
initial
Swift trigger 548276; Oates et al., GCN 14195) of the source reported in GCN
14196, we retract our classification of this object. Since there is no
significant time variability associated with this source, we conclude 
that it
cannot be the afterglow of GRB 130211A.

The final magnitudes of this source (all AB) are:

g' > 24.0 mag,
r' = 23.5 +/- 0.1 mag,
i' = 22.3 +/- 0.1 mag,
z' = 21.7 +/- 0.1 mag,
J = 20.9 +/- 0.2 mag,
H = 20.5 +/- 0.2 mag, and
K > 20.2 mag.

We note that the large r'-i' color is consistent with the 4000 Angstrom 
break
expected from a galaxy at z~0.8. However, we caution that at this time 
there are
not enough data to make a definitive statement about this source.

Given magnitudes are calibrated against GROND zeropoints (g'r'i'z') as 
well as
2MASS field stars (JHK) and are not corrected for the expected Galactic
foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.53 mag 
in the
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
