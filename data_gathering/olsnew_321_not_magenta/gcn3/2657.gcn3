P.A. Price (IfA, University of Hawaii) and R. McNaught (MSO) report:

We have observed the error circle of GRB 040825 with the SSO 40-inch
telescope.  We obtained a single 300 sec exposure in R band at 2004 Aug
25.778 UT (2.3 hours after the GRB), covering the entire error circle
apart from 1 arcmin on the extreme Eastern edge.  The limiting magnitude
of our image is R ~ 19.8 mag, from comparison with the USNO-A2.0
catalogue.

Upon manual comparison with the DSS2 F plate, we do not find any
afterglow candidate to the limiting magnitude of our image.
