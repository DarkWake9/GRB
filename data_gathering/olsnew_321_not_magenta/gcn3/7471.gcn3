Y. Urata, K.Y. Huang, C.Y. Shih, T.W. Chen, M. Im, I. Lee,
on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have monitored the GRB 080319B optical afterglow using Lulin 1-m
telescope with B, V, R, I and z' bands from 16:18 to 21:19 (UT).
Comparing with former observations made by the LOAO (Urata et al. GCN
7435), the R and I band light curves show an apparent temporal break
again at ~0.2 days after the burst. The decay index of the post-break
is ~-0.8."
