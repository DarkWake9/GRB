P.A. Evans, A.P. Beardmore, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 2.1 ks of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT images for the 
recent BAT trigger on SGR 1617-5103 (trigger 700791, GCN Circs. 19547, 
19548, 19550) we have produced an enhanced XRT position (using the 
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 
catalogue) of: RA, Dec= 244.40105, -51.04011, which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  16h 17m 36.25s
Dec (J2000): -51d 02' 24.4"

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (90% confidence). This position is 
5.2" from the position reported in GCN Circ. 19548, and 0.6" from the 
Chandra position of the central source of RCW103 given in IAU Circ. 7350.

Note that there was a typo in GCN Circ. 19548; the decimal position was 
correct but the minus sign was missing from the sexagesimal declination.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
