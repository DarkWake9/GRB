Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190219A (trigger #889748)
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 23902).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 189.686, 76.606 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 38m 44.7s
  Dec(J2000) = +76d 36' 21.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~ T-110 s and ends at ~T+100 s. The first major pulse starts at ~T-5 s,
peaks at ~T+5 s, and end at ~T+40 s. It is followed by the second major pulse
that peaks at ~T+65 s and ends at ~T+90 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 167.8 +- 12.8 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-106.20 to T+88.68 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.24 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+65.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
