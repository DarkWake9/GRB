The long GRB 060901 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 5491, 5493)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=67439.385 s UT (18:43:59.385).

The Konus-Wind light curve  shows a single pulse
with a duration of ~8 sec,
followed by a weak tail seen up to T-T0 ~15 sec.

The spectrum of the pulse
(accumulated from T-T0=0 to T-T0=7.936 sec)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.77(-0.23, +0.26),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.31(-0.36, +0.18),
the break energy E0 = 156(-46, +71) keV (chi2 = 48/61 dof).
The peak energy Ep = 191(-30, +40) keV.

The burst total fluence is 1.51(-0.19,+0.14)x10^-5 erg/cm2
and peak flux on 256-ms time scale measured from T-T0=2.496 sec
3.06(-0.61, +0.54)x10^-6 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
