MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru)
responded to GRB060926 (Holland  et al., GCN Circ 5612).
The first image was started at 2006-09-26 16:49:57 UT, 76 s  after the GRB 
time.
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
The robot did not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  17.0 
(s/n=10).
The reduction is continuing.
This work is supported by RFFI  04-02-16411 grant.
