T. Ishimura, Y. Yatsu, T. Shimokawabe, N. Vasquez, and N. Kawai (Tokyo
Tech) report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the error box of GRB061019 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 5728)
with the 50cm MITSuME Telescope at Akeno, Japan on Oct 19 between
13:43:36 and 16:05:31 UT, starting 9.4 hours after the trigger.   
In the combined images (30s x 165) of I and R bands, we do not detect
any new source within the XRT error box.  The 3-sigma limiting
magnitudes based on USNO-B1.0 (I-band) and NOMAD (R-band) stars are
I=18.7 and R=19.5 respectively.
