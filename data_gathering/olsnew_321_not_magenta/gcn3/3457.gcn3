Derek B. Fox, S. Bradley Cenko, Kevin Bundy, Chris Conselice (Caltech) and
Paul Price (IfA) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

We have again imaged the field of XRF 050522 (Gotz et al, GCN 3446) with
the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) mounted on the 200-inch Palomar
Hale Telescope.  Observations consisted of 15 images in the Ks band for a
total integration time of 30 minutes.  The mean epoch of our observations
is approximately 3:45 UT 23 May (~ 21.8 hours after the burst).

Digital subtraction reveals no significantly variable sources in the
Integral error circle.  The limiting magnitude of our observations,
estimated by comparison with several 2MASS sources in the field, is
approximately Ks ~ 18.5.
