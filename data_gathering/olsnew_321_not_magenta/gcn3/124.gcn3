Elia Leibowitz and Peter Ibbetson, Wise Observatory, Tel Aviv University,
Israel report:

Using the Wise Observatory 1-m telescope and the observatory Tectronix CCD
camera, we obtained on May 20 a 1800 sec exposure of GRB980519, through a B
filter.  The time of mid-exposure is  01:22:11 UT.  The image of the optical
counterpart is at the limit of detectability.  Applying the DAOPHOT
photometry package we measured the instrumental magnitude of the counterpart
and of nearby stars.  Based on the B calibration of stars C and D of Henden
et al. (GCN Circ. #96), we estimate the B magnitude of the optical counterpart
as 20.95 +/- 0.25 mag.
