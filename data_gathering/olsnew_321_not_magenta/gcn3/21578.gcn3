We construct a preliminary UV/Optical/NIR SED for the potential optical
counterpart SSS17a first reported by Coulter et al. (GCN 21529). These data
are compiled from the photometry reported in circulars submitted during the
first night of follow-up. We correct these data for extinction due to
reddening along the line of sight to the host galaxy NGC 4993.

We perform a preliminary fit with a blackbody function to this SED finding
an effective temperature of T = 8000 K and an effective radius of R = 6e14
cm.

We test the sensitivity of our fit to the UV flux, refitting with the
Swift/UVOT data excluded. We find T = 10,200 K and R ~ 4e14 cm.

In both cases, the large expansion radius and short time since explosion (t
~ 1 day) suggest an expansion velocity of >0.2c. This is too fast to be
explained by supernova ejecta, but is consistent with the expansion
velocities expected for relativistic BNS/NS-BH merger ejecta.

These values, and the inferred relativistic expansion, are consistent with
the results of Malesani et al. (GCN 21577).
