D. A. Perley and J. S. Bloom report,

On the night of 21 November 2006 (UT), we began spectroscopic 
observations of GRB061121 at 15:35 UT using Keck I (+LRIS).  The optical 
afterglow is visible in the finder camera in early twilight and is 
detected in 120-second spectroscopic exposures down to the atmospheric 
cutoff.  Strong absorption features are observed.  Observations are 
continuing.
