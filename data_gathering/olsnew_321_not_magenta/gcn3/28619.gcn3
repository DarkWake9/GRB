C. Malacaria (NASA-MSFC/USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-201014A
(GCN 28616), the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 221.22 ((1.00, -0.75) deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 14.44 ((+0.67 -0.46) deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 17.2 minutes prior 
until 17.1 minutes after event time. 
Therefore, the GBM observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
