V. Rumyantsev (CrAO) and A. Pozanenko (IKI)  report on behalf of larger GRB 
follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 090814A (Ukwatta et al. GCN 9793; Updike et 
al., GCN 9794) with   Shajn telescope of  CrAO on Aug. 14 between  (UT) 
19:02:44 - 19:56:58 under modarate seeing of about 1.9 arcsec. We  detect 
afterglow   in a stacked image. The coordinates of the afterglow are (J2000) 
15 58 26.36 +25 37 52.32 in a full agreement with reported earlier (A. 
Updike et al., GCN 9794).  The photometry against nearby USNO-B1.0 star 15 
58 23.11  +25 39 07.2  16.64 R is following:

T0+     Filter, Exposure, mag.,     err.
(d)                (s)

   R     51x60     22.10 +/- 0.08

We confirm the shallow decay of the afterglow (D. Xu et al., GCN 9809) with 
power law index ~0.3.
