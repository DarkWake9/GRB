M. Jelinek, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), P. Kubanek (IAA-CSIC 
and IPL-UV) and A. de Ugarte Postigo (OAB), on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

"The TELMA 0.6m robotic telescope at the BOOTES-2 astronomical station 
in South Spain has responded to GRB 100614A 18s after the GCN notice 
(and about 6.9 min after the onset of the GRB).  The co-add of 36 images 
(3-s each, unfiltered) obtained through cirrusses provides a R = 18 
limiting magnitude at the position of the X-ray atterglow (Stratta et 
al. GCNC 10837)."
