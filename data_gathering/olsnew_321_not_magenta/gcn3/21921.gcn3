report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

During the commissioning phase, at 2017-09-06T00:43:06.00 (T0),
Insight-HXMT/HE detected GRB 170906A (trigger ID: HEB170906029)
in a routine search of the data,which is also detected by CALET
(Penacchioni et al., GCN 21884), Fermi/GBM (Hamburg et al., GCN 21839)
and Swift/BAT (Siegel et al., GCN 21821).

The Insight-HXMT light curve mainly consists of multi-pulses
with a duration (T90) of 64.6 s measured from T0+2.3 s. 
The 1-second peak rate, measured from T0+35.3 s, is 1870.6 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 26305.3 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5 s to T0+70 s is
adequately fit by a Power Law model with spectral index = -2.70 +/- 0.06.
The energy fluence is (5.94 +/- 0.20)E-04 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 5000 keV
in this time interval.


The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
