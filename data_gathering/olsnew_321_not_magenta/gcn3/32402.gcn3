report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:58:06.27 UT on 14 July 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220714B (trigger 679499891 / 220714582)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (S. Laha et al. 2022, GCN 32393)
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 32392) is consistent
with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 121 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.07 s to T0+26.6 s is
well by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.63 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 139 +/- 24 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.0 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+11.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.5 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
