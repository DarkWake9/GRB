E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Further data have been obtained for this event (GCN 1547).  Ulysses and
Konus observed this burst at 16810 s.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of ~6 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of ~4.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a
peak flux over 0.25 s of ~1 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated
it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=170.753, +39.335, with
radius 48.044 +/- 0.015 degrees (3 sigma)  A preliminary analysis of
the Konus data indicates that it arrived from an ecliptic latitude
between -5 and +5 degrees.  This limits the annulus to the two sections
between RA, Decl.=123.4, +14.8 and 114.5, +26.6, and between
RA, Decl.= 183.9, -7.1 and 197.4, -2.0.

As Mars Odyssey did not observe this event, it will not be possible
to derive a small error box for it.
