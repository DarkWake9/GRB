K. Alexander (Harvard), T. Laskar (NRAO / UC Berkeley), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 150910A (Pagani et al; GCN 18264) at multiple frequencies
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning 2015 September
11.10 UT (0.72 days after the burst). At a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz, we
detect a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~ 0.1 mJy at

RA = 00:22:40.120 +/- 0.021
Dec = +33:28:21.750 +/- 0.036

consistent with the UVOT optical position (McCauley et al; GCN 18270) and
the enhanced Swift/XRT position (Evans et al.; GCN 18271). Follow-up
observations are planned.
