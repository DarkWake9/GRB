Report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,
(=H2656, Vanderspek et al. GCN 1997), identified
by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986),
in the Johnson B-Band with the SARA 0.9m telescope at 
KPNO. We obtained 28, 300s exposures.  Observations
began at 02:42:47UT, and ended at 05:13:30UT, on April
4th.  The obsevations were carried out under good 
seeing conditions.  Aperture photometry is being 
carried out, and further observations are planned. 

We thank SARA observer Dr. Scott Shaw for making part 
of his observing time available to us.
