At 23:47:57 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080605 (trigger=313299).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 262.127, +4.002 which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 28m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = +04d 00' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple overlapping
peaks lasting at least to T+8 sec (at which the TDRSS lightcurve is
truncated).  The peak count rate was ~17000 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:49:28.2 UT, 90.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 262.1249, +4.0153 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 28m 29.9s
   Dec(J2000) = +04d 00' 55.0"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 48 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The UVOT detects a new source within the XRT error circle.  We are unable to 
obtain a position or magnitude at this time.  The source is very close to a 
known source in the DSS.  Further information will be provided when it is available. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (sbarufatti AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
