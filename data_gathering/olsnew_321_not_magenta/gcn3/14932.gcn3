H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC),
F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 21:08:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on trigger=559108. 
Swift slewed immediately to the location.  However, we believe that this was
an erroneous trigger on a bright source for which the BAT flight software
used the incorrect attitude.  Therefore, we believe that trigger 559108 is
neither a GRB nor the catalog source IGR_J11215-5952, nor any other
astrophysical event.
