E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), report on behalf 
of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded 
to GRB 080703A (Swift trigger 315819). The first image was at 19:00:45.1 
UT, 31.5 s after the burst (11.1 s after the GCN notice time). The 
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 14.7 
magnitude, steady source with coordinates:

      06:47:12.7      -63:13:08.6    (J2000), with positional 
uncertainty of 1" or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker 
database.

A jpeg image is available at

marked 18 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
