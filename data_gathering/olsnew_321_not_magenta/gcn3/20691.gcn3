(INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Cholden-Brown (PSU), S. J.
LaPorte (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S.L. Gibson (U. Leicester) and P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 170214A. The observations now extend from
T0+38.6 ks to T0+274.4 ks. 

Of the sources previously reported, "Source 1" is above the RASS limit
and fading with 3-sigma significance, and is therefore likely the GRB
afterglow. Using 4445 s of PC mode data and 4 UVOT images, we find an
enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT
field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 256.34147, -1.88746
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 17h 05m 21.95s
Dec(J2000): -01d 53' 14.9"

with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 49 arcsec from the Fermi/LAT position.  The source is
fading with alpha >0.7.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020740/index_1.php.
The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
