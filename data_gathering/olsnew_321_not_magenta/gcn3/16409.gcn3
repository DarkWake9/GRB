D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports:

I imaged the field of GRB 140614B (Page et al., GCN 16394) using MOSFIRE 
on the Keck I 10m telescope in the Ks-band filter.  A sequence of 12 
36-second images was obtained at a midtime of 13:18 UT on 2014-06-15 
(1.27 days after the Swift trigger).

No sources are detected within the XRT error circle (Evans et al, GCN 
16395) to a limiting mag of approximately Ks > 21.9 mag (3-sigma, 
calibrating relative to 2MASS.)

A faint source (Ks = 21.5 +/- 0.2 mag) is detected outside the XRT error 
circle, at a position of RA = 21:30:31.364, dec = +14:55:48.79 (J2000).
