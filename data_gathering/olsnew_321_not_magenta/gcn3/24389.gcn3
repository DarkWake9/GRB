report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the GW trigger time(T0=2019-05-03 
18:54:04 UTC). However, at T0 only about 0.01% of the LIGO localization
region was covered by the Insight-HXMT without occultation by the Earth. Thus we 
cannot set upper limit on the impulsive emission for this GW event.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
