D. Xu (DARK, NAOC), H.-B. Niu, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the field of MAXI-detected GRB 141229A (Fujita et al., GCN
17246), using the 1m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang,
China, which has a field of view of 1.3x1.3 deg^2. Two epochs of 300s
R-band images were obtained at 15:26:23 UT and 18:36:14 UT on
2014-12-29, respectively. No optical source was detected at the XRT
position reported in Bernardini et al. (GCN 17251), down to a limiting
magnitude of R=20.5.
