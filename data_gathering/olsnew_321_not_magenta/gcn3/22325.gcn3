A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. Deich (PSU),
J.D. Gropp (PSU), J. A. Kennea (PSU) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on
behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 02:47:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180113A (trigger=804999).  Due to an observing constraint,
Swift could not slew to this burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 19.215, +68.682 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 16m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 40' 55"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~9000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not be able to observe
this location until at least T0+36 hours.  There will be no 
XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
