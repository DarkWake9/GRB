At 10:58:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140606A (trigger=600951).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 201.808, +37.579 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 27m 14s
   Dec(J2000) = +37d 34' 44"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double peak
structure with a duration of about 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

XRT is currently not collecting science data. There will be no XRT data
on this burst until the anomaly is resolved. Details are given in GCN
Circ. 16349. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 67 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.01. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
