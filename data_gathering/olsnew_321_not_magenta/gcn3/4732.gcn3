(INAF Bologna) report:
 
During the night of February 6 -7, 2006 we observed the OT of
GRB 060206 (Morris et al. GCN 4682; Fynbo et al. GCN 4683) with
the 152 cm Loiano telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera system.
The weather conditions were not photometric and the seeing was
2.5 arcsec.
We obtained 3 images x 20 minutes in Rc filter, 2 x 30 minutes in V
and 2 x 20 minutes in I. The 2 V frames have been co-added.
We determined the following magnitudes derived from USNO-B1.0 (R1)
catalogue for the Rc and I bands and NOMAD catalogue for V band:
 
mean time (UT).......filter................ mag
 
6.960 ................ Rc ............ 19.78+/-0.15
6.976 ................ Rc ............ 19.70+/-0.11
6.990 ................ Rc ............ 19.79+/-0.12
7.025 ................ V ............. 20.06+/-0.17
7.054 ................ I ............. 19.16+/-0.11
7.069 ................ I ............. 19.19+/-0.10


We thank very much N. Masetti, who has obtained the images.
Our RVI images, in which the comparison stars are marked, have been
