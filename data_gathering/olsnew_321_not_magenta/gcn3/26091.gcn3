I observed the field of GRB 191029A (Evans et al., GCN #26088) with remote
telescope T30 (0.50-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD) of iTelescope.Net in Siding
Spring Observatory, Australia. Two images with a luminance filter were
obtained on 2019-10-29 13:16:48 UT (7288 seconds after trigger) with 60
seconds exposure time and on 13:18:46 UT (7406 seconds after trigger) with
120 seconds exposure time (the average time of each exposure). I did not
detect any optical transients (magnitude limit of about 19.2 G from Gaia
DR2 catalogue).
