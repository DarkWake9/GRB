Princeton University report: ``Observations made on Dec 17 UT 
using the ARC 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory show 
that the optical transient reported by Halpern et al. in IAUC 6788 
has continued to fade.  We measure on Dec 17.51 UT a magnitude 
R=24.4+-0.5 for the OT, from six 10 min exposures taken by Corson, 
Gilmore and Wyse.  Calibration of photometry has been done using 
Landolt standard star 104239."
