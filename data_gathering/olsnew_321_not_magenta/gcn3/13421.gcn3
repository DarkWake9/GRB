M. Bremer, J. M. Winters, S. König (IRAM Grenoble), A. de Ugarte Postigo 
and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada) on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of the intense GRB 120624B by different 
spacecraft (GCNC 13379, 13381,13382), we have conducted follow-up 
observations at 3 mm with the PdBI on June 28 and July 2. Consistent 
with the position of the proposed X-ray afterglow (GCNC 13394, 13400) we 
detect a 1 mJy source (6 sigma). Observations are ongoing".
