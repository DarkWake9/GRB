report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131218A detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 6409) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations are R filtered, started 0.87 day after
the GRB trigger. The limiting magnitude of the co added
image is Rlim = 20.5.

In the error box provided by INTEGRAL notice we detect
only one faint candidate not present on the DSS atlas:

RA(J2000.0) = 07h 35m 10.50s
DEC(J2000.0) = -64d 43' 19.4"

OT was R~20.0 0.87 day after GRB.

We have no more images so we cannnot conclude if it
is a fading source or not. Additional images are
programmed to be recorded in the next nights.
