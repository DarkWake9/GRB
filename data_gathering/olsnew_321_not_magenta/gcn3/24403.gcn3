At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190503bf,
T0=2019-05-03 18:54:04.294 UTC (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24377), the high-voltage of the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) detectors were off
(from T0-23 min to T0+8 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger mode
at the trigger time of S190503bf. Using the CAL data, we have searched for
gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band within the time interval
T0 +/- 60 sec and found no candidates.
The 90% upper limit of CAL is 4.2x10^-5 erg/cm2/s (10-100 GeV) when
the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 10%.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA=169.0 deg, Dec=-45.5 deg at T0.
