D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), J.A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti
(INAF-OAB/PSU), and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the IPN-detected
burst GRB 180409A in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The
total exposure time is 3.5 ks, distributed over 4 tiles; the maximum
exposure at a single sky location was 2.4 ks. The data were collected
between T0+53.5 ks and T0+71.6 ks, and are entirely in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected, it is below the RASS
limit and shows no definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the
present time we cannot confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this
source are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  175.8434  =  11:43:22.42
  Dec (J2000.0): +36.2335  =  +36:14:00.6
  Error: 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: 0.0258 +/- 0.0068 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 268 arcsec from IPN position.
  Flux: (8.3 +/- 2.2)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the tiled XRT
observations, including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are
available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00069.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
