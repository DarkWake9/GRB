report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 151022A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 18436)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 14:13 UT on 22th October, 0.12h after
the BAT trigger, to 14:56 UT. The total exposure of 17.0 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 18438) down to limiting
magnitude of Ks=14.8 (Vega, S/N=10). The photometric calibration was
made against 2MASS field stars.
