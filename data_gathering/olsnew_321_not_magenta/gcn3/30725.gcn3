Gropp (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester),
A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T. Sbarrato
(INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 210826A (Ohno et al. GCN Circ. 30721), for
a total exposure time of 4.9 ks. The data were collected between
T0+36.5 ks and T0+49.7 ks, and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC)
mode.

Eight uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. We notice that one of the sources (Source 8) is consistent
with a catalogued galaxy at redshift z = 0.05. Details of these sources
are given below:
