Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 211023B (trigger #1080859)
(Dichiara, et al., GCN Circ. 30960).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 170.314, 39.133 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  11h 21m 15.3s 
  Dec(J2000) = +39d 07' 58.7" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.

The mask-weighted light curves shows a single peak from approximately T+0
to T+1.5 seconds.   T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.30 +- 0.26 sec (estimated error including 
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.01 to T+1.45 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.97 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
