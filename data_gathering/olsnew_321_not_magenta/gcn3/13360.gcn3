Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120612A (trigger #524128)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 13357).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 126.723, -17.598 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 26m 53.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 35' 52.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad peak starting at ~T+15 sec,
peaking at roughtly T+35 sec, and ending around T+150 sec with a long
low-level tail out to about T+380 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 90 +- 14 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+16.9 to T+125.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.36 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+30.20 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
