Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060814 (trigger #224552)
(Moretti, et al., GCN Circ. 5447).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA,Dec = 221.336, 20.593 deg {14h 45m 20.6s, 20d 35' 36.3"} (J2000)
+- 0.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 64%.
 
There are four main peaks.  The first starts at ~T-10 sec and blends into
the second peak which peaks at T+16 and ends around T+40 sec. The second peak
is the brightest.  The third peak starts roughly T+50, peaks at ~T+70 and
ends at ~T+110 sec.  It is half as bright as the second peak.  The fourth and
much smaller peak is about 40 sec wide and peaks at T+130 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 146 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.4 to T+224 is best fit by a simple power-law
model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.56 +- 0.03.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.50 +- 0.02 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+15.40 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 7.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
