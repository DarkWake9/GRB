Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220611A (trigger #1110090)
(Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 32191).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 66.505, -37.265 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 26m 01.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 15' 54.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 70%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~T0
and ends at ~T+60 s. There might be a possible precursor emission
(~ 5 sigma in the 15-350 keV image) from ~T-90 s to ~T-85 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 57.00 +- 12.37 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.52 to T+61.52 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.87 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
6.7 +- 1.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. All the quoted errors are at
the 90% confidence level.
