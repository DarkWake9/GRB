Edo Berger and Andy McWilliam (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"On 2005, June 3.412 UT (3.4 hrs after the burst) we imaged the BAT error
circle of GRB 050603 (GCN 3509) with the du Pont 100-inch telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory in the R-band.  Within the 4' radius error circle we
find a single bright source (R~16.5 mag) which is not present in the DSS 
at coordinates (J2000):
        RA = 02:39:57
        DEC=-25:10:54
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  At the present we
do have information about variability."
