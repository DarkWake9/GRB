S. B. Cenko (Caltech), W. Reach, and D. Faied (JPL / IPAC) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060123 (Palmer et al., GCN 4584) with the
Large Format Camera mounted on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope.
Observations consisted of 300 s frames in r' and i' beginning at
approximately 8:35 January 25 UT (~ 34.2 hours after the burst).  In
single r' and i' exposures, we find no new sources in the XRT error circle
to a limiting magnitude of r',i' > 22.0.  This limiting magnitude was
calculated with reference to the SDSS calibration stars provided by Cool
et al. (GCN 4585).
