At 03:34:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060218 (trigger=191157).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 50.404, +16.866 deg
{03h 21m 37s, +16d 51' 58"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).  The TDRSS
lightcurve shows nothing, which is consistent and common for an image trigger.

The XRT began taking data at 03:37:04 UT, 153 seconds after the BAT trigger.
The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in the image and
no prompt position is available.  We are waiting for down-linked data
to detect and determine a position for the source.

The UVOT began taking data 152 seconds after the BAT trigger.
There is an indication of an afterglow candidate at RA,Dec
03h 21m 39.8s,+16d 52' 06" +/- 1 arcsec with an estimated B magnitude of 19.4.
