and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190630ag,
T0 = 2019-06-30 18:52:05.180 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24922), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-15 min to 
T0+0.5 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy
trigger mode at the trigger time of S190630ag. Using the CAL data,
we have searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV
band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and
found no candidates.
The 90% upper limit of CAL is 1.2x10^-5 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) when
the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 25%.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA= 84.0 deg, DEC= 31.5 deg at T0.
