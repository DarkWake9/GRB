(UNAM), and Tanner Wolfram (ASU) report:

We observed the region of maximum probability of the LIGO/Virgo
candidate S190408an with the DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir
(http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx).

We observed a region of approximately 11 degrees in declination by 7
degrees in RA centered on 23:26:00 +54:46:00 2000 from 2019-04-09 11:03
UTC to 12:08 UTC (16.8 to 17.8 hours after trigger) obtaining a total of
42 minutes exposure in the w filter at high airmass.

Analysis is ongoing and interesting transient source will be reported
later.
