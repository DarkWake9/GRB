Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151031A (trigger #662330)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 18538).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 83.189, -39.125 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  05h 32m 45.3s
    Dec(J2000) = -39d 07' 28.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-shaped peak, peaking at T+2 sec
and returning to background by T+7 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.00 +- 2.24 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.30 to T+6.30 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.41 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-7erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
