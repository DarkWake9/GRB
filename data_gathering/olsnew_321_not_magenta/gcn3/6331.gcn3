We observed the field of the GRB 070420 (Stamatikos et al. GCN 6330)  
with the robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). A   
set of observations was performed automatically in the optical and  
near infrared filters (V, R, I and J, H, K, z) starting on 2007 April  
20 at 06:19:32 UT, 42s after the Swift trigger and 79s after the GRB  
time.

Although the observations were performed under thin clouds and at  
very high airmass (~ 7.5) we clearly detect the NIR and optical  
afterglow at the coordinates reported by UVOT (GCN 6330).

Preliminary analysis gives an approximate magnitude about 5 minutes  
after the burst time was H  = 13.1 +/- 0.2.

Observations were then soon interrupted due to excessive airmass.
