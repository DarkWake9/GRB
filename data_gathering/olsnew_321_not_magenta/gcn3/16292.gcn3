Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140516A (trigger #599188)
(Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 16285).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 252.972, 39.958 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 51m 53.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +39d 57' 28.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T+0.0,
peaking at ~T+0.05, and ending at ~T+0.3 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 0.19 +- 0.09 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.01 to T+0.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.87 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.6 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.38 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
