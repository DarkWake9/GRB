The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of
GRB050306 (GCN 3071) on March 7th, 2005 at 14:58:53 UT. Before this time
GRB 050306 was within the Swift Moon avoidance angle.  Over an 8,630s
exposure combined from four snapshots between 35 and 41 hours after the
trigger, we detect no new or variable source down to a V magnitude of 21.2
(5-sigma upper limit)  in the BAT error circle. This includes the position
of the X-ray candidate reported in GCN 3072.
