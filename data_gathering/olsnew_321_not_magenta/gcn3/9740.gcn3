Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of trigger #358760 (Subrufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 9739).
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 189.693, -15.363 deg,
with an uncertainty of 3.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
This is 2.7 arcmin from the flight position.  The partial coding was 100%.
This is only a 5.5 sigma detection in the image domain.  The mask-weighted
lightcurve shows a very marginal detection in the 25-100 keV band in a single
64 msec time bin and nothing in the other two energy bands.  There is also
a weak cosmic ray shower during this 64-msec bin.  Given this very maginal
evidence, we do not think this trigger is due to a GRB.  It is very
probably a noise fluctution coupled with a weak CR Shower. However, we can not
rule out a GRB origin.
