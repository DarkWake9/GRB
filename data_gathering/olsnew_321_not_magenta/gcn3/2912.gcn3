E. Rykoff, T. McKay, H. Swan (U. Michigan) report on behalf of the ROTSE 
collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. sit at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to Swift GRB041224 (GCN#2908).  A manual response was 
initiated at 23:20:41 UT, 3 hours after the burst.  We took 10 5-s 
exposures followed by 250 20-s exposures.  All the images were taken 
with >95% moon illumination.  The unfiltered images were calibrated 
relative to USNO A2.0.  Individual images have limiting magnitudes 
around 17.2.  Comparison to DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources 
within the 3-sigma error circle to a limiting magnitude of 18.5 for 
stacks of 10 images taken during the first hour of observation.
