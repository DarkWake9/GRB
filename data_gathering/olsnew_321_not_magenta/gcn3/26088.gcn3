P. A. Evans (U Leicester), J.D. Gropp (PSU), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
N. J. Klingler (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
A. Tohuvavohu (Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 11:15:20 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191029A (trigger=932058).  Swift did not slew immediately 
because of an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 352.140, -40.464 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 23h 28m 34s
   Dec(J2000) = -40d 27' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1080 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.5
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
