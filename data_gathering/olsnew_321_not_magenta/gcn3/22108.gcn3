MASTER OT J034412.48-263556.5 (Lipunov et al., ATEL #10929 ; Lipunov et 
al. GCN #22102) was observed at  Lijiang 2.4m telescope for this 
transient, which shows blue and featureless continuum  like that 
of GRB170817A (Kilonova) but much brighter.
   We used YFOSC+G3 to  get the spectrum.

The second Spectrum was taken at 2-m aperture optical-infrared telescope, 
the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) with HFOSC (Hanle Faint Object 
Spectrograph Camera  https://www.iiap.res.in//iao/hfosc.html ) at Indian 
Astronomical Observatory https://www.iiap.res.in//iao/iao.html
