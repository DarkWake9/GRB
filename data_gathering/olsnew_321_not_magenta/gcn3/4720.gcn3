report:

    The error circle of GRB 060209 (Swift-BAT Trigger 180931,
Osborne et al., GCN 4717) was  observed with Russian-Turkish
1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey) in R, starting on Feb. 09, 19:17 UT, i.e. ~8min after the burst.

    A series of frames (2*60s, 9*100s exposures) were taken under bad 
weather conditions. We did not detect new source. Using USNO-B1 stars we 
estimate limiting magnitude of combined image as: R~20.3
