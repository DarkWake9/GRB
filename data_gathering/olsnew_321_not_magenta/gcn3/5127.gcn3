SUBJECT: GRB 060512: 1.54m Kuiper Observations
DATE:    06/05/13 08:56:52 GMT
FROM:    Peter A. Milne at Super-LOTIS  <pmilne@as.arizona.edu>

P.A.Milne (Steward Obs) on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS GRB team reports:
 
We observed the field of GRB 060512
starting at UT=05:48 (~6.6 hrs after the burst),
with the 1.54m Kuiper telescope at Mt. Bigelow, AZ.
We obtained 5 x 300-sec images in the R-band filter.
The mean epoch of observations was 05:59 13 May 2006.
Observing conditions were affected by thin clouds
in addition to the bright moon.
 
We detect the candidate optical counterpart reported
by Cummings et al. (GCN 5117), Mundell and Steele (GCN 5118),
Malesani et al. (GCN 5122) , Cenko (GCN 5125), and
Hearty et al. (GCN 5126). Based upon comparison with
USNO-B stars, we estimate the magnitude to be
R=20.14 +/- 0.16.
