I.A. Smith (Rice U.), D.A. Perley (LJMU), and N.R. Tanvir 
(U. of Leicester) report:

We observed GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 23688)
using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James 
Clerk Maxwell Telescope in very good weather conditions on 
UT 2019-01-15, 2019-01-16, and 2019-01-18.  The source was not 
detected in the separate nights, or in the combination of all
the data.  The RMS background noise in the combined image was
0.95 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 5.4 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Mark Rawlings, Kevin Silva, Sheona Urquart, and the 
JCMT staff for the prompt support of these observations that 
were taken under project M18BP040.
