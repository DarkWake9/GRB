M.L. Conciatore, M. Capalbi, M. Perri, L. Vetere (ASDC), D.N. Burrows
(PSU) and M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT
team:


We have analyzed the first 5 orbits of XRT data from GRB 060719
(Stamatikos et al., GCN 5339). A 8.4 ks Photon Counting mode image
provides a refined XRT position:

RA(J2000) = 01h 13m 43.57s,
Dec(J2000) = -48d 22m 55.0s

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (90% containment). This position is 3.1
arcsec away from the preliminary XRT position reported in GCN 5339.

The X-ray light curve displays two flares during the first orbit at
about 130 seconds and 190 seconds after the BAT trigger. The afterglow
decay from T+300s to T+24ks can be fit with a broken power-law with an
initial decay slope of -0.2+/-0.1, a break at 6.9+/-1.7 ks, and a
post-break slope of -1.3+/-0.3.

A power-law fit to the 0.3-10 keV spectrum from T+86s to T+128s gives a
photon index of 3.0+/-0.4 and a column density of
(2.4+/-0.9)e21 cm**-2. We note the Galactic hydrogen column density
in the direction of the burst is 1.9e20cm**-2.

If the burst continues decaying at the current rate we estimate a
0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux of ~4e-13 ergs cm**-2 s**-1 at T+24hr.
