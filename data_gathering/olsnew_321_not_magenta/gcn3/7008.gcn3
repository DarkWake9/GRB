J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P.R. Wozniak, R. White, H. Davis
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

Our Raptor telescopes responded to Swift trigger 295301
(Pagani et al., GCN 6986) at 04:10:14.0 UT, 80.3 seconds
after the trigger and 4.2 seconds after receiving the
GCN packet.  We detect faint optical emission from the
counterpart reported by the ROTSE team (Rykoff et al., GCN
6987 and Covino et al., GCN 6988).  We observe the first
optical peak reported by Rykoff et al. (GCN 6992) at T+~600s.
The counterpart then fades until T+~1200s.  The optical
lightcurve then rebrightens to a peak near T+~1400s at about
the level of the previous peak.  This "twin peaks" behavior
seems to be consistent with the IR behavior reported by
Bloom et al. (GCN 7002).
