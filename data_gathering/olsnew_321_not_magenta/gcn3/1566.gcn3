report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

  We are observing the WXM error box of GRB 021004 (GCN 1565) from
Oct. 4 12:41 UT with 0.30-m telescope (+unfiltered CCD) at Kyoto
University.  First 30sec * 52 exposure were obtained until 13:16 UT.
An inspection of a integrated image reveal the optical afterglow
candidate (Fox et al., GCN 1564) at R mag about 16.3, which confirms 
further rapid decline of this object.  The observation and analysis
are in progress.
