on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 061019 (Guidorzi et al. GCN 5728, 5729)   
with the  robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). A  
first set  of observations was performed automatically in the optical  
and near infrared (V,R,I and z', J, H, K bands) starting on October  
19 5:23 UT.

A preliminary analysis reveals an uncatalogued source of K ~ 14.5 at  
RA,DEC = (06:06:30.85, +29:34:13.3).

At present we cannot say whether this source is fading or not.  
Further observations are in progress.

This message may be cited.
