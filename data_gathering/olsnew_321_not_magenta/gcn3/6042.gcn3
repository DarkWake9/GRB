A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 070125 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at January 26 17.04 UT to 22.49 UT,
i.e. 1.40 - 1.63 days after the burst (GCN 6024).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 6034). The three-sigma rms noise in het map around that position is
261 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at
the position of the optical counterpart is 44 +/- 87 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
