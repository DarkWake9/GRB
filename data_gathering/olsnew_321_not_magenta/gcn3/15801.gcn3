G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) and F. Nocentini (Frosinone, Italy) report:

On Feb. 6.9216 2014 UT, we imaged the field around GRB 140206A (Lien et. al GCN
15784 , Gotz et. al GCN 15784) remotely using the the 0.43m-f/6.8 robotic unit 
part of the Virtual Telescope robotic facility in Italy.

The source is visible on 300 seconds unfiltered CCD images at the following 
coordinates (J2000.0):

R.A. = 09 41 20.23
Decl. +66 45 38.5

We also performed photometry, assuming R-mags from UCAC-4 for the stars in the
field, getting an estimate for the magnitude of 18.9CR).

Observations are ongoing.
