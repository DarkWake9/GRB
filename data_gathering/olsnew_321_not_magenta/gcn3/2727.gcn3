TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2727
SUBJECT: XRF040916, optical observations
DATE:    04/09/19 01:48:04 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have an Ic mosaic of the field for XRF040916
(Yamazaki et al. GCN 2712)  taken with the NOFS 1.0m telescope
about an hour earlier than the data reported by
Kosugi et al. (GCN 2726).  Their proposed candidate appears
on that mosaic at position
23:00:55.13 -05:38:43.2 J2000
(errors 0.2arcsec) and with magnitude
Ic = 20.51 +/- 0.23
based on the calibration photometry of Henden (GCN 2719).
This would imply a very red object or rapid fading.
