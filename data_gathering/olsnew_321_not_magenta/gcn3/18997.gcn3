T. Kruehler, C. Delvaux , J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf
of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 160206A (Furuya et al., GCN #18993)
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120,
405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG telescope at ESO La Silla Observatory
(Chile).

Observations centered on XRT source #2 (Page et al. 2016, GCN #18996)
started at 00:40 UT on 2016-02-07, 22.3 hrs after the GRB trigger. They
were performed at an average seeing of 1.5" and at an average airmass of
1.4.

We detect no source brighter than the Digitized Sky Survey limiting
magnitudes in the 5.8" Swift-XRT error circle. There is one fainter source
(r'~22.6 AB mag) at RA(2000.0) = 08:50:14.1, Decl.(2000.0) = -36:00:52,
but no statement about variability  can be made at this stage.
