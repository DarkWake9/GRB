Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180514A (trigger #832368)
(LaPorte et al., GCN Circ. 22723).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 197.382, 36.970 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  13h 09m 31.7s
  Dec(J2000) = +36d 58' 13.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 91%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~T-8 s,
peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+55 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 46.9 +- 14.5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.33 to T+54.71 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
