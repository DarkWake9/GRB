report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G288732 (GCN #21221), we performed
an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on
different
timescales. On LIGO trigger time (T0=2017-06-08 02:01:16.492 UTC) the GRID
exposure covered approximately 40% of the LIGO localization region observed
with off-axis angles between 40 and 70 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0.
Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible G288732 localization region are reported below:

from 1.6e-06 to 3.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s
from 1.6e-07 to 6.8e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 20s
from 4.0e-08 to 3.0e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

These ULs apply to a large fraction of the GRID-exposed LIGO localization
region.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
