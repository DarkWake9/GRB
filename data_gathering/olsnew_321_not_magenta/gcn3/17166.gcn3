S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC/UCL-MSSL), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) report 
on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of GRB 141212B of 127 seconds with the White filter
starting 402 seconds after the BAT trigger (trigger=621234). No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers the preliminary XRT error circle 
(Kennea et al. GCN Circ. 17165). The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag.
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.03.
