D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, S. Fotopoulou(ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:
a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 09:58:58 UT of February 23, 2016.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=   94.9937 deg
DEC.=   +33.4075 deg

with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 1.2 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 1.6e-6 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
