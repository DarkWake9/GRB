We observed the central 10x10 arcmin region of the error circle of the
Swift-BAT trigger(Holland et al. GCN 4570) in Bessell R filter with  the
2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope, Hanle, India, starting from 2006 January
24.715 UT.

The OT of GRB 060124 detected by Kann (GCN 4577) and confirmed by Kann
et al (GCN 4579) was also detected in our individual frames of 600 s each.
Priliminary R band brightness was about 17 mag with respect to the nearby
USNO A2 stars. Further analysis is in progress.
