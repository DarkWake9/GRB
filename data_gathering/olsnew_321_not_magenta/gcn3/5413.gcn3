P. Schady  (UCL-MSSL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of the GRB060805B on Aug. 7th at 
01:34:52 UT. No optical afterglow candidate has been found in the coadded 
images of any of the UV/optical lenticular filters within the IPN error 
box reported by Hurley et al. (GCN 5407).

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for the coadded images for the
6 filters are listed below:

Filter       Tstart (UT)      Exposure(s)     3sig upper limits
V            02:02:23         1397             20.56
B            01:45:13         1397             21.61
U            01:41:44         1397             21.26
UVW1         01:34:52         2802             20.77
UVM2         02:05:50         3619             21.27
UVW2         01:48:42         2402             21.27


These upper limits have not been corrected for the estimated Galactic reddening 
of E(B-V) = 0.037 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
