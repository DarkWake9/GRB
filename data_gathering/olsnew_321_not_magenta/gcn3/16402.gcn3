Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140614A (trigger #601646)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 16391).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 231.171, -79.110 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 24m 41.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -79d 06' 36.9" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.
 
The mask-weighted light curvea shows a broad peak starting at ~T-80 sec,
peaking at ~T+55 sec, and returning to baseline at ~T+200 sec (and 
possibly out to  around T+600 sec).  The formal T90 (15-350 keV) is 720 +- 160 sec,
but with the long weak possible tail of this event it is hard to determine
the true end of the event (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.51 to T+957 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.50 +- 0.46.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.4 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
