Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120729A (trigger #529095)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 13530).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 13.078, 49.936 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  00h 52m 18.8s
    Dec(J2000) = +49d 56' 08.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak with a rise of ~20 secs
and a fall of ~100 seconds.  There are no significant subsidiary peaks.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 71.5 +- 17.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.08 to T+101.94 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.62 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.03 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
