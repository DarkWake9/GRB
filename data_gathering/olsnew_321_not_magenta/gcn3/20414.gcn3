P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:02:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRS 1716-249/GRO J1719-24/V2293 Oph (trigger=731535). Swift 
did not slew because of Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 259.889, -25.015 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 19m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = -25d 00' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve does not show anything
significant, as it typical for image triggers. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 2017 January 27. So there will be no XRT or UVOT 
observations until then.
