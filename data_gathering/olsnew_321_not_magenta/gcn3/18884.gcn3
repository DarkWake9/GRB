D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI),
R. Carrera (IAC-ULL), C.E. Martinez-Vazquez (IAC-ULL), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland),
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 160117B (Sonbas et al., GCN 
18875; Yurkov et al., GCN 18877; Kruehler et al., GCN 18878) with the 
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera.

In a 300-s exposure taken starting on Jan 18.028 UT (10.7 hr after the 
GRB), we measure for the afterglow a magnitude of R = 20.36 +- 0.11 
(Vega), calibrated against several nearby USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitudes), 
with the uncertainty mostly due to the scatter in the USNO values.
