WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 190926A (Melandri et al.,
GCN 25848) starting at ~59 minutes after the burst. Observations
were performed in the clear (roughly R) filters, a total of 102
images were obtained and the exposure time was 60 s per image.
We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within the Enhanced
XRT position error circle (Goad et al., GCN 25850), neither in single
image, nor in the co-add images. The typical limiting magnitude
of our single clear image is about 19.0 mag.
