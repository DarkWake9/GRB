TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 120312A: WHT candidate afterglow

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), O. Hartoog (U. Amsterdam), and
T. Schrabback (U. Bonn) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of GRB120312A (Stamatikos et al. GCN13049) using the
WHT/ACAM beginning 05:15 UT on March 13th (approximately 13 hours post-burst).
A 24 minute integration was obtained in the z-band.
 
Within the refined XRT error circle (Mangano et al. GCN13053) we find a source
at position:

RA(2000) = 16 47 09.23
dec(2000)= +23 51 28.9

The source may be slightly extended, although the S/N is too poor to
determine this with confidence.  Its provisional magnitude is
z~23.8 +/- 0.2 calibrated against nearby SDSS DR8 stars.
