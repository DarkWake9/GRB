V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:
 
Analysis of Astrosat CZTI data showed the detection of GRB 171119A, which was also detected by IPN Triangulation (Hurley K. et al., GCN 22146) and Konus-Wind observation (Frederiks D. et al., GCN 22147).
 
The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve of the CZT detector shows a multiple peak of emission at 23:48:33 UT. The measured peak count rate is 611.9 cts/s above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 2704 cts. The local mean background count rate was 263.1 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 10.3 s.
 
It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. The Veto light curve shows a strong peak coincident with the peak in the CZT detector.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
