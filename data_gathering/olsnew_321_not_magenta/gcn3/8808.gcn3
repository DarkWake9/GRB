Using the data set from T-120 to T+302 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090113 (trigger #339852)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 8804).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 32.067, 33.436 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 08m 16.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 26' 08.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks starting at ~T-10 sec
and ending at ~T+30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.1 +- 0.9 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.9 to T+10.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.60 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
