The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 02:31:31 UT on 26 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200626A (trigger 614831496.751792 / 200626105).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 87.3, Dec = 16.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 49m, 16d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53.0 degrees.
