We observed the field of GRB 140102A (Hagen et al., GCN 15653) in R-band
using the 1-m telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical Observatory (LOAO) in Arizona,
US

 

The observation started at 2014-01-03 13:01:40 UT, or about 15.34 hours
after the BAT alert.

We marginally identify the afterglow in a stacked image with a total
exposure time of ~ 45min. The approximate magnitude of the object is R(Vega)
= 21.5 +- 0.3 mag, calibrated against R1-mag of USNO-B1 stars in the
vicinity. 

We thank the LOAO operator, Jae-Hyuk Yoon for performing the observation.
