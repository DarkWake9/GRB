Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160630A (trigger #702252)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 19624).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 198.238, -56.029 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  13h 12m 57.0s
  Dec(J2000) = -56d 01' 44.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 51%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-1 s, peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+35 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 29.50 +- 5.51 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.00 to T+34.89 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.32 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
