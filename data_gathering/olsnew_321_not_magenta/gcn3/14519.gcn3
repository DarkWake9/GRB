Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) reports on behalf of a larger team:

We carried out Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 130427A at 1390 GHz band on 2013 Apr 30.57 UT. In our preliminary
analysis we detect the GRB with a flux density of 500+/-94 uJy at
RA, Decl (J200) of 11 32 32.81, +27 41 56.00 which is consistent with
optical position reported by Elenin et al. (GCN 14450) within error bars.

We thank GMRT staff for making these observations possible. More
observations are planned.
