with three of the 16-inch PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 58 sec after
the burst (44 sec after notification) in Ug'r'i'z' (three simultaneously).

No new source is found to z' > 17.1 mag (3 sigma; 10 sec exposure) at 63
sec after the burst and z' > 19.1 (3 sigma; 4 x 40 sec exposures) at 5.3
min after the burst.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned.
