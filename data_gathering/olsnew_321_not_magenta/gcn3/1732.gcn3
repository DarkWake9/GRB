TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1732
SUBJECT: HETE 2493: Optical observations

P.A. Price and D.W. Fox (Caltech) report:

A finding chart for the optical afterglow candidate reported in GCN #1731
is available from

	http://darkalf.caltech.edu/~pap/hete2493.ps

The star marked "Offset1" is at approximate coordinates:
	8:08:58.387 6:43:25.83 J2000
and the offset to the afterglow candidate is 22.29" E and 12.72" N.

At this stage in analysis, we estimate that the afterglow was R ~ 19 mag
at Dec 11, 11:39 UT, and fading.

No spectroscopy can be done with Keck or Palomar 200-inch.  We encourage
any other observers to obtain spectroscopic observations with available
resources.

Further imaging observations are underway.
