(UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:41:04 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060223B (trigger=192152).  Swift did not slew due to a
moon constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 254.241, -30.807 {16h 56m 58s, -30d 48' 24"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

We anticipate that the narrow-field instruments will be able to
observe the burst at about T+18 hours.
