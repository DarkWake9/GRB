We observed MASTER OT J013646.48-140323.5, originally reported in GCN #21445, on 2017-08-12 at 03:25UT using the SPRAT spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope.

The spectra we obtain are fairly poor quality due to the proximity of the moon. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) we tentatively classify this transient as a SN Ia or Ib at around 7 days before peak, with a redshift consistent with the distance of the nearby galaxy (170Mpc, as reported in GCN #21445).
