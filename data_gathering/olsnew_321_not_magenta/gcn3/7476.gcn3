Martin Jelinek, Alberto J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada),
Virginie Chantry (Université de Liege) and
Jorge Plá (IAC La Laguna), on behalf of a larger collaboration,

report:

"We were imaging the naked eye GRB 080319B detected by Swift
(GCN 7427) using.both the 1.2m Mercator Telescope at Obs. del
Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, and the 0.8m IAC80 at
Obs. del Teide in Tenerife.

Between two epochs of imaging, one started at 22:56 (~16.75hr
after the GRB), the other at 3:27UT (20h after) we measure an
aproximate decay index of ~1.3. Our R-band magnitude measured
on an image starting at 22:56UT (16.75 hr after the burst) was
about R=19.8. The value reported in the previous GCN 7469 has
been incorrect."
