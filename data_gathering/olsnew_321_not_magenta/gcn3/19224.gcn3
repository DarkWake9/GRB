O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:59:21.51 UT on the 25th of March 2016, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 160325A
(trigger 480581965 / 160325291), which was also detected by
Swift (Sonbas et al. 2008, GCN 19222). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time
using the Swift XRT position is about 6 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main emission episodes with a
duration (T90) of about 43 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0+2.3 s to T0+45.3 s is well fit by a Band function
with Epeak = 235 +/- 19 keV, alpha = -0.78 +/- 0.05,
and beta = -2.21 +/- 0.14.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.91 +/- 0.04) E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+9.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
