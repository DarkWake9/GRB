report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 00:36:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191031A (trigger=932435).  Swift did not slew due to an 
observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 233.470, +6.144 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 33m 53s
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 08' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 23:18 UT on 2019 December 22. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. D'Ai (antonino.dai AT inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
