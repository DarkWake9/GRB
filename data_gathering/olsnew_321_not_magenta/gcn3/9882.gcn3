Tosti, V. Testa, S.D. Vergani, F. Vitali report on behalf of the REM team:

The REM 60-cm robotic telescope located at ESO-La Silla reacted promptly after
the Swift alert for GRB09094B. Observations began 108 seconds after the GRB time
(40 s after the trigger) with the R and H bands and continued with all the
available filters (VRIJHK). No transient was singled out in the images, although
a not varying 2MASS star with H=11.95 seems to be coincident with the XRT position.
The field is located very close to the Galactic Center (LII = 2.12 deg, BII =
3.64 deg) and is heavily reddened and crowded, requiring further analyses to
evaluate the chance for this positional coincidence.

Further observations are in progress.
