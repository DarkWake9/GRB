Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, 

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, Konus, and Mars Odyssey
GRB teams, report:

Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), and RHESSI also observed this
burst (GCN 1788).  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered at RA, Decl. (2000) = 50.165, +17.735 degrees, whose radius is
58.484 +/- 0.030 degrees (3 sigma).  The Konus ecliptic latitude
response (-55 to -15 degrees), combined with the four-spacecraft
triangulation, constrains the arrival direction to that portion of the
annulus between RA, Decl. = 82, -32 and 109, +7 degrees.

This localization can be improved, but as the burst was
not observed by Ulysses, a small error box cannot be obtained for it.
