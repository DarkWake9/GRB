on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 17:24:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190110A (trigger=883012).  Swift did not slew due to an observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 276.882, -53.676, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 27m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = -53d 40' 34"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several peaks
with a total duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 16:10 UT on 2019 February 01. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (bxs60 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
