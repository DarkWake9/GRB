Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:



"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward GRB
070306 (GCN 6169) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2007 March 8th at 5.22 
UT. The GRB is undetected and the 2-sigma upper limit on the peak radio 
flux at the SWIFT-XRT position (GCN 6172) is 60 uJy (rms 30 uJy).
