T. Kawabata (BAO), Y. Urata (Titech / RIKEN) report:

We have obtained the R band images of the entire HETE-2 SXC error circle
of GRB020819 (Vanderspek et al., GCN #1508) with the Bisei Astronomical
Observatory (BAO) 1.01-m telescope starting at Aug. 19 18:34 UT (3.6 hrs
after the burst). The limiting magnitude of a combined image of 35
frames (FOV 7.8'x5.2', each exposure time 90 seconds) is R~20.6 (3 sigma,
compared with USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes). We could not find a new object
in the error circle by the comparison with DSS II red image.
