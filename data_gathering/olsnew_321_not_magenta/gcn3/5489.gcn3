report:


We imaged in 3D the error circle of GRB 060605 using the Integral Field 
Unit PMAS/PPak (Roth et al. 2005, PASP 117, 620; Kelz et al. 2006, PASP 
118, 129) mounted at the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope. Observations started 
about 7.5 hours after the burst and were performed with the V300 grating, 
covering the wavelength region from about 300 to 710 nm. In the spectrum 
of the optical transient we detect a deep Lyman alpha trough, which was 
also noted by Peterson & Schmidt 2006 (GCN 5223) and Still et al. 2006 
(GCN 5226). We identify absorption lines from Si II, C II and O I at a 
redshift of z=3.711, which we consider as the redshift of the GRB host 
galaxy.
