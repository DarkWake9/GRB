The bright, long GRB 130518A (Fermi-GBM detection: Xiong, GCN 14674;
Fermi-LAT detection: Omodei and Julie McEnery, GCN 14675;
Swift-BAT trigger 556113: Cummings, GCN 14676)
triggered the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at  UT 13:54:50.635(=T0).

The observed light curve shows a bright peak followed by a weaker emission seen
up to T0+24 s with a duration (T90) of about 22 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 7.05 (-0.34, +0.20) x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+11 s was  15.9 (-0.89, +0.61) photons/cm^2/s
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-5 s to T0+30 s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.
the low-energy photon index alpha: -1.42 (-0.18, +0.26),
the high-energy photon index beta: -2.27 (-0.22, +0.12),
and the peak energy Epeak: 550 (-91, +99) keV, (chi^2/d.o.f = 74.0/68).

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 5% systematic error was added
for low energy channels.
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
