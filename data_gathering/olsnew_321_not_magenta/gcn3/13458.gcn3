N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) and D. Krogsrud (Gemini)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 120712A (Page et al. GCN 12454;
using the GMOS-S spectrograph on Gemini-South in good conditions.

Observations began at 2012-7-12 23:43 UT, about 10 hr post-burst.
The spectrum reveals a clear Ly-a break, and many other absorption
features.  A provisional reduction gives a redshift of z=4.15, although
this figure will be refined with better calibration.
