D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno, E. Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L. Ducci (IAAT/ISDC) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 40 s has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 08:21:04  UT of June 26, 2018

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 243.5715  deg
DEC.= 14.7486   deg
with an uncertainty of  1.1   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a measured peak flux of about 2.7 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 2e-6 erg/cm2. We note that both those values are lower limits, due to telemetry saturation at satellite level.
This burst was also detected by the Swift/BAT, XRT and UVOT (Evans et al., GCN 22850), and the IBIS position is at 33 arc seconds from the UVOT one.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
