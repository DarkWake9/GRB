S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift team reports:
 
The Swift-BAT trigger 582894 was caused by a known flare star HR 1099,
and is not due to a GRB.  It was a 28-min image trigger. There was no
immediate slew because of Earth limb constraint.
At T+48 min, Swift did slew and XRT detected HR 1099.

[GCN OPS NOTE(08apr14):  Per author's request, the Subject-line
was changed from "HD 1099" to "HR 1099". Appreciations to F.Marshall
for bringing our error to our attention.]
