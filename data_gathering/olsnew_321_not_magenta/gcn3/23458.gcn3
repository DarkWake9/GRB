N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) and W. Fong (Northwestern Univ.)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 181126A (Sonbas et al.
GCN 23453) with the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea,
beginning 2018-11-26 14:11 UT, approximately 4.3 hr post-burst.
Images were obtained in the z filter using GMOS-N with total
exposure of 15x60s.

No credible afterglow is visible at the revised X-ray position
(Beardmore et al. GCN 23455) to a 3-sigma magnitude z(AB)=25.4,
uncorrected for Galactic extinction.

We thank Mirko Simunovic and Christy Cunningham for
efficiently executing these observations.
