The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:30:25 UT on 21 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220721A (trigger 680056230.386204 / 220721021).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 356.6, Dec = -39.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 46m, -39d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25.0 degrees.
