A. N. Morgan (UC Berkeley) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 130606A (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 14781) with the
1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began at
2013-Jun-07 06h01m22s UT, ~8.9 hours after the Swift Trigger.  In  mosaics
(effective exposure time of ~36.3 minutes) taken simultaneously in the J,
H, and Ks filters, we detect the optical afterglow (e.g. Jelinek, et al.,
GCN 14782; Xu et al., GCN 14783; Nagayama et al., GCN 14784).

The preliminary photometry yields:

post burst
t_mid (hr) exp.(m)  filt  mag   m_err
9.44       36.3     J     17.83  0.06
9.44       36.3     H     17.06  0.07
9.44       36.3     Ks    16.4   0.1

Observations are ongoing. All magnitudes are given in the Vega system,
calibrated to 2MASS. No correction for Galactic extinction has been made to
the above reported values.
