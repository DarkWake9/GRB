Moore J., Dodson R. (UWA) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160630A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 702252) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 6.4h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
64 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+6.4h to t0+8.0h : Rlim = 21.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
