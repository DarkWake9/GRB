J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Melandri
(INAF-OAB) and E. Troja report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 10 ks of XRT data for GRB 170205A (Troja et al. GCN
Circ. 20603), from 271 s to 34.9 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 20610).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.89 (+0.03, -0.04).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.87 (+0.14, -0.13). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.4 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 2.0 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.1 x 10^-11 (5.7 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.4 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.0 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 3.8 sigma
Photon index:	     1.87 (+0.14, -0.13)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.89, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.021 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 8.5 x
10^-13 (1.2 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
