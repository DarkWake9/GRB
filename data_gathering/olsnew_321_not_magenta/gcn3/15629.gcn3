TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  15629
SUBJECT: GRB 131229A: KAIT Optical Upper Limit

FROM:    Weikang Zheng at UC Berkeley  <zwk@astro.berkeley.edu>

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 131229A (Page et al.,
GCN 15627) starting at 06:41:34 UT, 130 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
V, I, and clear(roughly R) filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. Compared to the DSS image, we do not detect
new sources within XRT error circle. Typical limiting magnitude
of our single clear image is about 19.4. We marginally detected
the source mentioned by Perley (GCN 15628) in our single clear
image with mag around 19.3, and confirming its non-changing
brightness.

[GCN OPS NOTE(29dec13): Per author's request, the "110 s after the burst"
was changed to "130".]
