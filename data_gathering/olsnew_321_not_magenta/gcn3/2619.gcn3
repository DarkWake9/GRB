V.Rumyantsev (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have obtained 10 unfiltered images (180 s exposure each) of the GRB040624
error box (S. Mereghetti et al., GCN 2613). The images were taken with the
AT-64 telescope  of Crimean Astrophysical observatory and cover the period
UT
19:13:00 - 20:21:00 of  June 25, 2004.

 Due to a quality of exposures a combined image comprises only 3 out of
total 10 images, and limiting magnitude of the combined image (S/N=3) is
estimated as following

Start time (UT)       telescope   exposure    limiting mag.
Jun. 25  19:13        AT-64     3x180 s       18.7


No OT was  found in comparison with DSS2.
