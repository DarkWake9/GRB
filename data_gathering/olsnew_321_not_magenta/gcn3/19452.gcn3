The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160321A (Stamatikos et al., GCN 19211) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 21.70, Mar 22.85, Mar 
24.74, Mar 29.66, and Mar 31.68 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Beardmore et al., GCN 19213), with 3sigma upper limits 
of 195 uJy, 261 uJy, 162 uJy, 207 uJy, and 189 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
