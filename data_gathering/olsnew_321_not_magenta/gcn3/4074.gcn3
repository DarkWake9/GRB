collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 051008 (GCN 4069) with the Very Large Array 
at 8.5 GHz beginning October 8.86 UT (~4 hours after the burst). No radio 
source is detected within the XRT error circle (GCN 4073) with a 2-sigma 
upper limit of 80 uJy.

We find one source above the 4-sigma level in the BAT error circle at

RA(J2000) 13:31:22.92  +/-  0.07
DEC      +42:04:31.7   +/-  0.3

with a flux density of 175 +/- 40 uJy. However, the probability of finding 
a source of this brightness in a region with 3-arcmin radius is ~54% 
(Fomalont et al., 2002, ApJ, 123, 2402).
