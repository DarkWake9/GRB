NUMBER:  1818
SUBJECT: GRB 030115 : Possible IR counterpart

Andrew Levan (U. Leicester/STScI), Mike Merrill (NOAO), Evert Rol
(U. Amsterdam), Ian Dell'Antonio (Brown), James Rhoads and Andrew
Fruchter (STScI) report for a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 030115 (GCN 1816) with the KPNO 2.1m
telescope, beginning at Jan 15th 08:27 UT (5.1 hours after bursts). Two
epochs of imaging, approximately 4 hours apart, were obtained in each of
J,H and K.

A PSF matched image subtraction reveals a fading point source at a
position of

RA = 11:18:32.6, Dec= +15:02:59

The source is fixed on the sky and seen to fade in all bands,
although unfortunately we do not currently have a reliable photometric
calibration.

An object is present at a position roughly consistent with the radio
source detected in GCN 1817. However this source does not vary throughout
our observations.

K-band images of the field and possible transient are posted at

http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/030115

Detailed analysis of the dataset is underway, and further observations
are planned.
