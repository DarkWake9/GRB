Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160716A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 704572) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 43.6s after the GRB trigger
(15.6s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
44 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
In the error box of XRT provided by Evans et al. (GCNC 19717)
we do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+43.6s to t0+103.6s : Rlim = 16.7

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+117.4s to t0+147.4s : Rlim = 17.5

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+117.4s to t0+412.5s : Rlim = 18.2

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=301.8222 lat= +1.4859
and the galactic extinction in R band is about magnitudes.
