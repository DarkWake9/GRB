G. Masi, the Virtual Telescope Project - Italy, reports:

I started observations of GRB 140709A (Hagen et al. GCN  16546) with the 17" 
robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope (Ceccano, Italy) at 02:04:00 UT, 3000 
seconds after the burst.

An optical source is visible where described by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 16554) 
in a image coming from the sum of three, 180-seconds exposures, unfiltered. The 
position of the source is RA: 20h18m38.94s +51d13'29.9" (J2000.0, mean residuals 
of 0.2") and the magnitude was estimated to be 21.0, assuming R mags for the 
reference stars from UCAC-4.

The message may be cited.
