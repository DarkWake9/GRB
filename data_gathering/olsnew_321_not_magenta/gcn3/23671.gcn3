report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:24:49.21 UT on 10 January 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190110A(trigger 568833894/ 190110726),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Sbarufatti et al. 2019, GCN
23670).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright peak
with a duration (T90) of about 9 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.04 s to T0+10.24 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 73 +/- 8 keV,
alpha = -0.44 +/- 0.20 and beta = -2.12 +/- 0.08.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.331 +/- 0.209)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+3.71 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 14.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
