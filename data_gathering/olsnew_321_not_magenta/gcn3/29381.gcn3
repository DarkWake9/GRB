and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

A burst from SGR 1935+2154,  that is currently in an active state (e.g. GCN
29365, 29373, 29374, 29377), has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI
data at 12:54:26.71 UT of February 2, 2021.

The burst had a single peak lasting about 50 ms and  a fluence of  1.14e-7
+/- 0.14e-7  erg/cm^2 in the 30-100 keV energy range.

The off-line analysis confirmed the  coordinates derived by IBAS and
distributed in real time in the alert packet (n. 8965) that associated this
event with SGR 1935+2154
