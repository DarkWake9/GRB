(i.e. the Swift-BAT team):

We report further analysis of GRB 141205A (Cummings, GCN 17137).  The best
BAT position is RA, Dec  92.859, +37.876, which is:

RA (J2000)    06 11 26.1s
Dec (J2000)  +37d 52' 32.2"

with an estimated position uncertainty of 2 arcmin radius.  The source was
41% coded in BAT.

The unweighted lightcurve shows multiple weak peaks.  T90 was 1.1 +- 0.2
seconds.

The total spectrum in  BAT is best fit by a simple power-law function with
a photon index of 0.985 +- 0.002.  The fluence in 1.4 seconds was
(1.2 +- 0.3) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.  Errors are 90% confidence.

Because this burst was found in ground analysis, the normal automated burst
analysis products are not available.
