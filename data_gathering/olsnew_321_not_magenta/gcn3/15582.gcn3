J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

The Swift-BAT trigger 580319 (at 17:58:20 UT) is not due to an 
astrophysical event.  This peak is due to a source that was
misidentified as a result of a known race condition in the 
onboard software.
