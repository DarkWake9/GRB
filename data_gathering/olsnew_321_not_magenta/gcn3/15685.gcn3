Zhao, J. Bai, Ch. Wang, Y. Xin (Yunnan National Astronomical Observatory,
China) and Ch. Cui (Beijing National Astronomical Observatory, China), on
behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB 140102A by Swift (Hagen et al., GCNC
15653) and Fermi (Sonbas et al. GCNC 15659), the robotic 0.6m MET
telescope at the BOOTES-4 station, in Lijiang Astronomical Observatory
(China) responded to the event with the first images being obtained 30s
post-burst. At the position of the optical afterglow detected by
Swift/UVOT we detect a source
rapidly decaying in brightness, with R = 14.0 about 70s after the burst
trigger time. Detailed analysis of the whole BOOTES-4 dataset is ongoing."
