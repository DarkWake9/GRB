D. A. Frail (NRAO), and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the VLA to image the error box of the short/hard burst
GRB021201 localized by the IPN (GCN #1719) at a frequency of 1.43 GHz.
There is a 2 mJy source in the error box at J2000, r.a.=08:07:47.537,
dec.=+21 14 54.53 which had been previously cataloged in September
1998 by the FIRST survey (http://sundog.stsci.edu/top.html). There are
no new sources to a 3-sigma level of 0.5 mJy.

Observations at higher frequencies are planned when it stops snowing."
