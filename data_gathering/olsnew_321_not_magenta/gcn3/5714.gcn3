L. Vetere, C. Pagani, D. N. Burrows (PSU) and P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:


The WT spectrum of GRB 061007 given in GCN 5712 has been erroneously computed.
The correct values are given in following paragraphs.

A power-law fit to the WT spectrum gives a photon index of  2.1 +/- 0.2 and a
column density of (1.4 +/- 0.2)e21 cm**-2. We note the galactic hydrogen column
density in the direction of the burst is  2.13e20cm**-2. The 0.2-10.0 keV
observed mean flux during WT observation is 1.5e-09 ergs cm**-2 s**-1, which
corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 2.2e-09 ergs cm**-2 s**-1.

If the burst continues decaying at the current rate we estimate an XRT
count rate of 0.0069 counts/s at T + 24hr, which corresponds to an
observed 0.2-10.keV flux of 4.2e-13 ergs cm**-2 s**-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
