NUMBER:  7095
SUBJECT: ATCA radio observations of short hard burst GRB 071112B 
DATE:    07/11/15 16:56:36 GMT

Mark H. Wieringa (Australia Telescope National Facility), Poonam
Chandra (UVA/NRAO), and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the region centered on the Swift burst GRB 071112B (GCN 7058)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array starting at UT 7.0 Nov 14, 07
and ending at UT 15.0 Nov 14, 07. No emission was seen at a frequency of
8.7 GHz within the BAT error circle. The 5-sigma detection limits in BAT
error circle are 235 uJy. The map noise is 47 uJy."

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia
Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
