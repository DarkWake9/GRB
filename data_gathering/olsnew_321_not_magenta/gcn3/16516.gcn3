A. Corsi (GWU / TTU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:
 
We imaged the position of GRB 140703A (Kocevski et al., GCN 16503) with the 
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in K-band, starting at about 8.5 hours after 
the burst. A provisional reduction shows a source consistent with the location of the 
GRB X-ray and optical afterglows (Goad et al., GCN 16506; Cunniffe et al., GCN 16504). 
At this time, we estimate a preliminary flux of about 280 uJy at 19 GHz.
 
Further observations are planned.
