E. Berger (Carnegie), A. Romanowsky (Concepcion), and C. Vega (Catolica) 
report:

"We observed the error circle of GRB 061217 (GCN #5926) with IMACS on the 
Magellan 6.5-m telescope for a total of 600 sec in R-band starting on 2006 
Dec. 17.27 UT.  A comparison to DSS reveals no new object to the limit of 
the Sky Survey.  We note the presence of a compact galaxy group at:
 	RA = 10:41:50.835
 	DEC= -21:05:16.68  (J2000)
This group is also apparent in the DSS images of this field.  Given past 
associations of short GRBs with galaxy groups and clusters, this galaxy 
group may be the host of the short GRB.  Further observations are 
planned."
