We analysed 15.5ks of Photon Counting data for GRB 071101 (McBreen et
al. GCN Circ. 7030).  Using Swift-XRT PC data, Pagani (GCN Circ. 7034)
reported a faint X-ray source in the BAT error circle.

The X-ray light-curve for this source can be fitted by a power-law from
T+85s to T+4.1e4s, with an initial decay index of 0.9 ± 0.3. So, this
source is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 071101.

The Photon Counting spectrum can modelled as an absorbed power-law, with
Gamma = 2.9 +2.5/-1.7 and a total absorbing column of NH = (2.0
+2.8/-1.6)e22 cm-2. The Galactic value is 5.7e21 cm-2 in the direction
of the burst. The 1-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux during this time
is 1.4e-13(3.2e-13) erg cm-2 s-1.

Assuming the source continues to decay with the same decay index of 0.9,
we predict an XRT count rate of 6.4e-4 counts/s at T+24 hours, which
corresponds to an observed 1-10keV flux of 6.8E-14 ergs cm-2 s-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
