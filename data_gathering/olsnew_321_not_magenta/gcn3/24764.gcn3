report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:55:07.76 UT on the 6th of June 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst 
Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190606A 
(trigger 581478912 / 190606080), which was also detected by AGILE 
(Ursi et al. 2019, GCN 24759) and the LAT (Bissaldi et al. 2019, GCN 24761).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a bright short spike with a duration (T90) of 
about 0.3 s (10-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to 
T0+0.3 s is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 1779 +/- 185 keV, 
alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.02, and beta = -2.52 +/- 0.21

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(4.88 +/- 0.08)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-msec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 118 +/- 3 ph/s/cm^2."

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
