report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:59:01.51 UT on 23 February 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160223B (trigger 477914345 / 160223416),
which was also detected by INTEGRAL (GÃ¶tz et al. 2016, GCN 19059)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 49 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a structured pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 17 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.560 s to T0+16.896 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.90 (+0.08/-0.07)  and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 560 (+110 /-80) keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.9 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.256 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
