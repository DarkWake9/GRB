collaboration report:

We observed the error box of GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN5162) in Nordic
Optical Telescope with ALFOSC between (UT)  June 05 23:37 and June 06 00:41.
We do not detect the optical afterglow. Limiting magnitude of a combined
image of total exposure 10x300  is R~ 24.6.  Based on last 3 points of TT150
(Khamitov et al.  GCNs 5186, 5189, 5193) the limiting magnitude R=24.6 at
mid time (UT) June 06.0125 (T0+10.486d) is compatible with X-ray power law
decay index   2.8+/-0.1 (Moretti et al., GCN5194). While no sources are
detected within refined XRT error circle  (Campana et. GCN5168)  faint
galaxy (R=24.4 +/- 0.3) is detected at (J2000) RA = 15:31:18.2  Dec =
+00:17:12.7.  Taking into account redshift of the OT of GRB060526 z=3.21
(Berger and Gladders GCN5170) it is unlikely that the
detected galaxy is connected with GRB060526.
