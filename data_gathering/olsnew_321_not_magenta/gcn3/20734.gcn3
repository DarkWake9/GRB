behalf of a larger collaboration.

We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of EM
candidates. Observations were made with the SPRAT spectrograph, and
supernova classifications were obtained using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024).

iPTF17bam was observed on 2017-02-22 at 23:04UT. The transient is centrally
located within its host galaxy and the spectrum is indicative of an AGN.

iPTF17bds was observed on 2017-02-24 at 04:36UT. We classify this transient
as a type Ia SN at +8 days with z=0.203.

PS17bfg was observed on 2017-02-24 at 03:46UT. We classify this transient
as a type Ia SN at +15 days with z=0.140. The galaxy 2MASX
J11453974+3323354 at a separation of 0.064 arcmin has catalogue z=0.141258.

PTSS17gpm was observed on 2017-02-24 at 05:02UT. We classify this transient
as a type Ia SN at +1 days with z=0.080.

iPTF17beb was observed on 2017-02-24 at 05:53UT. We classify this transient
as a type II SN at +17 days with z=0.056.


We also observed the following targets. In these targets the spectrum seems
to be dominated by the host galaxy and we see no evidence of a transient
above the host galaxy emission in the acquisition images. In the majority
of cases the transient coordinates are very close to the centre of the host
galaxy.

iPTF17bah was observed on 2017-02-23 at 00:33UT.
iPTF17baz was observed on 2017-02-24 at 01:07UT.
PS17bfc was observed on 2017-02-24 at 02:04UT.
iPTF17bdl was observed on 2017-02-24 at 02:44UT.
iPTF17bdd was observed on 2017-02-24 at 03:41UT.
iPTF17bec was observed on 2017-02-24 at 05:33UT.
