The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:


We identified the compact binary merger candidate S190727h during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-07-27
06:03:33.986 UTC (GPS time: 1248242631.986). The candidate was found
by the GstLAL [1], CWB [2], PyCBC Live [3], MBTAOnline [4], and SPIIR
[5] analysis pipelines.

S190727h is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 1.4e-10 Hz, or about one in 1e2
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190727h

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (92%), Terrestrial (5%), MassGap (3%), NSBH (<1%),
or BNS (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong
evidence against the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar
masses (HasNS: <1%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the
signal, there is strong evidence against matter outside the final
compact object (HasRemnant: <1%).

One sky map is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 8 minutes after the candidate

For the bayestar.fits.gz sky map, the 90% credible region is 841
deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity
distance estimate is 2022 +/- 516 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

Note that the preliminary GCN notice incorrectly reported
the classification as 99% Terrestrial, and the incorrect skymap was
associated with the event. These have now been corrected.
