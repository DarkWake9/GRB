The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:56:43 UT on 25 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191125A (trigger 596350608.13565 / 191125206).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 243.1, Dec = -13.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 12m, -13d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
