The short-duration GRB 170219A (Roberts et al., GCN Circ. 20706; Frederiks et al.,
GCN Circ. 20703; INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7701) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:03:06.76 on 19 February 2017.  The burst signal was seen
by all CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing
script, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The peak starts and peaks
at T0-0.2 sec and ends at T+0.5 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 0.25 +- 0.18 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
