The long bright GRB 061007 (Swift-BAT trigger #232683;
Schady et al., GCN 5707; Markwardt et al., GCN 5713)
triggered Konus-Wind at 2006-10-07 T0=36489.344 s UT (10:08:09.344).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~90 s,
fluence 2.49(-0.12, +0.17)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
the 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+39.488
1.95(-0.24, +0.31)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB
(from T0 to T0+87.296 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha =  -0.70 +/- -0.04,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.61 (-0.21, +0.15),
the peak energy Ep = 399 (-18, +19) keV (chi2 = 97/84 dof).

The spectrum of the burst maximum
(accumulated from T0+38.656 s to T0+40.704 s)
is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.53 (-0.08, +0.09),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.61 (-0.49, +0.25),
the peak energy Ep = 498 (-48, +54) keV (chi2 = 51/66 dof).

Assuming z = 1.26 (Osip al., GCN 5715; Jakobsson et al., GCN 5716)
and a standard cosmology
model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, Omega_\Lambda = 0.7,
the isotropic energy release is E_iso ~1.0x10^54 erg, and
the maximum luminosity is (L_iso)_max ~1.8x10^53 erg/s.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
