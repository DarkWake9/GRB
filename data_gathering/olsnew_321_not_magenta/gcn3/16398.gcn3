We observed a field of the GBM GRB 140606B / iPTF 14bfu (Singer et al., 
GCN 16360) with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory 
starting on June, 07 (UT) 21:40:06. We obtained several unfiltered 
frames with exposure of each frame of 120 s. The  optical transient   is 
well detected on the stacked image.
