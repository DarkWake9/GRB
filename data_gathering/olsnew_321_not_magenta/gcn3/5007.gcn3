"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060427 (GCN 5006) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 11:44:48 UT on Apr.27(98sec after the Swift trigger).
After co-adding a set of 13 images (11:44:48 - 12:00:21 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 15.1 mag."
