WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 180324A (Sonbas et al.,
GCN 22524) starting at 04:54:12 UT, ~17 minutes after the burst,
and lasted ~10 minutes before it reached the physical limit of the
telescope.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within
the enhanced XRT position error circle (Evans et al., GCN 22525).
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
19.0 mag calibrated to the APASS catalog.
