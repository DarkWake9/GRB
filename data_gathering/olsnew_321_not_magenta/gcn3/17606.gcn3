T. Laskar and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed GRB 150314A (Hagen et al; GCN 17573) with the VLA beginning on
2015 March 17.2 UT (3.0 days after the burst). No significant radio
emission is detected at the enhanced Swft/XRT position (Beardmore et al.;
GCN 17575) or the optical position (Zheng et al.; GCN 17574). We therefore
confirm the radio source reported in our previous observations (Laskar et
al.; GCN 17591) as the radio afterglow. No further follow-up observations
are planned."
