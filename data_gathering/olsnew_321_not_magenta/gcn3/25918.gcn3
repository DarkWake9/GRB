We observed the field of the candidate afterglow of GRB 191001A (trigger
591604915, Fermi GBM Team, GCN Circ. 25893, Pereyra et al. GCN Circ.
25911), centered at 20:20:47.65 +15:05:03.4,  with the Reionization and
Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2019/10 2.12 to 2019/10 2.17 UTC (20.08 to 21.45 hours
after the Fermi trigger), obtaining a total of 0.34 hours exposure in the g
and r bands, 0.67 hours exposure in the i band and 0.37 hours exposure in
the i, Z, Y, J, and H bands.

At the position of the transient source AT2019rog discovered independently
by ATLAS and DDOTI, in comparison with the USNO-B1, PS1 and 2MASS catalogs,
we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  g > 23.20
  r > 23.01
  i > 23.26
  Z > 21.40
  Y > 21.49
  J > 21.22
  H > 20.92

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The non-detection implies that the source has faded by about 6 magnitudes
in 20 hours. This is consistent with it being the afterglow of GRB 191001A.

Mártir.
