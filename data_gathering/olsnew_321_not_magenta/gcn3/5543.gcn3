  The bright, long burst, GRB 060904A (Swift-BAT trigger #227996;
  D. Grupe et al., GCN 5502; Krimm et al., GCN 5516), triggered
  the Suzaku Wideband All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy
  range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 01:04:09.040 (UT).
  The three little peaks and following large peak (GCN 5502) are
  clearly seen in the light curve observed with the WAM.
  The T90 duration was ~79 seconds.
  The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 8.66(-4.19 +0.39)x10-6 erg/cm2,
  while the 1-s peak flux was 2.07(-1.12 +0.09) photons/cm2/s in the
   same energy range.

  Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum is
  well described with a single power-law model with the energy index
  of 1.16 (-0.18 0.20).

   All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
  in which systematic errors are not included.
