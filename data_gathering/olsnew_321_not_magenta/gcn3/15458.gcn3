We have analysed 8.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 131105A (Cummings  et al.
GCN Circ. 15446),  from 276 s to 36.2 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 7 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (taken while Swift was
slewing), with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced
XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN. Circ
15448).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=8.0 (+0.0, -1.5). At T+353 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of 0.62 (+/-0.04) before breaking again at T+21.4
ks to a final decay with index alpha=2.3 (+0.9, -0.8).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.22 (+0.16, -0.15). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.2 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 2.9 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.5 x 10^-11 (5.9 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     2.2 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.9 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 7.5 sigma
Photon index:	     2.22 (+0.16, -0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.3, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 3.4 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.2 x
10^-13 (2.0 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
