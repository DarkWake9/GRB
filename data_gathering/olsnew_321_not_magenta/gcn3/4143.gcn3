report:

"We have observed the HETE-2 error box for GRB 051022
(Olive et al., GCNC 4131) with the 1.5 m  Carlos Sánchez
telescope at Tenerife, Spain. 30 min exposures in the J and
Ks-band filters were taken starting on October 22 (01:56 UT,
i.e. 12.8 hr after the GRB). Within the SWIFT X-ray error
box (Racusin et al., GCNC 4141), we detect two objects,
at coordinates (J2000):

#A RA= 23 56 04.10 Dec= +19 36 27.9

#B RA= 23 56 04.18 Dec =+19 36 23.1


Preliminary error is 1.0". Object #A seems to be present in
the DSS-2 (IR). Object #B seems much redder than #A and
marginally consistent with another possible source seen in
the DSS-2 (IR).

Additional observations in the near-IR are requested to
confirm if object #B is the nIR afterglow to GRB 051022.
An ID-chart will be posted at
