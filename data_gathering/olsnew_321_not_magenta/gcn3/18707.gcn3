S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) and D. A. Perley (DARK/NBI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of the optical afterglow (Cenko et al., GCN 18692) of GRB151215A (Gibson et al., GCN 18691) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations were obtained in the r', i', and z' filters beginning at 3:41 UT on 16 December 2015 (1.0 d after the Swift trigger).  We do not detect any emission at the location of the afterglow in any filter.  Using nearby point sources from SDSS for calibration, we calculate an upper limit of i' > 21.7 mag at a mean epoch of 1.04 d after the burst.
