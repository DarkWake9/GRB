TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1874
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030218 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 42158 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 200
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.6E-05 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  1.9E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 351.179, -41.826 degrees, whose radius is 55.834 +/-  0.019
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus can be improved and/or constrained, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
