Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190719C (trigger #915381)
(Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 25106).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 240.208, 13.005 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 00m 49.8s
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 00' 18.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T0 and ends at ~T+200 s. The main peak occurs at ~T0. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 185.7 +- 9.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.09 to T+201.96 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.64 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.27 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
