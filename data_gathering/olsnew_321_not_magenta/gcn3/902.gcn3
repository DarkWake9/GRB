GRB 001212 optical observation

R. Ishioka, M. Uemura, K. Matsumoto, H. Iwamatsu, T. Kato (Kyoto Univ.) and
H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ.) report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collabolation:

"We have observed the central region of the IPN error box of GRB
001212 (GCN 899) with 20 x 30s exposures (no filter) using the 25-cm
telescope at Kyoto under the strong moonlight.  The starting time of
the exposure is Dec. 14.64 UT, which is about 2.0 days after the GRB
event.  The preliminary reduction yields that the limiting magnitude
of the individual image was mag about 16.0.  Comparing with Digital
Sky Survey 2nd generation R image, no new distinct object has been
detected within and around the central region of the error box.
Further analysis will be carried out."
