V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up
collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB061019 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 5728)  with Shajn
2.6m telescope of CrAO. A set of  R-exposures was taken on October 20,
between (UT) 00:07 - 01:47.   Near refined XRT error circle (Guidorzi et
al., GCN 5733) we found a single object in coordinates (J2000) RA=06 06
30.17   Dec=+29 34 10.50, uncertainties in both coordinates are about 1". A
photometry of the object in a combined image (86x60 s) against USNO A2.0
star (RA=06 06 31.89  Dec=+29 34 58.20  R=18.5) is 22.22+/-0.05, and 3 sigma
limiting magnitude is R=24.5. At present time it is not clear whether the
object is connected with afterglow (Covino et al., GCN 5730; Cobb et al.,
GCN 5734).
