The late Swift/XRT observations of GRB 140206A (1,2) evidences the
fullfillment of the IGC paradigm (3,4). A preliminary overlapping of
its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity with the one of GRB
090618, namely an IGC prototype (5), gives an estimate of the redshift
of z~0.6 (see Fig. 1 <http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB140206A.pdf>).

As a consequence, a supernova associated to GRB 140206A is expected to
emerge after 16 days after the trigger.

Continuous monitoring and complementary observations in all possible
wavelengths are encouraged.
