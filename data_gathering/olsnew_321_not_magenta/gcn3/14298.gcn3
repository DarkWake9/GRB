D. Xu (DARK/NBI) and C. Cao, S.-M. Hu (SDU) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130313A (Gompertz et al., GCN 14293) with
the 1m telescope located in Weihai, Shandong Province, China.
Observations started at 17:41:25 UT on 2013-03-13 (i.e., 1.554 hr
after the BAT trigger) and 5x600s R-band images were obtained.

No optical source is detected within the XRT error circle (Gompertz &
Page, GCN 14297) in the stacked image, down to a limit of R>20.5 mag
calibrated with nearby USNO B1 stars.

We thank Chang-Ming Zhang for carrying out these observations.
