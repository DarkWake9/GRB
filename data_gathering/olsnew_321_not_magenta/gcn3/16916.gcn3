Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141015A (trigger #615399)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 16909).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 87.535, 18.370 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 50m 08.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +18d 22' 12.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 98%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows s single FRED-like pulse starting 
at ~T_0, peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+12 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 11.0 +- 4.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.00 to T+13.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.90 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
