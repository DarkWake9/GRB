TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  11961
SUBJECT: GRB 110422A: NOT optical observation

Dong Xu (WIS), Anders Thygesen, Fatemeh Kiaee (NOT), and Pall
Jakobsson (U. Iceland) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 110422A (Mangano  et al., GCN 11957) at
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. We obtained
2x300 s R-band images with a median time 21:11:33.3 UT (i.e., 5.49397
hr after the BAT trigger). The images, with an airmass ~1.5,  were
taken under the windy condition.

A new optical source is detected at coordinates

(RA,Dec)(J2000.0) = (07:28:11.06, +75:06:25.00)
(error-radius:  ~ 0.1 arcsec),

being consistent with the finding in Elunko et al. (GCN 11958) and
Gres et al. (GCN 11960). Note that this position is southwest of and
outside the XRT error circle reported at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/.
The source has R~20.0 mag, calibrated with the #1651-0050630 star
(R1=19.08) in the USNO B1 catalog.

Further observation is planned as long as the weather could stay
observable at La Palma.
