The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:15:20 UT on 24 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200924A (trigger 622631725.82437 / 200924386).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 317.3, Dec = -56.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 09m, -56d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102.0 degrees.
