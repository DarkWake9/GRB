We observed the field of GRB 061028 detected by SWIFT
trigger no. 235715 (Sakamoto et al, GCN 5762) with CCD
detector at our 1.02 meter telescope of the Yunnan observatory,
Kunming, China. 
We started our observation on Oct. 29, 2006 at UT 18:06:20.
We took 6 image frames of 300 seconds exposure time of each in
the optical R passband. 
There is no detection of optical afterglow candidate in our
combined 6 images. The 5-sigma limiting magnitude of our observations
is R ~ 20.0 mag.
