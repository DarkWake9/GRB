report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:16:35.39  UT on 19 April 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160419A (trigger 482771799 / 160419.637), which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (C. B. Markwardt et al. 2016, GCN 19326).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time using the Swift BAT position is about 127 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a weak burst with a
duration (T90) of about 24 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-1.3 s to T0+2.7 s is best fit by a power
law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff function,
with Epeak = 438 +/- 118 keV and alpha = -0.49 +/- 0.28.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.675 +/- 0.221)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1s peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-1.15 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.92 +/- 0.25 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
