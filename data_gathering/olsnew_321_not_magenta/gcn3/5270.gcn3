TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB050326: Host Galaxy Candidates

L.J. Pellizza (CEA Saclay, France & IAFE, Argentina), P.-A.
Duc (CEA Saclay, France), E. Le Floc'h (Steward Obs., USA),
& I.F. Mirabel (ESO), on behalf of the MISTICI
collaboration.

We imaged the field of GRB 050326 (Markwardt et al. 2005,
GCN 3143) on June 5, 2005. Ks (42 x 60 seconds) frames were
obtained with ISAAC at VLT. In the combined frame we detect
two objects within the revised XRT error circle (Moretti et
al. 2006, A&A, 448, L9). These objects are barely above our
3-sigma limiting magnitude Ks_lim ~ 21. Their positions are
RA(J2000) = 00:27:49.7, DEC(J2000) = -71:22:12.6 (object 1)
and RA(J2000) = 00:27:49.5, DEC(J2000) = -71:22:12.3
(object 2) (0.5 arcsec error). Both astrometry and
photometry were calibrated against 2MASS stars.
