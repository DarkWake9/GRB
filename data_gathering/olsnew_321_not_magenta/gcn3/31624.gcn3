D. Svinkin, D. Frederiks, A. Ridnaia, A. Lysenko,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 220219B
has been detected by Konus-Wind (KW) and Swift (BAT), so far,
at about 34045 s UT (09:27:25).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-BAT annulus centered at
RA(2000)=314.433 deg (20h 57m 44s) Dec(2000)=-14.987 deg (-14d 59' 15"),
whose radius is 83.789 +/- 1.439 deg (3 sigma).

This localization may be improved.

The position of the optical transient ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva
(Ho et al., GCN Circ. 31619) is inside the annulus at 0.46 deg
from its center line. The OT position is consistent with the Swift-BAT 
detection, Fermi-GBM non-detection, and the KW ecliptic latitude response.

The positional and temporal coincidence of this burst with the OT 
supports the conclusion that the OT is the GRB counterpart.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
