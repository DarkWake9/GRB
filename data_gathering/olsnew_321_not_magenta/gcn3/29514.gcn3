on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long-duration GRB 210212B
(ZTF OT detection: Yao et al., GCN Circ. 29508;
IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 29511)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single emission episode
which starts at about T0=9479 s UT (02:37:59)
and has the total duration of ~48 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB210212_T09477/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
8.7(-1.1,+1.7)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0, of 6.7(-1.6,+4.8)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0 to T0+48 s) is well described by
a cutoff power-law model with
alpha = -1.24(-0.23,+0.33) and Ep = 208(-46,+84) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
