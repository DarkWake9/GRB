The long-duration GRB 151006A (Kocevski et al., GCN Circ. 18398; Cummings  et al., 
GCN Circ. 18409; Roberts & Meegan, GCN Circ. 18404; Golenetskii et al., GCN Circ. 18413; 
Bhalerao et al., GCN Circ. 18422) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) 
at 09:54:59.97 UT on 6 October 2015.   The clear burst signal was detected by the Soft 
Gamma-ray Monitor (SGM; 30 keV - 20 MeV) which is a scintillation detector utilized a BGO 
crystal.  Due to a large incident angle of the event, no signal was detected by the Hard X-ray 
Monitor (HXM; 7 keV - 1 MeV) which is a scintillation detector composed of a LaBr3(Ce) crystal.  

The SGM light curve shows two spikes peaking at T0-2s and T0+2s, and the emission ending 
around T0+~60s.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 63 +- 5 s (30 - 1000 keV).  

Currently, CALET is in the commissioning phase.  Further information about CALET and 
CGBM can be found at http://calet.jp/en/ and http://www.en.yoshida-agu.net/research/calet-gbm
