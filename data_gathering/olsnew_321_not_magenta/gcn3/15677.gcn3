We observed GRB 140102A (Swift trigger 582760, Hagen et al. 2014,
GCNC 15653) field with the 1.3m telescope at ARIES, Nainital starting
~ 1.5 hours after the burst. Several frames in V,R_c and I_c pass-bands
were obtained in clear sky conditions.

The candidate optical afterglow (Hagen et al. 2014, GCNC 15653; Xu et al.
2014, GCNC 15655) was clearly seen in our frames. The
photometry of the first R_c frame yields afterglow brightness to be ~ 19
mag.

The nearby USNO stars have been used for calibrate.
