We obtained a spectrum of the transient PS19qu discovered by Pan-STARRS (Smith et al., GCN 24262)  during follow-up of the gravitational wave trigger S190425z (GCN 24168) , under the advanced Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (ePESSTO+; see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40 http://www.pessto.org). The observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla with the EFOSC2 instrument.

The spectrum is host-galaxy dominated. It shows a star-forming galaxy at z=0.183, significantly further away than the peak of the distance posterior from the GW sky map (GCN 24168). At this redshift, the absolute magnitude implied by the Pan-STARRS detection is -18.9 mag.
