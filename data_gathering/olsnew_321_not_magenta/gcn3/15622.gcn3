D. Xu (DARK/NBI), T.-M. Zhang, L.-P. Xin, F. Xiao (NAOC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 131227A (Oates et al., GCN 15616) using
the 2.16m Xinglong telescope, equipped with BFOSC and located in
Heibei, China. We obtained 2x600s R-band images with a mean time of
9.086 hr after the BAT trigger.

At the afterglow position (Zheng et al., GCN 15617), which is within
the XRT error circle (Evans & Goad, GCN 15618), the afterglow has
decayed to have R>21.2 mag, calibrated with nearby USNO B1 field.
