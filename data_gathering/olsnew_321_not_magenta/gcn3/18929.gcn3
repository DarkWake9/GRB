Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160123A (trigger #671447)
(Malesani, et al., GCN Circ. 18926).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 150.277, -33.790 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 01m 06.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -33d 47' 23.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 68%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows one peak starting at ~T-15 sec, 
peaking at ~T+0.5 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.95 +- 0.62 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.05 to T+3.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.51 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
