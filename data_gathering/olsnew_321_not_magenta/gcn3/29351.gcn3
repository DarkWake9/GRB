SUBJECT: GRB 210123A: Fermi GBM Final Localization
DATE:    21/01/25 21:39:52 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Dunwoody at UCD  <rachel.dunwoody@ucdconnect.ie>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

"At 07:19:03.07 UT on 23 January 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210123A (trigger 633079148 / 210123305).

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS and
the Insight-HXMT/HE (Xue et al. 2019, GCN 29349)

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 345.1, DEC = -56.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 23h 00m, -56d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty
of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110 degrees.
