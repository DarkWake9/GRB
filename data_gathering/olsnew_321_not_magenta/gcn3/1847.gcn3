S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), N.Produit (ISDC), J.Borkowski (ISDC), D.Gotz
(IASF-Milano)  and the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

Further analysis of GRB030131 resulted in a better localization which
differs from the ones previously reported (GCN1836, 1838). Previous
results were affected by the fact that the burst occurred during a
satellite slew.

The new coordinates are RA: 13h 28m 31s DEC: +30deg 40' 45'' with an error
of 5 arcmin radius.

The GRB had a duration of about 150 s and a peak flux over 1 s of about
2x10e-7 erg/cm2/s in the 25-100 keV energy range.
