A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 200423A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 27632)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 609342856) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) at about 50051 s UT (13:54:11).

We have triangulated it to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=234.403 deg (15h 37m 37s)  Dec(2000)=+51.175 deg (+51d 10' 31"),
whose radius is 40.464 +/- 3.464 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi-GBM one.

This localization may be improved.
