At 22:30:26.42 UT, the Swift-BAT instrument triggered (trigger=146129)
on GRB 050715.  The spacecraft did not slew to this new burst
because of the Sun observing constraint (and it will remain in constraint
for 2-3 months).  The BAT flight-determined location is RA,Dec 155.669,-0.059
{+10h 22m 41s, -00d 03' 31"} (J2000) with a 3 armin uncertainty (radius,
90% containment, stat+sys).  The lightcurve has two main peaks separated
by ~35 sec with a total duration of ~70 sec.  There is some evidence
of 1 or 2 more smaller peaks.  The peak count rate is ~1400 cnts/sec
in the 15-350 keV band.
