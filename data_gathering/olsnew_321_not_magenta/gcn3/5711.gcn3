S. B. Pandey and P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) report on behalf of
the Swift-UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began observing the GRB 061006 field (trigger 232585), 129
seconds after the BAT trigger (GCN 5699). No new source was detected
in the co-added UVOT observations down to the following 3-sigma magnitude
upper limits within the refined XRT error circle (GCN 5703):

Filter        T_range (s)    Exposure (s)    3sigma UL

V             129-18315      2131            20.85
B             617-30237      789             21.23
U             593-45827      2534            21.86
W1            569-41793      2902            21.50
M2            545-35908      3462            21.69
W2            633-17402      1318            21.12

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. The upper limits
are not corrected for Galactic extinction E(B-V) = 0.32 mag along
the line of sight to the burst.
