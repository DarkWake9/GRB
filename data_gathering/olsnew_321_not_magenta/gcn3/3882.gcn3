       MASTER (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB 050825 (Swift 
trigger 152038). The first image  was 94 sec after
SWIFT  GRB050825 detection  and 78 sec after notice time  under the good 
weather condition (exp = 1sec). The limit 14.1 .

On next images (unfiltered, close to R, exp.  30 sec) we do no see new 
objects  in comparison to the DSS2  with limit 18.9 .

Our m = 0.89R + 0.11B (R & B from USNO A).
