GRB 161001A (Swift/BAT detection: Page et al., GCN 19967;
Fermi GBM observation: Veres et al., GCN 19973)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=3919.479 s UT (01:05:19.479).

The light curve shows a short pulse with a total duration
of ~0.5 s.
The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(1.8 ± 0.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0-0.016, of (8.0 ± 3.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a cutoff power-law
(CPL) function with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.46(-0.36,+0.48),
and the peak energy Ep = 437(-117,+190) keV,
chi2 = 30.0/36 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep with only an upper limit on beta of -2.1,
chi2 = 30.0/35 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
