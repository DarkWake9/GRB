We performed spectroscopic observations of the GW counterpart candidate
SSS17a/DLT17ck (Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., LVC GCN 21530;
Sheng Yang et al., LVC GCN 21531) with the AAOmega spectrograph at the 4m
Anglo-Australian Telescope.

The AAOmega spectrograph covers a wavelength range 3700-8800 AA with a
resolution R=1700. 

We obtained 4 usable exposures of 600s each, starting at 2017-08-24.037 UT.

A preliminary analysis shows a red, largely featureless spectrum with no
obvious features other than host galaxy absorption lines.
