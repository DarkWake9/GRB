M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 18:29:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151001B (trigger=657321).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 336.845, +64.661, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 27m 23s
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 39' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, there is nothing
significant in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 18:31:55.6 UT, 138.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
336.8384, 64.6937 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 22h 27m 21.22s
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 41' 37.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 118 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (6.51 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 6.8
(+6.23/-4.70) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.89e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 148 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
1.71.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
