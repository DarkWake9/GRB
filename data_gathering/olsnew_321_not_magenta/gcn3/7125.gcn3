TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7125
SUBJECT: GRB 071122: Corrected P60 Coordinates
DATE:    07/11/22 08:18:59 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports:

In our previous circular (GCN 7123), I incorrectly transcribed the
coordinates of the proposed afterglow candidate of GRB071122.  The correct
coordinates are (J2000.0):

	RA: 18:26:25.23
	Dec: +47:04:31.3

I would like to thank Phil Evans for pointing out this typo and apologize
for any inconvenience this may have caused.
