Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201006A (trigger #998907)
(Group et al., GCN Circ. 28560).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 61.917, 65.148 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 07m 40.1s
   Dec(J2000) = +65d 08' 53.3"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 33%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a pulse that starts and peaks at ~T0,
and ends at ~T+0.5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.49 +- 0.09 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.01 to T+0.54 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.42 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-0.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
