We report continuing wide-field near-infrared follow-up observations (GCN #24284)

of the localization region of the gravitational wave event S190426c (GCN

#24237) by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey (Moore and Kasliwal 2019).

Gattini-IR is a newly commissioned near-IR camera with a field of view

of 25 square degrees mounted on a robotic 30 cm telescope at Palomar

observatory.


We started customized Target of Opportunity observations at UT

2019-04-28 03:28. The tiling was optimally determined and triggered

using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a,

Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We imaged a total of 1900 square degrees,

covering 94% of the probability region of the event for 1 to 5 epochs

until UT 2019-04-28 12:33. Each field visit consisted of a sequence of

8 dithers of 8 second exposures each on the field, which were

processed and stacked with the Palomar Gattini-IR data reduction

pipeline (De et al., in prep.). The typical limiting magnitude of each

stacked epoch (64 second exposure time) was between 14.5 and 15.5 AB mag

in J-band, and shallower than usual due to poor weather conditions.

No viable counterparts without previous history of variability were identified.
