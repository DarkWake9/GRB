   We have observed the afterglow of GRB 110223A (Sakamoto 
et al., GCNC 11753) with the 0.6m TELMA/BOOTES-2 located in
Malaga (Spain). R-band observations began 228 seconds after
the burst. We do not detect any source within the XRT error
box down to the following detection limits, as compared with
the USNO-B1.0 catalogue:
