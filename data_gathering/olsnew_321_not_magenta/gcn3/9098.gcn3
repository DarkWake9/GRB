A. Goldstein (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 15:54:41.34 UT on 05 April 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090405 (trigger 260639683 / 090405663).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 226.7, DEC = -5.6 (J2000 degrees, 
equivalent to 15h 07m, -05d 37'), with an uncertainty 
of 9.9 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70 degrees.
This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM lightcurve consists of one peak with a duration of about 1.2 s.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly
constrained."
