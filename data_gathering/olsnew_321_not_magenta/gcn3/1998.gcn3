GRB030329: Upper limits from recent and historical observations.

W. M. Wood-Vasey, P. Nugent, and B. C. Lee, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, using images obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks,
and K. Lawrence (Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion
Laboratory), report recent and historical upper limits for the optical
transient for GRB 20030329 (GCN #1985, 1986, 1987) using the position
of Uemura et. al (GCN #1949) from images taken with the Palomar Oschin
1.2-m and Haleakala MSSS 1.2-m telescopes during the previous two
years:

Magnitudes are calibration against 300 USNO-A V1.0 R-band stars in
the 0.25 sq. degree field of the images.

A co-addition of these images shows nothing at this location to a
combined limiting magnitude of 22.28 (S/N = 3).
