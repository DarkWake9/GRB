V. Mangano (PSU), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC), S. B. Cenko (GSFC),
C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. N. Ukwatta (MSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:13:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
GRB 140607A, (trigger=601051).  Swift did not slew due to the Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 86.380, +18.917, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = +05h 45m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = +18d 55' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers the real-time BAT
light curve shows nothing significant.  However, the image significance
of 7.87 sigma gives us confidence that this is a real event even
in the absence of XRT and UVOT follow-up. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 22:00 UT on 2014 August 05. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vxm22 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
