(i.e. the Swift-BAT team):

Using the data set from T-239 to T+459 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 141212B (trigger #621234) (Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ.
17159). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 250.866, 31.749 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 43m 27.9s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 44' 55.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 77%.

BAT light curve shows a single multi-peaked episode starting
around T+0 sec, and ending around T+15 sec. The two main
peaks of the light curve can be seen at T+5 sec and T+6 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.5 +- 0.7 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.06 to T+12.14 sec is
best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.46 +- 0.09.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.10 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 3.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
