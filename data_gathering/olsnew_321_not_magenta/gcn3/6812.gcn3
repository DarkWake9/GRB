E. Berger (Princeton,OCIW) and W. Krzeminski (LCO) report:

"We observed the BAT error circle of GRB 070920b (GCN 6808) with the Swope 
40-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory starting on 2007 Sep. 21.22 
UT (8.2 hours after the burst).  A total of 30 minutes were obtained in 
R-band in mediocre seeing conditions (~1.5").  A comparison to DSS reveals 
no new objects within the revised BAT error circle (GCN 6811)."
