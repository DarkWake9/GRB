J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Under autonomous operations, we started observing the position of  
GRB 071025a (Pagani et al. GCN 6986) with PAIRITEL at 04:11:08 UT  
(about 58s after receiving the trigger).  In a mosaic of data  
obtained between 2007-10-25 04:12:28 to 2007-10-25 04:21:23 UT, we  
confirm the existence of a bright new source (Rykoff et al. GCN 6987;  
Covino et al. GCN 6988) at position:

       23:40:17.078 +31:46:42.87 (J2000)

with an uncertainty of 250 mas in both axes (relative to 2MASS).  A  
preliminary magnitude is J = 14.948 +/- 0.022. More observations and  
analysis are ongoing."
