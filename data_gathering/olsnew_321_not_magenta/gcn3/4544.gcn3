A. Pelangeon & J-L. Atteia (LATT-OMP) report:

We have used the spectral parameters of GRB 060117
provided by Golenetskii et al. (GCNC 4542) to
compute the spectral pseudo-redshift of this burst
detected by SWIFT-BAT (Campana et al., GCNC 4533;
Cummings et al., GCNC 4538).

We find a pseudo-redshift pz= 0.45 +/- 0.2

This is significantly lower than the pseudo-redshift computed from
the lag-luminosity relation (pz=1.3, GCNC 4538, Cummings et al.).
This small pseudo-redshift suggests that the supernova associated
with GRB 060117 could be detectable.

We encourage observers to follow-up this GRB at various wavelengths
to look for the possible emergence of the supernova.
