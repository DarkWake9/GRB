We observed 16 sky regions (total: 2400 square degrees with overlaps)
to cover the skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S190828l,
with SVOM/GWAC, at Xinglong Observatory equipped with a set of two
types of wide angle cameras: FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 3.5 cm) and JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 18 cm). SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and
16 JFOV cameras, working with unfiltered band. The observations are
operated in time-series mode, taking one exposure every 25 seconds
(20s exposure + 5s readout). We estimate a 9.5% prior probability
that the 16 observed and processed regions contain the true location of
the source.  The images were taken between ~5 hours and ~12 hours after
the event trigger time.

The coordinates of the 16 sky regions and observation times are listed
below:

The weather conditions were hazy during the observations. A 3 sigma
limiting magnitude of about 16.3 mag in R band was obtained in the single 
frames. No credible new source is detected by our online pipeline during 
follow-up observations. A more detailed image analysis including
co-addition is ongoing with our offline pipeline to search for transient
candidates.
