 Kenzo Kinugasa (Gunma Astronomical Observatory),
 Ken'ichi Torii (Osaka University), and Mitsuhiro Kohama (RIKEN),
 report;

 The SXC error region of GRB 040511 (HETE trigger #3218, GCN 2588)
 was automatically observed with the GETS system
 of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory, starting at 2004 May 11, 
 15:18:02 UT. The telescope is 25-cm Schmidt Cassegrain
 equipped with unfiltered CCD camera (AP7p).

 After co-adding a set of 15 frames of 30 sec exposures (mean 
 epoch 15:25:52 UT), we compared the image with the USNO A2.0 
 catalog. We found no new source brighter than R=15 mag in the 
 SXC error region. Also, an upper limit of R=15.1 mag is 
 obtained for the afterglow candidate (Fox, et al. GCN 2597).
