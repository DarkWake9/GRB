R. Forster, M. Wright, J. Hare, J. S. Bloom, G. C. Bower (UC  
Berkeley) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

"Using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA, http://ral.berkeley.edu/ata/),  
we observed GRB 070612A (Grupe et al., GCN 6509) at 1.4 GHz on 2007  
June 16 UT and at 5 GHz on 2007 June 17 UT. The observations made use  
of 8 antennas outfitted with dual-polarization receivers. At the  
location of the optical afterglow (Updike et al., GCN 6515), we   
obtained 3-sigma limits of 50 mJy at 1.4 GHz and 10 mJy at 5 GHz for  
the flux density of GRB 070612A at these epochs.  The data were  
calibrated versus the QSS 0927+392. At L-band the 8 brightest NVSS  
were measured to be located within 10% of the synthesized beamwidth  
and 100 mJy of the NVSS flux densities. The limits reported herein  
are consistent with the tentative WSRT detection at 4.9 GHz (Horst et  
al. GCNs 6549, 6576).

A 42-antenna ATA is currently being commissioned."
