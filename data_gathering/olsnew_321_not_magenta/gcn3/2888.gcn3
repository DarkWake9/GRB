We observed INTEGRAL GRB 041218 localization by Mereghetti et al. (GCN 
2858) using 1.04m telescope at ARIES NainiTal, starting from Dec 19.66 
UT. Several R_c band frames were observed in thin cloudy conditions. 
In a 300sec x 5 averaged frame, we put an upper limit of ~ 21 mag around 
1.0 day after the burst at the OT position by Torii K. (GCN 2860), in 
comparison to the nearby stars using the field photometry by Henden 
(GCN 2869).
