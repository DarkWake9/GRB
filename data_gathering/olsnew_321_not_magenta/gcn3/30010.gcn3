The AMON,  IceCube, and HAWC collaborations report:

The AMON NuEm stream channel found two coincidence alerts from the
IceCube online neutrino selection + HAWC daily monitoring analysis.
The analysis looks for IceCube neutrino events -mostly atmospheric
in origin- around the position and transit time of a HAWC cluster of
likely gamma rays, as identified in the integrated observations from
a single transit, in this case having a duration of ~6 hours.

NuEM-210515A
The HAWC transit interval starts  from 05-14-2021 18:06:02 UT to
05-15-2021 00:20:43 UT
(End of the HAWC transit time)

The location of the coincidence is reported as
RA (J2000): 93.64deg
Dec (J2000): 14.66 deg
Location uncertainty (50% containment): 0.15 deg (statistical only).
Location uncertainty (90% containment): 0.27 deg (statistical only).

The false alarm rate (FAR) of this coincidence is 3.93 per year.

NuEM-210515B
The HAWC transit interval starts  from 05-14-2021 18:09:25 UT to
05-15-2021 00:19:27 UT
(End of the HAWC transit time)

The location of the coincidence is reported as
RA (J2000): 93.93deg
Dec (J2000): 12.51deg
Location uncertainty (50% containment): 0.20 deg (statistical only).
Location uncertainty (90% containment): 0.36 deg (statistical only).

The false alarm rate (FAR) of this coincidence is 1.90 per year.

We encourage follow-up observations of the alert region contingent on
availability of resources and interest, given the quoted FAR.

AMON seeks to perform a real-time correlation analysis of the
high-energy signals across all known astronomical messengers. More
