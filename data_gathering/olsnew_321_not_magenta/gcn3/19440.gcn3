S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:
 
Using the full data set from T-239 to T+303 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report that trigger #686845 was due to a noise fluctuation in the image domain
that was located close to a known source (XTE J2123-058).  Ground analysis shows
the significance has dropped to 2.5 sigma.
