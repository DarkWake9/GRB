D.N. Burrows (PSU), T.G.R. Roegiers (PSU), L.M. McCauley (PSU), B.
Mingo (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), A. Melandri
(INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC) and B. Mingo (U
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 161104A (Mingo et al. GCN
Circ. 20123), from 68 s to 23.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for
this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 20124).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.37 (+0.17, -0.16).

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.37, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.6 x 10^-3 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
