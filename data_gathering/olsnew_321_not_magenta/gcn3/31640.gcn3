The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:15:16 UT on 23 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220223A (trigger 667275321.995302 / 220223094).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 26.2, Dec = -20.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 44m, -20d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 52.0 degrees.
