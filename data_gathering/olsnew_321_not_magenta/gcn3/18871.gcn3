The long-duration GRB 160113A has been detected by Fermi (GBM: Roberts 
and Burns, GCN Circ. 18861), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Swift 
(BAT), and Mars-Odyssey (HEND), so far, at about 34350 s UT (09:32:30). 
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Corners:
    197.219 (13h 08m 52s) +18.468 (+18d 28' 03")
    197.479 (13h 09m 55s) +19.448 (+19d 26' 51")
    177.907 (11h 51m 38s) -19.867 (-19d 52' 02")
    178.597 (11h 54m 23s) -19.094 (-19d 05' 38")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 17.0 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 42.8 deg (the minimum one is 45 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 100 deg.

This box may be improved.

The intersection of the box with the 3 sigma contours of the GBM ground 
position was outside of the BAT coded FoV.

There is only one OT candidate, iPTF15fln (Singer et al., GCN Circ. 
18859), consistent with the box; the candidate was marked as possibly 
fading. The distance between the narrowest annulus (Konus-HEND annulus 
with 3 sigma half width of 0.375 deg) center line and the iPTF15fln is 
5.2 arcmin, supporting the association of the transient and the GRB.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
