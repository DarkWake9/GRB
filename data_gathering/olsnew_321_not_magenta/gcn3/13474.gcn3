C. Bathurst (U. South Florida), D. A. Frail (NRAO) and S. B. Cenko (UC
Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of the potential X-ray afterglow (GCN 13400,
13394) of the Fermi GBM (GCN 13377) and LAT (GCN 13379) GRB 120624B with
the VLA. In observations taken on 2012 July 10.00 UT, at center
frequencies of 5 GHz and 14 GHz, we find an unresolved radio source
coincident with the position of the claimed X-ray afterglow (GCN 13400).
The radio source is detected at 5-6 sigma significance and it has a
rising spectrum consistent with the extrapolation of the 3mm PdBI
detection (GCN 14321). Further 5 GHz observations were also made on June
26, June 29 and July 11. The 5 GHz flux density of the radio source shows
no evidence for variability through these 4 epochs.

Further observations are planned.
