"At 09:43:10.98 UT on 12 July 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210712A (trigger 647775795 / 210712405),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Sbarufatti et al. 2021, GCN 30447).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 36 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of an emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 8 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.3 s to T0+6.6 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.04 +/- 0.13 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 230 +/- 50 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.51 +/- 0.17)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
