DATE:    17/03/30 23:13:06 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 170330A, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 283.3308, -13.4310
which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 18 53 19.39
   Dec (J2000) = -13 25 51.7
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence).
Analysis of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/744773.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
