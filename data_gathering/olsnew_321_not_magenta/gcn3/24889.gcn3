M. H. Siegel (PSU) and E. Sonbas (Adiyaman Univ.)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 190627A
115 s after the BAT trigger (Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 24888).
An uncatalogued source consistent with the BAT position
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.

The preliminary UVOT position is:
   RA  (J2000) =  16:19:18.69 = 244.82788 (deg.)
   Dec (J2000) = -05:17:20.8  =  -5.28912 (deg.)
with an estimated uncertainty of 0.46 arc sec. (radius, 90% confidence).

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are: 

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)           Mag

white              115          144           29         18.15 +/- 0.10

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.18 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
