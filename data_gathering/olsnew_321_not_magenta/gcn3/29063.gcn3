The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:07:25 UT on 16 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201216C (trigger 629852850.753568 / 201216963).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 17.9, Dec = 16.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 11m, 16d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 93.0 degrees.
