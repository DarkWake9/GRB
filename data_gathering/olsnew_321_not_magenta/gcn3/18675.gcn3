S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:08:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located 4U 1850-03 (trigger=666827).  Swift did not slew due to observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 282.088, -2.421, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 48m 21s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 25' 16"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, nothing is visible
in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 10:55 UT on 2016 February 15. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time.
