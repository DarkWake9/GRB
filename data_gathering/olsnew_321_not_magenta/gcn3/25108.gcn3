Igor Andreoni (Caltech) reports on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations


We searched for Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detections associated with MASTER OT J203053.79+384020.1 / AT2019lly (Lipunov et al., GCN #25105) in the archive of ZTF alerts.  A point source (g=19.85 +- 0.03) is present in the ZTF reference image at the location of AT2019lly and an outburst was detected on 2019-07-15 08:00:18 UT at magnitude g=14.240 +- 0.027.

The ZTF detection occurred 3 days before the gravitational wave candidate S190718y (LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, GCN #25087, GCN #25107), excluding an association between MASTER OT J203053.79+384020.1 / AT2019lly and S190718y.  Our conclusion is in agreement with the Cataclysmic Variable scenario suggested by Lipunov et al. (GCN #25105).
