The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:51:55.92 UT on 20 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220120A (trigger 664383120 / 220120619).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 249.7, Dec = -45.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 38m, -45d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
