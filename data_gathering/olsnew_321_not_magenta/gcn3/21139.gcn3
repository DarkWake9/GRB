A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo
(INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), B. Sbarufatti
(INAF-OAB/PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), A. Cholden-Brown (PSU), S.L. Gibson
(U. Leicester) and J.G. Gropp report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 170524A (Gropp et al. GCN
Circ. 21135), from 69 s to 46.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for
this burst was given by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 21136). There is
evidence that the source may be fading, however we cannot constrain the
decay at the current time

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00754322.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
