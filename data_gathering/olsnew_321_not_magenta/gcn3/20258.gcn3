D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), J. Telting 
(NOT), E. Gafton, report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the INTEGRAL GRB 161214A (Mereghetti et al., 
GCN 20251) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the 
AlFOSC imaging camera. Observations were carried out at the very end of 
the night, starting about 40 min after the morning twilight, and only a 
single 200 s exposure taken with the SDSS r filter was useful.

The optical afterglow (Guidorzi et al., GCN 20252; Klotz et al., GCN 
20254; Kruehler & Greiner, GCN 20255) is faintly detected in our images. 
By comparison with nearby SDSS stars, we measure for the afterglow r = 
20.9 +- 0.3 (AB) at a mean epoch 2016 Dec 14.303, that is 2.50 hr after 
the GRB.
