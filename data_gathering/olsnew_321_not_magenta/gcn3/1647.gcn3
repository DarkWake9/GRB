 D. A. Frail (NRAO), and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We have used the VLA to observe the IPN error box (GCN 1629) for the
gamma-ray burst GRB 021008 on 2002 Oct. 17.7 and Oct. 19.8 UT at a
frequency of 4.86 GHz and 8.46 GHz. At 4.86 GHz the entire error box
was imaged, while at 8.46 only the inner half was imaged. There are no
radio sources in this area at either frequency at or above a level of
175 uJy (5-sigma).

No further observations are planned."
