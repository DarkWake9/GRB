A.Volnova (SAI MSU/IKI), R. Burenin(IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed We imaged the location of the Swift (Cummings et al., GCN 
14257), Fermi (Guiriec et al., GCN 14260; Yu et al., GCN 14261), and 
Konus (Golenetskii et al., GCN 14262) GRB 130305A with AZT-33IK 
telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) on March 05 between (UT) 20:44:08 
- 22:17:04. We took several images in R-filter of 100 s exposure under 
unfavorable seeing (FWHM) of about 4.2 arcsec.  We do not detect any 
sources within the XRT error circle (Malesani
et al., GCN 14263). A photometry of a combined image is following

UT start,  t-t0       Filter Exp.   OT    UL (3 sigma)
           (mid, days)        (s)

20:44:08  0.41071     R      35x100 n/d   21.4

The photometry is based on  SDSS DR8  star
SDSS J074702.42+520103.3 07:47:02.43 +52:01:03.4 R = 16.94
