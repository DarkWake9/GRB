M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL) on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team reports:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White
filter starting 3080 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible
candidates have been identified in the initial data products. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers about
86% of the BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete
to about 18 mag.

The GRB occurred in a crowded field only 5.8 deg from the Galactic Plane.

No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.49.
