Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070612A (trigger #282066)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 6509).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 121.355, 37.258 deg  which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  8h  5m 25.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = 37d 15' 30" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 11%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two main overlapping peaks
with the first starting at ~T-20 sec and the second ending at ~T+400 sec.
The two peaks are at T+5 and T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 370 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.7 to T+418 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.69 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+10.39 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
