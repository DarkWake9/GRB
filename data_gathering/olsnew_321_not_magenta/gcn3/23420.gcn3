Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181110A (trigger #871316)
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 23413).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 302.330, -36.878 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  20h 09m 19.2s
  Dec(J2000) = -36d 52' 41.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-110 s and ends at ~T+130 s. The main peak occurs at ~T+25 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 138.4 +- 10.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-109.3 to T+129.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.02 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.9 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+25.03 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
