TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4045
SUBJECT: GRB 050820A: NIR photometry at the TNG
DATE:    05/09/28 17:08:00 GMT
FROM:    Stefano Covino at Brera Astronomical Observatory  <covino@merate.mi.astro.it>

F. Mannucci, S. Covino, D. Malesani, on behalf of the CIBO collaboration
report:


We observed the field of GRB 050820A (Page et al., GCN 3830) in the NIR
at the TNG equipped with NICS on the 21st of August at 05:00 UT, about
22.4 hours after the high-energy event. The OT identified by Fox et al.
(GCN 3829) is clearly visible with J magnitude:

J = 18.48 +/- 0.08

Calibration has been derived by comparison with a suitable number of
2MASS stars in the field.
