Using the data set from T-160 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130306A (trigger #550457)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 14266).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 279.475, -11.682 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 37m 54.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 40' 55.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 11%.
 
This burst was already active when it came into the BAT FoV during a slew
at T-160 sec.  There were several peaks until ~T-130 sec, then a long
relatively smooth decay out past T+900 sec (when the data ends).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-159.5 to T+154.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.95 +- 0.05.  The 1-sec peak photon flux (during the period of BAT viewing)
measured from T-152.73 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 7.3 +- 0.8 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
