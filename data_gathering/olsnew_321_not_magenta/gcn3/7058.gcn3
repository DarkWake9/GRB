At 18:23:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071112B (trigger=296503).  Swift did not slew because
of the Earth observing constraint.  Swift will slew at T+33 min. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 260.305, -80.884 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 21m 13s
   Dec(J2000) = -80d 53' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a double spike
structure with a duration of about 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data 
products to analyze. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Perri (perri AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
