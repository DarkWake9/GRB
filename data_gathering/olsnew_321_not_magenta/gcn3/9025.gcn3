report on behalf of the Fermi GBM team:

"The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has triggered on two bursts from
SGR J1550-5418 on March 22. The first occurred at 18:56:23.75 (trigger
259440985 / 090322789) and the second at 22:39:15.75 UT (trigger 259454357
/ 090322944). The latter burst was very bright, and also detected by
SuperAGILE (GCN 9014). Both bursts were independently detected by INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS.

These are the first GBM triggers after the second active period of SGR
J1550-5418 that ended on February 24, 2009. A complete list of the GBM
triggers from this SGR can be found at:
