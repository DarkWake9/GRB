P. D'Avanzo, M.G. Bernardini, A. Melandri (INAF/OAB), P.A. Evans and
M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:


Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued and
fading X-ray source. Using 40 s of XRT Photon Counting mode
data and 1 UVOT image, we find an astrometrically corrected
X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching
UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec =40.66674, -0.38488 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  02 42 40.02
Dec (J2000): -00 23 05.6

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
