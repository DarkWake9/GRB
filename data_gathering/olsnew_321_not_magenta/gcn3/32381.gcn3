T. Komesh (NU), B. Grossan (UCB, NU), Z. Maksut (NU), M. Krugov (FAI), 
report on behalf of the Energetic Cosmos Laboratory: The Nazarbayev 
University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory 
(NUTTelA-TAO) observed the field of GRB 220711B on receipt of an 
automated GCN / BAT position alert, observing in Sloan g', r' and i' 
bands, with the Burst Simultaneous Three-Channel Imager (BSTI; Grossan, 
Kumar & Smoot 2019, JHEA, 32, 14). We received the alert at UT 
2022-07-11 18:16:50, 22 seconds after  the BAT trigger time, and started 
observations at UT 18:17:02, 12 s after receipt, 34 s after the BAT 
trigger. Observations were made under partially cloudy conditions. No 
new or changing sources consistent with the XRT position (Beardmore 
2022, GCN 32370) were detected. The observations fully cover the 
UVOT/XRT observation time interval and partly cover the prompt emission 
time (D'Ai 2022, GCN 32366). Note that these observations provide 
essentially full-time coverage, simultaneous in all three bands. We 
report the following results: start time t-t0(s) end time UL g' UL r' 
ULi' exposure_time (s) ------------ -------- ----------- ------ ------ 
----- ------ 18:17:02 34 18:18:02 18.3 18.1 17.7 60 18:18:17 109 
18:23:17 19.2 18.9 18.7 300 start time is in UT. t-t0(s) gives the time 
since trigger, in seconds. UL gives the 5 sigma upper limit sensitivity 
in magnitudes, for images co-added to the given exposure time. The first 
row in the table corresponds to co-adds of an initial short exposure 
image sequence of 0.3 s (these sub-second exposures are read-noise 
suppressed by our EMCCD cameras, with high gain electron multiplication 
active; other images are taken in conventional CCD operation mode) for 
g' and r', and 7.5 s for i'. The second row corresponds to co-adds from 
a continuing series of 3 s exposures for g' and r', and 15 s exposures 
for i'.  Calibration was done with 4 bright Pan-STARRS catalog stars on 
our images. We caution the reader that these are preliminary results, 
without color or other corrections. Please also note that times are 
approximate. ---------------------------------- NU = Nazarbayev
