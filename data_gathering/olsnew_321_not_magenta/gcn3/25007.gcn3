In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190706ai at T0 = 2019-07-06 22:26:41.345 (UT)
(GCN #24998), we performed an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID)
data.

At the LIGO/Virgo trigger time (T0), the GRID exposure covered nearly 54% of the
90% c.l. localization region (LR), observed at off-axis angles between 30 and 50 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed between
different time intervals and time integrations near T0. Preliminary values of 3-sigma
upper limits (UL) obtained within the accessible LIGO/Virgo 90% c.l. LR are:

(T0-2s; T0+2s): from 9.4e-07 to 2.4e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

(T0; T0+10s): from 3.4e-07 to 8.9e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

(T0; T0+100s): from 3.6e-08 to 2.7e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
