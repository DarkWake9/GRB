University),  D. Nanni (INAF/OAR and Second University of Roma "Tor
Vergata"), I. Bruni and S. Galleti (Bologna Observatory), and G.
Pizzichini (INAF/IASF Bologna) report:

We have imagined the field of GRB 060526  by means of the 152 cm
telescope of Loiano equipped with Bfosc obtaining 6 frames in Rc,
3 in V and 3 in I.
Preliminary photometry, using USNO B1 (R1) stars, on May 27.0024
(UT mean time) yields Rc = 19.34 +- 0.10.
The Rc image has been posted in our public directory from where it
