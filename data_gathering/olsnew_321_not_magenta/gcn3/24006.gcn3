The long GRB 190324A (Swift-BAT trigger #894718: LaPorte et al.,
GCN Circ. 23993; Fermi GBM detection: Hui, GCN Circ. 24002)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:44:16.902 UTC
on 24 March 2019. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked pulse which starts
at T=2.7 sec, peaks at 5.1 sec and ends at T+20.5 sec.
The precursor is not seen in the CGBM data.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
12.6 +- 2.3 sec and 4.5 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
