on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

On February 16.078935 UT we observed again the field of the suspect 
J-band counterpart of GRB 010214 (Di Paola et al., GCN #939)
for a total exposure time of 7200 sec, with the AZT-24 1.1-meter 
telescope at Campo Imperatore (AQ), Italy.

The point-like source reported in GCN #939 was still detected 
with a S/N=20 and a magnitude of J=19.1+/-0.1 consistent with the 
previous measurement. 

The source could be a very red foreground object but at this time, 
due to the few existent IR measures of GRBs afterglow, an anomalous 
IR afterglow cannot be excluded. Further IR observations are needed.
