Using the data set from T-239 to T+380 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141026A (trigger #616502)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 16950).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 44.049, 26.925 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 56m 11.8s 
  Dec(J2000) = +26d 55' 31.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 88%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak episode starting at ~T+15 sec, 
and ending around ~T+180 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 146 +- 13 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).  Note since this GRB went outside the FOV of 
BAT around ~T+250 sec, this duration measurement might be affected if there 
were significant emission from the source after ~T+250 sec.  

The time-averaged spectrum from T+13.96 to T+177.75 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.34 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+65.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
