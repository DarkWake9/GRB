on behalf of the HETE FREGATE Team;

After extensive ground analysis of the WXM data for GRB030913 (=H2849),
we have succeeded in localizing this burst.  The WXM localization based
on ground analysis can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is
12 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

  WXM-Ground:   RA = +20h 58m 07.4s, Dec = -02d 21' 54" (J2000).

GRB030913 was too faint to be localized by the SXC.

The WXM ground localization confirms the flight localization reported 
in a GCN Position Notice on 2003 13 Sep at 17:07:35 UT, 37 sec after 
the burst and in GCN Circular 2383.

Therefore, if you observed the flight localization of GRB030913, we
strongly encourage you to examine your observations for the optical
afterglow or to set limits on the brightness of any optical afterglow.
