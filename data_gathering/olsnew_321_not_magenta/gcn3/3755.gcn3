    MASTER (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB 050801 (Swift 
trigger 148833, GCN 3752). The first image  was at 198 sec after  SWIFT 
GRB050803 detection  (19:14:00.34 UT)   under the bad weather
conditions on the evening sky near the horizont (GCN3750). We have the 
first low resolution spectra (50A) image of the error box by 200 mm
camera  up to 9m.
     The first  unfiltred image  on 355 mm camera  was made at 28 min 
(19h32m25s UT) after GRB  time due to technical problems (the limit is 
14.6 m).
The magnitude close to R.
