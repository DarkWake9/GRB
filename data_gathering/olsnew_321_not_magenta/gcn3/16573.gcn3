Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140710 (trigger #603954)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 16563).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 41.088, 35.499 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  02h 44m 21.0s
    Dec(J2000) = +35d 29' 54.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 58%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak of duration ~4 seconds,
starting at T0. T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.52 +- 0.91 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.23 to T+3.80 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.00 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV 
band is 1.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
