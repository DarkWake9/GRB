P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii), S.B. Cenko (Caltech) and D.B. Fox (Penn State)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the XRT localisation of GRB 060510b (GCN #5096) with
the Gemini North telescope + NIRI.  Our observations consisted of 18 x
60 sec integrations commencing 2006 May 10.415 UTC.  We detect the
optical afterglow candidate of Mirabal & Halpern (GCN #5098), and
estimate that the source is J ~ 19 mag (based on comparison with 2MASS
star at 239.121115,+78.575104 with J = 16.6 mag).

We have triggered optical spectroscopy observations with Gemini North.
