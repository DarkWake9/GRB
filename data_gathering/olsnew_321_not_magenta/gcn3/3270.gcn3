W. Li, R. Chornock, S. Jha, and A. V. Filippenko (University of 
California, Berkeley) report:

"The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory
robotically observed Swift GRB 050416 (Trigger #114753; Sakamoto et
al., GCN 3264). The first 3x15s R-band grid image started at 11:05:25 
UT (40.5s after the burst), which did not detect the afterglow as
observed by Cenko and Fox (GCN 3265) to a limiting magnitude of about
16.5 when compared to the USNO A2.0 catalog. Our subsequent images
have varying exposure times from 15s to 360s, and were observed with
R, I, V, and z filters. Due to the depth of the images, only a 60s
I-band image started 11:12:09 UT (444.5s after the burst) has a
marginal detection of the afterglow. Further analysis is in progress."
