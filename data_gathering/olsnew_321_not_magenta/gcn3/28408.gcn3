Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200909B (trigger #995288)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 28406).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 175.171, -31.199 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  11h 40m 41.1s
    Dec(J2000) = -31d 11' 54.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 35%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak that stars at T-6 sec,
peaks at T+1 sec, and ends at T+20 sec.  A hint of an extended emission
is visible until T+40 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 16.9 +- 2.2 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.6 to T+14.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.60 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
