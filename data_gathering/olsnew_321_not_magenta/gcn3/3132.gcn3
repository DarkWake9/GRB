A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed again the
field of GRB050319 (GCN 3117) on 2005 Mar 21.4 UT.
We still do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical
afterglow (GCN 3116).  We place a (2-sigma) limit of 133 uJy at
that position.  Combining these data with those of our previous
epoch (GCN 3127), we derive a deeper limit of 70 uJy (2-sigma rms)
for the field."
