SUBJECT: GRB 151112A: Swift-XRT observations

D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), M. Perri (ASDC), G. Tagliaferri
(INAF-OAB), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 151112A at 14:37:09.1 UT,
3141.0 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 2.05651, -61.66273
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 08m 13.56s
   Dec(J2000) = -61d 39' 45.8"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 107 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.92 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3
(+2.37/-2.09) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
