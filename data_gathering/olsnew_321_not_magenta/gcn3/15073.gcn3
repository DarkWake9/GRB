K. Varela (MPE Garching), M. Tanga (MPE Garching), P. Afonso (American
River College) and J. Greiner (MPE Garching) report on behalf of the
GROND team:

We observed a second epoch of the field of GRB 130803A (Swift trigger
565263; Page et al., GCN 15059) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHKs with GROND
(Greiner et al.2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope
at La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 23:34 UT on August 5, about 61.7 hours after
the trigger at a mean seeing of 1.5 arcsec and a mean airmass of 1.3. We
confirm the detection of the source inside the enhanced 1.4'' XRT error
circle (Swift webpage) reported in a previous GCN (Varela et al.,
GCN15066),
and measure consistent magnitudes as compared to the first epoch
(the g'-band magnitude contained an error and should read g' = 24.6 +/- 0.4).
Thus, we consider this source as the potential host of GRB 130803A.
