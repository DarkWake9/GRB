Using the data set from T-239 to T+381 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080810 (trigger #319584)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 8080).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 356.783, 0.310 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 47m 08.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +00d 18' 35.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 68%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a cluster of overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-20, the tallest at T+25 sec, and ending at ~T+120 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 106 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-21.2 to T+111.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+24.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
