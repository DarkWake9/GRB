"At 07:20:08.70 UT on 27 February 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200227A (trigger 604480813 / 200227306),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Laha et al. 2020, GCN 27234).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 19 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single broad peak
with a duration (T90) of about 24 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+24 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 139 +/- 10 keV, alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.05,
and beta = -2.28 +/- 0.11.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.41  +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.8 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
