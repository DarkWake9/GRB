Using the data set from T-239 to T+843 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080727C (trigger #318170)
(Parsons, et al., GCN Circ. 8035).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 32.638, 64.130 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 10m 33.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 07' 48.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-5 sec and ending at ~T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 79.7 +- 8.8 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.3 to T+116.3 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.87 +- 0.20, 
and Epeak of 143.2 +- 50.0 keV (chi squared 66 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+15.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
2.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.30 +- 0.05 (chi squared 81 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
