TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  229
SUBJECT: GRB990123: NIR Observation

L.A. Antonelli, A. Di Paola, Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma, 
G. Gandolfi (BeppoSAX Scientific Operation Center) report on 
behalf of SWIRT Team and BeppoSAX Team:

"On 25.16 (UT) January 1999, we imaged the Optical Transient field 
in the K band using the 1.1m AZT-24 telescope and the near-infrared 
camera/spectrometer SWIRCAM at the Campo Imperatore Astronomical 
Observatory (http://www.mporzio.astro.it/cimperatore/WWW/) operated 
by the Astronomical Observatory of Rome (O.A.R.). 

The 4'X4' field of view was exposed for 3300 s reaching the limiting
magnitude in the K band of 17.9 +/- 0.2 mag. No source has been found
within the errorbox of the O.T. (IAUC 7094). This observation provides
a more compelling upper limit in K band with respect to the previous
observation in the same band (GCN #214). The behaviour of the 
source between the two observation, at this wavelenght, is unknown. 

Further near infrared observations are in progress.
