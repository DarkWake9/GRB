on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We observed the field of the GRB081203A (A. M. Parsons et al., GCN #8595) 
in the Rc-band with the 6-m telescope of the SAO RAS in Caucasus. In total 15
3-min exposures were obtained starting from 01:42 7 Dec. 2008 UT (T-T_0 =
3.49 days).  We clearly detected an object at the position of the UVOT
optical transient (M. De Pasquale and A. Parsons, GCN #8603).
Calibration based on the SDSS stars yields the brightness of the OT as
R = 23.94 +/- 0.13 (errors are statistical only). At the 3.2 +/- 0.2 
arcsec to the South-West from the OT position we also detect an extended
object with R = 22.74 +/- 0.07. For redshift of z=2.05 (N.P.M Kuin et al,
astro-ph/0812.2943) it corresponds to ~26 kpc in projection (H0=71,
Omega_M=0.3, Omega_L=0.7). It is unlikely that this object is a host 
galaxy of the GRB081203A but redshift measurements are needed for certainty. 
Further observations are planned.
