Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI) and Vania Lorenzi (INAF/TNG) report on 
behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 141031B (Gompertz et al., GCN 16998) with 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with StanCam. Observations 
were carried out in the Johnson R (9x300 s) and SDSS z (6x300 s) filters 
under moderate weather conditions (1.5" seeing).

No objects are detected in either bands within the refined X-ray 
position (Goad et al., GCN 17009), down to limiting magnitudes of R = 
22.5 (Vega) and z = 21.5 (AB), with mean times 7.93 and 8.48 hr after 
the GRB (calibration against USNO B1 and SDSS, respectively).
