and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171124A (Longo et al., GCN circ. 22156; Bissaldi et al.,
GCN circ. 22164; Sharma et al., GCN circ. 22168; Li et al., GCN circ. 22171) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 05:37:55.34 on 24 November 2017.
The burst signal was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows several peaks.  The emission starts
at T0, peaks at T+9 sec and ends at T+21 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 17.8 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
