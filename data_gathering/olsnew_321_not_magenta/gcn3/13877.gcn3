A. A. Volnova (SAI MSU, IKI RAS), A. S. Moskvitin (SAO RAS) on behalf
of larger collaboration, reports

We observed the field of GRB 121017A (Grupe et al., GCN Circ. 13875)
with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 telescope of SAO RAS
in Rc band. The weather conditions were good, airmass = 5 - 6, seeing
= 2.6". Observations were started since 9.5 minutes
after the BAT trigger, middle time t-t0 = 0.01407 days.

We do not detect any object in the XRT error circle down to a limiting
magnitude 18.8 as well as Jelínek et al. (GCN Circ. 13876).
