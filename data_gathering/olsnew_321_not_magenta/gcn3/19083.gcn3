D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), N. Tanvir (U. of Leicester), 
A. Kvammen (NOT) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160225A (Siegel et al. GCN 19075) using the 
2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. 
Observations started at 23:31:27 UT on 2016-02-25 (i.e., 8.56 hr 
post-burst) and 9x200s exposures were obtained in the Sloan r- and 
i-band, respectively.

The optical afterglow is detected at the WHT position (Wiersema et al., 
GCN 19082) and presumably also the MITSuME position (Yoshii et al. GCN 
19080). We measured m(r)=23.25 +/- 0.15 at 8.86 hr post-burst and m(i) = 
22.55 +/- 0.07 at 9.48 hr post-burst, calibrated with nearby SDSS stars.
