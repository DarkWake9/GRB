The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 19:14:28 UT on 21 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191221A (trigger 598648473.844298 / 191221802).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 40.8, Dec = -43.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 43m, -43d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 21.0 degrees.
