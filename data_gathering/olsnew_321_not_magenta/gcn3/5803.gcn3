P. Roming (PSU), F. Marshall (GSFC), M. Chester (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 131 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 3046 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag.
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.04.
