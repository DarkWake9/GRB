C. Perez del Pulgar and A. Castellon (Univ. de Malaga), E. 
Fernandez-Garcia, Y. Hu, I. Carrasco
and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, 
report:

The 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) 
in Algarrobo Costa (Spain) automatically
responded in 53s (and 132s after the GRB onset) to the Swift trigger of 
GRB 180720C (LaPorte et al., GCNC 22982).
The first image (10s exposure, unfiltered) was obtained at 22:26:09 UT. 
At the position of the Swift X-ray
afterglow (Evans et al. GCNC 22987), no optical afterglow is detected 
down 18 mag in this crowded field in
the direction of the Galactic Center (i.e. high extinction towards the 
source is very likely present).
This is consistent with the limits reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCNC 
22991), Oates et al. (GCNC 22992) and
Gorbovskoy et al. (GCNC 23009).
