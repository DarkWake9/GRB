The Global MASTER network continues to inspect error box of the short
bright gamma-ray burst GRB 181222B (Veres, GCN #23551; Lipunov et al.,
GCN #23552)

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy,
vol. 2010, 30L) located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory)
started inspect survey of  Fermi GRB18122B   IPN
error-box (Svinkin et al., GCN #23556)
36801 sec after notice time and 36801 sec after trigger time
at 2018-12-24 19:07:42 UT.
  There are 479 galaxies in IPN localization.

MASTER auto-detection system found optical transient:

MASTER OT J204928.79+245744.0 detection.

MASTER-IAC auto-detection system discovered OT source at
(RA, Dec)=20h 49m 28.79s +24d 57m 44.0s on 2018-12-24.81773 UT.
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 16.9m (limit 18.6m).

The OT is seen in 2 images. There is no minor planet at this place.
We have reference image without OT on 2018-08-02.04970 UT with 18.7m unfiltered magnitude limit .
There is red start in PanSTARR (rmag=21.7) and SDSS.9 (r=21.9)
Spectral observations are required.


Observations started at twilight.The sun  altitude was -11.5 deg.
The observations made on zenit distance = 29 deg.
The moon (94 % bright part) below the horizon
The altitude of the Moon is -14 deg.
The object can be observed till 2018-12-25 00:54:38.
The galactic latitude b = -60 deg., longitude l = 98 deg.

MASTER-Amur robotic telescope  located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State
Pedagogical University) was pointed to the  FERMI GRB181222B 46503 sec
after trigger time at 2018-12-23 09:06:40 UT, with upper limit up to  17.8
mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenit
distance = 44 deg. The sun  altitude  is -14.2 deg.

MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope  located in Russia (Applied Physics
Institute, Irkutsk State University) was pointed to the  FERMI
GRB181222B 52255 sec after trigger time at 2018-12-23 10:42:32 UT, with
upper limit up to  18.6 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The
observations began at zenit distance = 44 deg. The sun  altitude  is -14.5
deg.
