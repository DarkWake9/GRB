K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Mars Odyssey GRB
teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin, on
behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, HEND, and GRS observed this burst at around 13622 +/- 907 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~100 s, a 25-100 keV
fluence ~6.7E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of ~9x10^-7 erg/cm2 s.  
We have localized it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl=351.792,
-65.129 degrees, whose radius is 52.578 +/- 0.1 degrees.

All the above numbers are based on a very preliminary analysis; in
particular, since the burst has only been localized to an annulus, the
Earth-crossing time cannot be given to better precision.  It is
possible that one of the near-Earth spacecraft in the IPN detected it,
so it should eventually be possible to obtain a more precise position
and Earth-crossing time.
