The long-duration GRB 171112A
(MAXI/GSC detection: Sugita et al., GCN Circ. 22118)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=75019.162 s UT (20:50:19.162).

The burst light curve shows multipeaked structure
which starts at ~T0-204 s and has a total duration of ~310 s.
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB171112_T75019/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.80(-0.33,+0.47)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.720 s,
of 2.43(-0.97,+1.17)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is best fit in the 30 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.51(-0.30,+0.38),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.67(-1.20,+0.44),
the peak energy Ep = 200(-30,+34) keV
(chi2 = 91/82 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
