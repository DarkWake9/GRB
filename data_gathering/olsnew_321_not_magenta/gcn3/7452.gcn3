report on behalf of the TORTOREM team:

TORTORA wide-field optical camera (12 cm diameter, 20x25 deg FOV, TV-CCD,
unfiltered) mounted on REM robotic 60-cm telescope located at La Silla
(Chile) observed the field of GRB 080319B (GCN 7427, Racusin et al.)
before, during and after the gamma-emission with 0.13 s time resolution.

We observe optical emission at the position given by Swift XRT:

1. We did not detect any transient  brighter than 8.5m (unfiltered,
near B) at T-100 - T+16 s 

2. We detect rapidly rising OT (~5 second rise front) and observe it
between T+16 and T+30, the peak brightness has been around 5 m

3. Between T+30 and T+36 the observations have been paused due to
repointing of REM telescope

4. Since T+36 we continuously observe the transient until it faded below
the detection limit (~8.5m) at T+90 s

The detailed analysis is in progress.
