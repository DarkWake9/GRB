The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:56:38 UT on 10 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220210A (trigger 666230203.371058 / 220210998).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 7.9, Dec = 61.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 31m, 61d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.0 degrees.
