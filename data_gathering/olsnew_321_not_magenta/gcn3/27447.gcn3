The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:24:47 UT on 26 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200326A (trigger 606918292.90322 / 200326517).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 245.3, Dec = -21.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 21m, -21d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 89.0 degrees.
