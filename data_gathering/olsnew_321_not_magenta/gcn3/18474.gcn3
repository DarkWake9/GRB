Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We analyzed the VLA image of the field of iPTF15cyk (Singer et al. GCN
18330, Palliyaguru et al. GCN 18420), located in the error region of
LIGO/Virgo G184098. A provisional reduction shows no radio emission above
the 3-sigma level of 45 uJy (the map rms is ~15 uJy at 5 GHz) at the iPTF
position of the transient.
