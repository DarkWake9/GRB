We have observed a 20 x 20 deg field-of-view centered on the  LIGO/Virgo G298048 localization region  (LVC GCN #21513) with the Murchison Widefield Array.  We observed 2017-08-18 07:07 UT to 2017-08-18 09:35 UT at a central frequency of 185 MHz and with a bandwidth of 30 MHz.  No emission was detected at the position of NGC 4993.  The RMS noise was 17 mJy/beam (note that the array is in the process of being reconfigured, so only 5/16 of the tiles are operational).   Analysis of subsequent epochs with the reconfigured array is underway.

We thank the MWA Operations team for supporting these observations.
