[GCN OPS NOTE:  Due to a processing problem at the GCN end, this circular
was delayed in distribution (as were others, which see).  It was received
at 00:34:58 UT 05 Jul 99.  It was received before GCN#362.
Also, please note that the problem seems to be due to a problem
with the gcncirc@lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov account.  Until I can resolve
this problem with the System Administrators during tomorrow's normal business
hours (today is a National holiday), please send any future notices
to the gcncirc@lheawww account AND
to the gcncirc@gris1.gsfc.nasa.gov, i.e. the account name is the same
but a second host machine has been added.  The second account@host is
also working.]
