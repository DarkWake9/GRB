Xin, J.Y. Wei, G.W. Li (NAOC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 220408A detected by Swift (Caputo et al., 
GCN 31848) and Fermi (Fermi GBM team, GCN 31847) using the 
Xinglong-2.16m telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera. Observations 
were carried out starting at 12:02:32 UT on 2022-04-08 (i.e., 6.27 hr 
since the BAT trigger), and 9x400 s frames in the R-band were obtained.

The previously reported optical counterpart (e.g., Caputo et al., GCN 
31848; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 31850) is not detected in our stacked 
image, down to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 20.7 (Vega) at 6.79 hr 
post-burst, calibrated with the nearby SDSS field.
