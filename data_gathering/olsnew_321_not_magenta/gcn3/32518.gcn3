The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:28:43 UT on 5 Sep 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220905A (trigger 684070128.696976 / 220905478).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 343.5, Dec = -33.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 53m, -33d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
