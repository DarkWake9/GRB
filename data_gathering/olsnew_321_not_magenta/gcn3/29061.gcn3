D. M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 23:07:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201216C (trigger=1013243).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 16.358, +16.537 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 05m 26s
   Dec(J2000) = +16d 32' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~13000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~20 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+46.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. P. Beardmore (apb AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
