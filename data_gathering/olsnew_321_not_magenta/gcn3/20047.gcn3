We observed the field of GRB 161014A detected by Swift
(Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 20035) with the 12-inch AGU Robotic
Optical Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N)
located at the Sagamihara campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.

20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting
from October 14 12:47:48 (UT) about 1200 seconds after the trigger
and stopped on October 14 13:13:14 (UT).  We do not detect the optical
afterglow (Morita et al., GCN Circ. 20036; Guidorzi et al., GCN Circ. 20037;
Xin et al., GCN Circ. 20038; Nakaoka et al., GCN Circ. 20039;
D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ. 20040; Mazaeva et al., GCN Circ. 20042;
de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN CIrc. 20043) both in the individual
images and the stacked image.  The estimated five sigma upper limit
of the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec) is ~15.9 mag
using the USNO-B1 catalog.
