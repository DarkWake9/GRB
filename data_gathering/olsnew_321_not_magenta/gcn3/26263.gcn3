SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S191120aj: Retraction of GW compact binary merger candidate

FROM:    Leo Singer at GSFC  <leo.p.singer@nasa.gov>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S191120aj is no longer considered to be a gravitational wave
signal. The signal is attributed to periodic glitches in L1 caused by
ground motion due to forestry activities near the site. The signal in H1
is not significant by itself.
