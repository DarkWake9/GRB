The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:54:18 UT on 30 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200830A (trigger 620474063.489866 / 200830413).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.8, Dec = 56.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 59m, 56d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 56.0 degrees.
