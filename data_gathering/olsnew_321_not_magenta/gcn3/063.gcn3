GRB 980425: Radio Observations

M. Wieringa (ATNF), D.A. Frail (NRAO), S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech),
J.L. Higdon (ATNF), R. Wark (ATNF), and the BeppoSAX GRB Team report:

Radio observations were made with the Australian Telescope Compact
Array beginning on April 28.73 and April 28.98 UT at 6cm and 3cm,
centered on the position of 1SAXJ1935.0-5248, an X-ray source detected
by the NFI on BeppoSAX (Pian et al. 1998; GCN #61). In addition, radio
observations of the transient BeppoSAX NFI source 1SAXJ1935.3-5252
were made (also at 6cm and 3cm) on April 29.79 and April 30.00 UT

No radio sources were detected in the 1' error radius of the two NFI
sources. Typical three-sigma limits were 0.26 mJy and 0.3 mJy at 3cm
and 6cm, respectively.

Three radio sources are detected in the 8' error radius of the
BeppoSAX WFC. There is one object just outside the error circle of
1SAXJ1935.0-5248 at RA 19:34:56.49, Dec -52:49:04.9 (J2000) with a
flux density of 2.4 mJy at 6cm and 1.1 mJy at 3cm. The brightest radio
source in the field is at RA 19:35:03.31, Dec -52:50:44.7 (posn. error
+/-0.1"). It coincides within the likely optical astrometric errors to
the candidate supernova proposed by Galama et al. (1998, GCN# 60) in
the barred spiral Galaxy ESO 184-82. Approximate flux densities
(corrected for primary beam attenuation) on April 28 were 9.3 mJy and
17 mJy at 6cm and 3cm, respectively.

Further observations of 1SAXJ1935.3-5252 are planned.
