E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories), M. Roth, and S. Gonzalez (Las Campanas
Observatory) report:

"We imaged the error circle of GRB 051016 (GCN #4096) with the Swope
40-inch telescope in I-band and with the Magellan telescope in J-band.  A
total of 10 min were obtained in I-band on Oct 16.345 UT and 20 min were
obtained in J-band on Oct 16.325 UT (2.9 and 2.4 hours after the burst,
respectively).  We do not detect any sources within the XRT error circle
which are not visible in the DSS.  The 3-sigma upper limits are I>20 mag
and J>21.7 mag."
