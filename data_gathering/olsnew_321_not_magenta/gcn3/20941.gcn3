Xing Wen (IHEP), Yi Zhao (IHEP), Yuanhao Wang (IHEP), 
report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-03-25T21:50:01.00 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground 
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 170325B, 
which was also detected by KONUS-Wind.

The POLAR light curve consists of a single peak,
with a duration (T90) of 6.47 s measured from T0+2.80 s.
The 500-ms peak rate measured from T0+4.50 s is 557.2 cnts/s.
The total counts is about 1196 cnts.

The above results are not dead time corrected. The above
measurements are in the energy range of about 80-500 keV.

All analysis results presented above are preliminary.

POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter (50-500 keV)
on-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 launched on
