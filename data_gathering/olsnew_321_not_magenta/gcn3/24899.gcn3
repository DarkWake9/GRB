Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190627A (trigger #911609)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 24888).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 244.843, -5.302 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  16h 19m 22.3s 
  Dec(J2000) = -05d 18' 08.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak, visible only in the softest
energy channels, with a duration of about four seconds.  The burst location
went out of the BAT field soon after T+400 sec due to a spacecraft slew.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.60 +- 0.28 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.04 to T+1.78 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.38 +- 0.38.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.9 +- 2.2 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.78 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

Although GRB 190627A has a brief duration, it is not clear that it is a short GRB.  
The duration and relative softness of the spectrum place it intermediate between 
most short and long bursts detected by BAT.
