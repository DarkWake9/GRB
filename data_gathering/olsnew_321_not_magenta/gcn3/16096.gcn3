S. Jeong, S. R. Oates, J. C. Tello, J. Gorosabel, A. Sota and A. J.
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB140408A by Swift (D'Elia et al., GCNC
16082), we observed the field of GRB 140408A with the 1.5 m OSN telescope
at Observatorio de Sierra Nevada in the R and I-bands. The observation
started on Apr 9, 04:01:16 UT (i.e. ~0.62 d post burst). No optical
afterglow is found at the position of the optical candidate reported by
Varela et al. (GCNC 16089) in the median combined images (6 x 300s)
down to 21.7 mag (I band) and 22.5 mag (R band) (3-sigma upper limits,
with all magnitudes in Vega system and no correction for the Galaxy
reddening)."
