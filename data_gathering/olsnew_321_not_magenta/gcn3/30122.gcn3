P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed further Swift-XRT data on the new SGR, Swift J1555.2-5402 (GCN
Circs 30120, 30121; ATEL 14674). Note that the name stated in GCN 30120 and
subsequent publications was incorrect: the object name is Swift J1555.2-5402.

The XRT has observed the SGR from T0+100 s to T0+5715 s, gathering 62 s of data
in Windowed Timing mode and 1.7 ks in Photon Counting mode. As reported by Coti
Zelati et al., (GCN Circ. 30121), our data show an X-ray source, for which we
find an enhanced position of RA,Dec = 238.78608, -54.06142, which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000.0)  = 15h 55m 08.66s
Dec (J2000.0) = -54d 03' 41.1"

with an uncertainty of 2.2" (radius, 90% confidence).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be well fit with a highly absorbed
power-law with a photon index of 2.3 (+1.0, -0.9) and an absorption column of
1.2 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10^23 cm^-2.

The light curve currently shows an approximately constant count-rate of one
count per second.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
