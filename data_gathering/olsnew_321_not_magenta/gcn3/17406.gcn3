We report further analysis of GRB 150204A.  The best BAT position is the same
as reported earlier (Cummings, GCN # 17404), RA, Dec 160.241, -64.043, which is:

RA (J2000)   10h 40m 57.8s
Dec (J2000) -64d 02' 34"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 1.5 arcmin.  The source was 77% coded
at the time of the burst.

The burst was a single symmetric cusp.  T90 was 12 +- 2 seconds.

A simple powerlaw function is the best fit to the BAT spectrum.  The photon index
is 1.62 +- 0.10.  The fluence from 15 to 150 keV in 13 seconds was
(8.0 +- 0.4) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.  The 1-second peak flux in this energy range was
1.85 +- 0.12 photons/cm^2.  All uncertainties are 90% confidence.

A Swift TOO has been approved.
