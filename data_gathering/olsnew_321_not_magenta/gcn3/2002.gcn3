We are observing the OT of GRB 030329 in R-band with MASTER system
(280 mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru). We began observations at 17:15UT
(~5h30m after GRB time).
Optical source (about 13.6 in R) was detected at the position given
in Circ 1985 in the beginning of observations. At 20:20UT (~8h40m after
GRB
time) magnitude became more than one magnitude fainter and it was about
14.8 in R. The OT seems to become fainter very slowly.
At present we have about 100 images of the OT. These images are
being processed.

These are preliminary results.
