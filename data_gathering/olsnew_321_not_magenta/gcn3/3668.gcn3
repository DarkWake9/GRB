on behalf of EAFON report:

" We started to image the GRB 050724 error region (Covino et al GCN
3665) at 14.26 UT (~1.69 hours after the burst) using 1.0-m telescope
at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. The source reported by Antonelli et
al. (GCN 3666) was detected in a series of R-band 300 sec
exposure. Our preliminary analysis shows the brightness of the source
do not have significant variability during our monitoring observations
(1.69-3.59 hours after the burst).

This message may be cited."
