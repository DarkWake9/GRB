"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060323 (GCN 4904) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 14:34:16 UT on Mar. 23.
After co-adding a set of 15 images (14:34:16 - 14:51:25 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 15.2 mag."
