E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Further analysis of this event (GCN 1679, 1683) reveals that it cannot
be localized to a single error box at this time.  The annulus reported in
GCN 1679 (RA, Decl(2000)=0.517, -35.271 degrees, radius 47.726
+/-  0.026 degrees, 3 sigma) can only be constrained to two alternate
error boxes.  One lies between between RA, Dec=296.8, -67.1 degrees,
and 297.4, -46.5 degrees, as reported in GCN 1683.  The other lies
between RA, Dec=44.5, -9.2 degrees and 56.0, -26.7 degrees.
