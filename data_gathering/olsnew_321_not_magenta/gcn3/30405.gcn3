report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 08:17:49.86 UT on 6 July 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210706A (trigger 647252274 / 210706346),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO pipeline
(Tohuvavohu et al. 2021, GCN 30393).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.1 s to T0+5.1 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.35 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 590 +/- 130 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.0 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 12.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
