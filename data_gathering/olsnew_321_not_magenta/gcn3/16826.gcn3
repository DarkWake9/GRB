W. Fong, P. Milne, N. Smith and J. Andrews (U. Arizona) report on behalf of
the Arizona Transient Exploration and Characterization (AZTEC)
collaboration:

"We observed the field of the Swift-detected GRB 140916A (Racusin et al.,
GCN 16819) with UFTI mounted on the 3.8-m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
(UKIRT) on Mauna Kea beginning on 2014 Sep 16.561 UT (2.7 hr post-burst).
In 36-min of J-band imaging, we do not detect any near-IR source in or
around the enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 16820; Osborne et al.,
GCN 16824). Calibrated to 2MASS, we therefore place a 3-sigma limit of
J(VEGA)>21 mag on the near-IR afterglow of GRB 140916A at 2.7 hr post-burst.

We thank T. Carroll for assistance with these observations."
