D. Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), C. Ferrigno, E. Bozzo, J.G. Victor (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a long gamma ray burst has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at
16:17:36 UT of 2016 December 19

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.= 188.437 deg
DEC.=  10.472 deg
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arc min (90% c.l.).

The burst lasts about 100 s and has peak flux of 1.2 photons/cmsq/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and fluence of 1.e-6 erg/cmsq (20-200 keV).

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
