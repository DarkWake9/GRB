The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:43:36 UT on 18 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210618A (trigger 645673421.140258 / 210618072).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 227.8, Dec = 42.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 11m, 42d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 106.0 degrees.
