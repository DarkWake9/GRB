TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2613
SUBJECT: GRB 040624 - A long GRB detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    04/06/24 14:35:34 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

A 45 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on June 24 at 08:21:35 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band but with a significance below the
threshold for automatic delivery of the IBAS Alert Packets. Its
coordinates (J2000)  are:

R.A.  13h 00m 09.9s
Dec. -03deg 35' 14''

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin  (90% c.l. radius)

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 0.5
photons/cmsq/s (5.4 x 10^-8 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).
