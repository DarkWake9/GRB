G. B. Ali, Y. Hendy, A. Takey, N. Essam, and A. Essam (NRIAG, Egypt) 
report on behalf of the Kottamia collaboration:

We observed the field of the Fermi GRB 160925A (trigger #496473540) with
the 1.88m telescope of the KAO (Kottamia Astronomical Observatory),
Egypt. The observation was performed in the Rc-band at the Newtonian
camera (F4.8) and started at 2016-09-29 T19:58:17 UT (~4.08 day after
the burst). 

We obtained several exposures in the Rc-band each one with 300s exposure
time.  We clearly detected the optical transient (Lipunov et al., GCN
19938; Guidorzi et al., GCN  19939). 

The following accurate photometry is obtained for the transient:
