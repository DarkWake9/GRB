W. Rujopakarn (Steward), E.S. Rykoff (UCSB) report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 080804 (Swift trigger 319016). The first image was at
23:20:34.3 UT, 19.6 s after the burst (6.3 s after the GCN notice time).
The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a
17.2 magnitude, brightening source with coordinates:

     21:54:40.1      -53:11:03.8    (J2000), with positional uncertainty
of 1" or better
