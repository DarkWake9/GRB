O. Godet, K. Page, P. Evans, A. P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), D. N.
Burrows (PSU), J. K. Cannizzo (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift XRT
team:

We analysed 26ks of XRT data for the short burst GRB 061210 (Cannizzo et
al., GCN Circ. 5904) taken between 2.42 days and 2.72 days after the BAT
trigger. Swift observed this burst late due to a Moon constraint. The
XRT/PC image shows two sources S1 and S2 in the BAT error circle located
at:

S1:    RA(J2000)=09h 37m 57.55s 
       Dec(J2000)=+15d 36' 30.8"
with an uncertainty of 4.1" (90% containment). The source S1 is 110"
from the BAT position quoted in Palmer et al. (GCN Circ. 5905).

S2:    RA(J2000)=09h 38m 05.17s 
       Dec(J2000)=+15d 37' 16.0"
with an uncertainty of 4.2" (90% containment). The source S2 is 30" from
the BAT position quoted in Palmer et al. (GCN Circ. 5905).

The two sources are uncatalogued. We note that a slightly elliptical
object located at 12.1" from the position of the source S2 is seen in
the DSS images. This corresponds to the source EO1509-0232011 in the
APM-North catalogue. It has a r-magnitude of 17.24 and a b-magnitude of
22.12.

With the data so far available we can not tell if either S1 or S2 are
fading. However, the XRT will continue to observe the field.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
