We observed the field of the gravitational wave event S200224ca (GCN
circular #27184) in r' band with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) equipped
with Omegacam (1 square degree FOV) (Proposal ID ESO 0104.D-0049).
We secured one epoch of observations on the night 2020-02-25 between
03:52:02 and 06:35:01 UTC with an average FWHM of 1.02 arcsec.

The observations cover 26 square degrees enclosing ~ 63% of the
localization probability region.
Each one square degree pointing is the coaddition of three dithered
exposures for a total exposure time of 135 seconds.

After image subtraction analysis using as reference image  PAN-STARR we
identify the following transients:
