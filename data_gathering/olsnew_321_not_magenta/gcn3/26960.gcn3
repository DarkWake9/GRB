We observed the field of GRB 200131A (Sbarufatti et al. GCN 26953) with the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 01-31-2020 starting at 23:28:45 UT (T+67
minutes). We performed a series of exposures in R filter. The weather
conditions were variable during the hours of observation and the zenith
angle at the start of observations was 54 degrees and setting. The midpoint
of the exposures is ~T+1.6 hrs. We observed the Swift XRT position with a
20'x20' field of view

We detect an uncatalogued source consistent with the UVOT position
(Sbarufatti et al. GCN 26953) and MASTER OT position (Lipunov et al. 26954)
with magnitude:

  R= 16.8 +/- 0.2

The magnitude is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and is
not corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the
commissioning phase.
