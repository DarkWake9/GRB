Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130627A (trigger #559132)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 14933).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 184.415, -37.114 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 17m 39.7s
  Dec(J2000) = -37d 06' 51.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 20%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-4 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+26.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 30.8 +- 12.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.2 to T+33.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.84 +- 0.32.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.1 +- 1.9 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.88 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
