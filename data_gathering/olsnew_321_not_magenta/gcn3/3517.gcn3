E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) reports:

"We obtained the UVOT V-band data from the Swift quick-look webpage and
performed aperture photometry on the two epochs discussed in GCN 3516.  
We find that the afterglow faded by 1.3 mag between the two observations 
rather than 3.6 mag as reported in GCN 3516."
