I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND and GRS, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB
at 47182 seconds (GCN 1550).  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately  5 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
4.6E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  3.5E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate areas are each 425 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  14 h  6 m  7.54 s     50 o 31 '  18.25 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 14 h  6 m 59.90 s     50 o 17 '  59.15 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 14 h  6 m 25.92 s     50 o 51 '  50.42 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 14 h  5 m 48.13 s     50 o 10 '  48.11 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 14 h  5 m 14.07 s     50 o 44 '  32.15 " 

or

ERROR BOX CENTER:  9 h 20 m 15.09 s      59 o 56 ' 35.43 "
ERROR BOX CORNER 5:  9 h 18 m 33.02 s     59 o 47 '  29.22 "
ERROR BOX CORNER 6:  9 h 20 m 57.27 s     60 o 16 '  39.32 "
ERROR BOX CORNER 7:  9 h 19 m 35.37 s     59 o 36 '  28.03 "
ERROR BOX CORNER 8:  9 h 21 m 58.62 s     60 o  5 '  30.99 "


These error boxes may be improved.  However, the Konus ecliptic latitude
response does not allow us to choose between them; this may become possible
if RHESSI observed this event.
