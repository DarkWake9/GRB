J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration,

report:

"Following the detection by SWIFT of the short-duration GRB 061217
(Barthelmy et al.  GCNC 5926, Parsons et al. GCNC 5930), we have obtained
BVR images at the 3.5m telescope (+PMAS) at the German-Spanish Calar Alto
Observatory. They were taken starting on Dec 17.1796 UT (i.e. 38 min 
post-burst), under good seeing conditions (1".0). 

The co-added frames (360s in R) starting 70 min after the
event do not reveal any new sources within the 4".7 radius of
the Swift/XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 5932) when comparing
to the DSS-2 red. 

There may be an R=22.1 faint object at the 3-sigma level, at
coordinates (J2000) 10:41:38.22 -21:07:35.13 +-0.5''. 

Further observations are planned."
