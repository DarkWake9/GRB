A. Kumar (ARIES), R. Gupta (ARIES), Dimple (ARIES), A. Ghosh (ARIES), A.
Aryan (ARIES), B. Kumar (ARIES), N Panwar (ARIES), S. B. Pandey (ARIES),

and K. Misra (ARIES) report:


We observed the XRT localized GRB 201014A (Swift trigger =1000255, Ambrosi
et al., GCN 28623; Perri et al., GCN 28638) using the 4Kx4K CCD Imager
(Pandey et al. 2018, 2018BSRSL..87...42P) mounted at axial port of the 3.6m
Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) of ARIES Nainital. The observations were
carried out on 2020-10-15 in Bessel R-band (300s X 2 frames) from UT
21:22:35 to 21:32:59 (corresponding to 22.6 hours after the BAT trigger
time).


No new optical source was detected within the Swift XRT enhanced error
circle (see also Pozanenko et al., GCN 28628; de Ugarte Postigo et al, GCN
28650, Zhu et al, GCN 28655). The aperture photometry on the stacked R-band
image was performed and calibrated against the USNO-B1 nearby stars.


The 3-sigma upper limit within the XRT error circle is as follows:


T_start-T0 (hours),       Start UT,            End UT,          Filter,
3-sigma upper limit

22.57, 2020-10-15 UT 21:22:35.8, 2020-10-15 UT  21:32:58.9,  R, >22.5 mag


The limiting magnitude is not corrected for Galactic extinction in the the
direction of the GRB.


3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) is a recently commissioned
facility in Northern Himalayan region of India (long:79 41 04E, lat:29
21 40N, alt:2540m)
owned and operated by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of
Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital (https://www.aries.res.in).
Authors of this GCN circular thankfully acknowledge consistent support
from the staff members to run and maintain the 3.6m DOT.
