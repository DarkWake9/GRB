report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:32:34.75 UT on 16 February 2020, the Fermi 
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200216B (trigger 603552759 / 200216564), 
which also triggered the Swift/BAT (D'Avanzo et al. 2020, GCN 27102).
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 27101) 
is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 78 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright pulse followed by 
some extended emission with a duration (T90)
of about 12.0 s (10-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum 
from T0-1.0 to T0+15.4 s is best fit by by a power law function 
with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is 0.07 +/- 0.30, and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 69.5 +/- 4.9 keV.

The fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval 
is (1.141 +/- 0.074)E-06 erg/cm^2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+2.3 s 
in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.95 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
