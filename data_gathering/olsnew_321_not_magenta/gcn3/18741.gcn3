The high probability northern arc of the Advanced LIGO skymap was mostly
occulted by the
Earth. The entire high probability southern arc was observed by Fermi GBM
during the GW
event. GBM was observing 45% of the cWB map probability.

A seeded search of the GBM Time-Tagged Event data between 8 keV and 40 MeV
from 30 s
before to 30 s after the CBC candidate event revealed no significant
emission on search
timescales in factors of 2 from 64 ms to 2.048 s. Additional blind searches
of the GBM NaI
detector data over several thousands of seconds before and after the CBC
candidate also
find no significant gamma-ray signal.
