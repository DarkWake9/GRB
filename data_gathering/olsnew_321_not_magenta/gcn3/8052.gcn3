Using the data set from T-239 to T+388 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080802 (trigger #318832)
(Baumgartner, et al., GCN Circ. 8051).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 270.729, -32.329 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 02m 55.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 19' 45.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-40 sec and ending at ~T+180.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 176 +- 50 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-31.1 to T+176.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.76 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-7.56 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.3 +- 0.0 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

Given the Galactic lon,lat being in the bulge, we can not rule out
a non-GRB source for this trigger.  All other factors point to a GRB.
