J. A. Kennea (PSU) and Alex Amaral-Rogers (U Leicester) report on behalf 
of the Swift/XRT team

On October 14, 2013 at 17:24 UT, Swift began a series of target of 
opportunity observations to cover the region around GRB131014A 
(Fitzpatrick et al., GCN #15332, Evans, GCN #15334), approximately 12.3 
hours after the burst was detected by Fermi. In Swift/XRT Photon Counting 
mode data we detect an uncatalogued point source at the following 
location: RA/Dec(J2000) = 100.30064, -19.09711, which is equivalent to:

RA(J2000) = 06h 41m 12.2s
Dec(J2000) = -19d 05m 49.6s

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.4 arc-seconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 11.3' from the LAT position reported by Desiante et al. 
(GCN #15333). The source brightness is 0.07 +/- 0.01 XRT count/s. We 
cannot yet confirm whether this source is fading.
