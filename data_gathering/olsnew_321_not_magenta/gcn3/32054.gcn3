report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 12:24:32.64 UT on 14 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220514A (trigger 674223877 / 220514517),
which was also detected by INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al. 2022, GCN 32041).

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization has been reported in GCN 32038.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 102 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 66 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.8 s to T0+64.8 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 139 +/- 21 keV,
alpha = -1.25 +/- 0.06, and beta = -1.92 +/- 0.06.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.0 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+28.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 16.6 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
