TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2099
SUBJECT: GRB030329, fading resumes
DATE:    03/04/05 15:55:16 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

   We previously reported (GCN 2092) a cessation of fading.
As Pavlenko et al. (GCN 2097) recently reported, this standstill
has ended. Our data from last night (030405UT) indicates a typical
V magnitude of 18.7 and the light curve now fits on the power law from
nights prior to the standstill.  The standstill was approximately 0.4mag
deviant from the power law, the one of the largest bumps so far
for this afterglow.  Due to the shortness of the standstill and
the lack of color evolution, this was not likely to have been the
predicted SNe bump.
