C. Pagani (U. Leicester), N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and J. R. Cummings 
(GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

We report on Swift follow-up observations of the Fermi/GBM GRB 140824B 
(Zhang, GCN Circ. 16743) centred at the position of the candidate 
optical counterpart reported by the MASTER II robotic telescope (Tyurina 
et al., GCNs 16740, 16741).

In 4.9 ks of XRT Photon Counting (PC) mode data, from 90.6 ks to 103.4 
ks after the Fermi/GBM trigger, no X-ray source is detected at the 
MASTER II position. The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate is 1.8E-03 
cts/s, which is 9.2E-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 using a typical flux conversion 
of 5E-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

The UVOT detected the reported candidate OT. The preliminary UVOT 
position is:
     RA  (J2000) =  01:11:01.14 =  17.75473 (deg.)
     Dec (J2000) = +60:33:38.6  =  60.56071 (deg.)
with an estimated uncertainty of 0.43 arc sec. (radius, 90% confidence).

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et 
al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the large, but 
uncertain Galactic extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.79 in 
the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998). The UVOT magnitudes 
when compared to the reported unfiltered  magnitudes of 17.0 and 17.5 by 
MASTER, suggest a slowly varying source.

Based on the Swift observations, the optical transient detected by 
MASTER II is therefore unlikely to be the GRB afterglow.
