SUBJECT: Second RXTE Observation of GRB 000115

F. E. Marshall (GSFC), T. Takeshima (USRA/GSFC),
T. Giblin & R.M. Kippen (UAH/MSFC) report:
 
RXTE observed GRB 000115 (BATSE Trigger 7954) for a second
time on 16 Jan. 2000 from 03:23 to 03:37 UT. Preliminary analysis
shows no significant detection of the X-ray afterglow indicating
that it is decaying at least as rapidly as t**-1.
The best-fit RXTE position (J2000) remains that determined from
the first observation (RA = 120.8, Decl. = -17.1). 
The 90 per cent confidence error box is approximately 0.3 degrees
wide in RA and 0.4 degrees wide in Decl. Substantial variability on
the time scale of an hour could cause an additional systematic
uncertainty in Decl.
