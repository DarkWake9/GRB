report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:43:31.19 UT on 25 January 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 200125B
(trigger 601677816 / 200125864) (Fermi GBM Team, GCN #26879),
which was also detected by Insight-HXMT/HE (Cai et al., GCN #26888).

The GBM light curve consists of multiple overlapping pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 5.8 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+12 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 175 +/- 3 keV,
alpha = -0.74 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.23 +/- 0.02.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.48 +/- 0.03)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 103.7 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
