N. Zimmerman, S. Tyagi, & J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) report:

"Using the MDM 2.4m outfitted with RETROCAM, we have obtained an upper
limit on the SDSS r-band magnitude of GRB 060105 as of Jan. 6 02:00 UT, or
19 hours after the burst. The sum of eight 5-minute exposures reveals no
new source within the refined XRT error circle (Godet et al,. GCN 4433) to
a limit of r = 21.0, as calibrated with Sloan standard stars."
