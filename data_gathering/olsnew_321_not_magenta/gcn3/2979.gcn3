Y. Yatsu and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of MITSUME
collaboration, 

"We observed the field of GRB050124 (GCN 2972, Markwardt et al.) with
the 50 cm Mitsume Telescope at Akeno, Japan in I band starting at 3.8
hours after the trigger.

We detected no new objects with following upper limits, as estimated by
comparison with the USNO A2.0 catalog.  

Start Time    stacked frames     upper limit

15:17:17 UT   30 sec x 100       I > 18.0   
16:11:07 UT   30 sec x 100       I > 18.5
17:04:18 UT   30 sec x 98        I > 18.8

The observing condition was not optimum due to the full moon and the
low elevation angle, but it improved with the increase of the target
elevation."
