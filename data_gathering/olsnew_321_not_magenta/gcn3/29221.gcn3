We observed the field of INTEGRAL Weak #8913 with the 14-inch
AGU Robotic Optical Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N)
located at the Sagamihara campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.

21 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
December 31 12:31:05 (UT) about 110 seconds after the trigger and stopped
on December 31 12:57:06 (UT).  We do not detect an optical afterglow
both in the individual images and the stacked image.  The estimated
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1260 sec)
is ~16.8 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
