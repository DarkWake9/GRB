DATE:    05/10/23 03:52:56 GMT
FROM:    Daniel E. Reichart at U.North Carolina  <reichart@physics.unc.edu>

D. Reichart reports on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Cobb & Bailyn (GCN 4142) are correct.  The correct J magnitude at 12.3
hours after the burst is 20.3 +/- 0.2 mag.

Using 4.1m SOAR, we observed the afterglow in BVRIYJHKs.  We will report on
the SFD in a forthcoming GCN.
