"At 03:53:57.11 UT on 6 March 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210306A (trigger 636695642 / 210306162).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (D'Elia et al., GCN 29597)
and Fermi/LAT (Ohno et al., GCN 29602).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.


The GBM light curve shows multiple overlapping pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 9.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.6 s to T0+11.6 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 59.4 +/- 2.2 keV,
alpha = -0.60 +/- 0.08, and beta = -2.53 +/- 0.06.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.82 +/- 0.20)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 26.6 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.



The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
