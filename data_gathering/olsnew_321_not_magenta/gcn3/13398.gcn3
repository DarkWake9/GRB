O.M. Littlejohns, P.T. O'Brien, P.A. Evans, K. Page (UL) and J.Racusin (GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Following the XRT observations of the BAT error circle for GRB 120624B reported in Littlejohns et al. (GCN Circ. 13394), we have compared the measured XRT flux of source S1 at 240 ks to that of bursts with similar or greater measured BAT fluence. Measurements of the XRT flux at approximately 240 ks for these bursts show that GRB 120624B lies at the faint end of the distribution of such bursts, should S1 prove to be the X-ray counterpart to GRB 120624B.

Further XRT observations are planned for Tuesday the 3rd July (2012), with a total exposure time of 10 ks, to check if either source S1 or S2 has faded.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
