On 3 June, the Chandra Observatory targeted the field of GRB030528, 
which was localized by the HETE satellite (Atteia et al, GCN2256). 
The 25 ksec observation spanned the interval 12:22-20:08 UT, 5.97 - 
6.29 days after the burst. The revised SXC error region from 
Villasenor et al. (GCN2261) was completely contained within the 
field-of-view of the Chandra ACIS-S3 chip (see planning comments in 
Ricker et al. GCN2264).

Within the revised SXC error region, we detected four sources in the 
0.5-8 keV band:

#      Chandra Name           RA           DEC       dR(s) dD(") Cts
  1 CXOU J170400.3-223710  17 4  0.31  -22 37  9.99  0.053  0.91  39
  4 CXOU J170348.4-223826  17 3 48.39  -22 38 25.93  0.054  0.92  30
  9 CXOU J170400.1-223548  17 4  0.11  -22 35 48.10  0.053  0.92	 11
10 CXOU J170354.0-223654  17 3 53.95  -22 36 53.67  0.054  0.93   9

The # column refers to the source's relative ranking (in terms of 
total counts) among all the sources detected in the entire ACIS-S3 
field-of-view. For completeness, we tabulate below seven additional 
sources that are within the ACIS-S3 field-of-view but are outside the 
revised SXC error region:

#      Chandra Name           RA           DEC       dR(s) dD(") Cts
  2 CXOU J170358.7-224237  17 3 58.67  -22 42 36.67  0.063  0.94  31

15 CXOU J170411.2-224032  17 4 11.24  -22 40 32.01  0.055  0.96  11

The astrometry was calibrated using six stars with detectable X-ray 
emission from the list generated by A. Henden (GCN2267) that lay 
within the ACIS-S3 field-of-view.

In the above 2 tables, dR, the uncertainty in RA, and dD, the 
uncertainty in DEC, were established by summing the following in 
quadrature for each coordinate: the X-ray centroiding error, the 
correlation error between the X-ray and optical positions, and the 
error estimates from the reference stars.

We gratefully acknowledge the timely assistance of the personnel at 
the Chandra Science Center in the acquisition and preliminary 
processing of these data.
