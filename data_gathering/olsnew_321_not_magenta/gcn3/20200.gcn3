The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161108A (Beardmore et al., GCN 20145) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Nov 08.19, Nov 09.40, Nov 
12.35 and Nov 15.36 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 20147), with 3sigma upper limits of 378 
uJy, 284 uJy, 190 uJy and 93 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
