Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the
recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis
of BAT GRB 160327A (trigger #680655) (Racusin, et al.,
GCN Circ. 19235). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 146.698, 54.018 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 46m 47.5s
   Dec(J2000) = +54d 01' 04.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 82%.

BAT light curve shows a single peak starting around
T-10 sec, peaking around T+5 sec and ending around
T+22 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 28 +- 9 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.30 to T+42.80 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power
law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.84 +- 0.11.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T+4.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at
the 90% confidence level.
