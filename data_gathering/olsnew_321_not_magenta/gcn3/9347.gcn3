Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:47:39.51  UT on 10 May 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090510B (trigger 263634461  / 090510325).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 269.4 , DEC = -57.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 17h 57m, -57d 56'), with an uncertainty
of 11.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The GBM light curve shows a single peak  with a duration (T90)
of about 7s (8-1000 keV).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100 degrees.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly 
constrained."
