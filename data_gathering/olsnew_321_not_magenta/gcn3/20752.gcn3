report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 83 observations of galaxies (from the
2MPZ catalogue) within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G275404,
using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap,
galaxy distances were taken into account in selecting which ones to
observe. The observations currently span from 17 ks to 42 ks after the
LVC trigger, and cover 9.9 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for
overlaps). This covers 0.014 of the probability in the LVC skymap, and
0.028 of the probability in the LVC map after convolving with the 2MPZ
galaxy catalogue, as described by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,  462,
1591).

No new X-ray sources have been detected.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
