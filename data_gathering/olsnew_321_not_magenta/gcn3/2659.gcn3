At 4-th sec  After  HETE alert 3510 (WXM data refined since S/C_Last
Notic) MASTER robotic telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had
automatically imaging  the corresponding area of the sky (01h 43m  after
trigger time).  On the first  image on 200 mm camera with 30 sec exposure
optical unfiltred limit is  equal about 16.2.

On image (UT 18h06m33s) optical limit is about 17.0.

The comparison between these images with the USNO-A2 catalog does not
reveal any new source.

We have 30 unfiltered images of the error box (30s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin) and 30 unfiltered images of the error box (60s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin).

The optical limit on sum of 30 fits (1 minute exposure) is about 19.5.

FITS image  are available at
