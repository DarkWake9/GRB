The long GRB 080513 localized by IPN (Golenetskii et al., GCN 7728)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=18849.927 s UT (05:14:09.927).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.02(-0.17, +0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+24.016 s
of (1.15 +/- 0.30)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+32.256 s) can be fitted (in the 20 keV-2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.48(-0.13, +0.12)
and Ep = 223(-38, +62) keV (chi2 = 76.6/61 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and only an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.19
(chi2 = 76.0/60 dof).

The spectrum of the most intense part (from T0+16.640 to T0+24.064 s)
is well fitted (in the same range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha =  -1.31(-0.12, +0.11)
and Ep = 317(-50, +73) keV (chi2 = 56.7/61 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and only an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.20
(chi2 = 56.5/60 dof).
The fluence of this part is (1.18 +/- 0.10)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
