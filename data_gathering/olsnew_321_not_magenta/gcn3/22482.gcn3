A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino, D. Fugazza (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the GRB 180314A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 22478) with the 60-cm robotic telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile).  The observations started at 00:45:38 UT, about 2 min after the burst, and were carried out for the first hour in the JHK bands. Then observations continued in the g, r, i, z, J, H and K bands.

A preliminary analysis shows that the optical counterpart (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 22478; Bolmer, GCN 22479; Lipunov et al., GCN 22481) is well detected and at a mid time of 165 seconds after the burst it was:

H = 12.9 +/- 0.1 (Vega)

Magnitude is calibrated against the 2MASS catalog.
