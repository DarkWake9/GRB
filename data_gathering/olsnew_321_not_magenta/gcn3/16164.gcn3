We observed the Swift GRB 140423A field (Sonbas et al., GCN 16142)
using 1.3m DFOT telescope at Devasthal operated by ARIES Nainital, India.
Observations were started at 14:36:07 UT on 2014-04-23 (~6 h after the
burst).
The optical counterpart of the burst (Elenin et al., GCN 16143; Kaur et
al.,
GCN 16144; Ferrante et al., GCN 16145; Chester et al., GCN 16147) was
clearly
detected in individual frames of exposure time 300s each.

The preliminary photometry is as following:

 (UT)Start     filter    exp(sec)       mag
 14:36:07     R_c       300            20.12 +/- 0.08
 14:42:50     I_c         300           19.76 +/- 0.15

The photometry was performed in comparison to nearby USNO stars.
