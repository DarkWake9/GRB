The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:40:28 UT on 25 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200525A (trigger 612110433.485766 / 200525611).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 20.6, Dec = -8.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 22m, -8d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
