A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO), D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg),
A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, Granada), A. Aguirre (CAHA),
C. Jordi (U. Barcelona) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the XRT error circle (Beardmore et al. GCN 7641)
of the possible intermediate GRB 080426 (H. Ziaeepour et al.
GCN 7639, J. Cummings et al. GNC 7640) with the 2.2m telescope
at Calar Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) at high airmass but
good conditions.

The observations started at 26 April 19:53:33 UT and were carried
out in B, V, R and I bands. In an I-band combined frame comprised
of 11x300s with mean epoch 7.50 hours after the burst, we do not
detect any source within the XRT error box down to a limiting
magnitude of I~22.5.

Further analysis is ongoing. This message may be cited.
