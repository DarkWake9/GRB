FROM:    Weidong Li at UC Berkeley KAIT/LOSS  <weidong@astron.berkeley.edu>

W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

"The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB050727 detected with Swift
(Trigger No. 147918).  A series of images was automatically
obtained from 06:33:35 UT (113s after the burst) to 06:54:04 UT
(1342s after the burst). The sequence includes a combination of
images taken with the V and I filters, as well as some that are
unfiltered. We did not detect a new object in our images when
compared to the DSS II images.  Our first 15s unfiltered image
started at 112.65s after the burst has a limiting magnitude of
about 18.2 when compared to the USNO-B1.0 catalog."
