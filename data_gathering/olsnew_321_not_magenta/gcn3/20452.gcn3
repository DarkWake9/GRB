report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:04:10.11 UT on 13 January 2017, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 170113A (trigger 505994655 / 170113420).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Evans et al., GCN 20446).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time is 145 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 49 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10 s to T0+47 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with
index -2.05 +/- 0.08.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.8 +/- 0.4)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.9 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
