S. Zharikov, H. Plana, G. Tovmassian (Observatorio Astronomico Nacional
IA UNAM, Ensenada, Mexico), J. Greiner (AIP, Potsdam, Germany) report:

" We have obtained two R-band (1200s and 600s) images of the GRB 000620
optical candidate (Bartolini et al., GNC737) field with the 1.5-m
telescope on July 1.17.
Photometric calibration was performed using PG1633+099BCD Landolt stars.

The R magnitude of object is 20.34+/-0.08. This object is visible on a
limit of DSS
also.
  We obtained  two R-band (600s, 600s) images of the VLA radio source
(E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) et al. GNC 738) also. A
faint object at the radio position is presented on DSS but no detected
down to R~21.5."
