The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:49:04 UT on 9 Jul 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210709A (trigger 647498949.307986 / 210709201).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 295.3, Dec = -44.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 41m, -44d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75.0 degrees.
