report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140614B (K. L. Page et al., GCN Circular #16394) with the 
optical three color (g, Rc, and Ic) CCD cameras attached to the MITSuME 50 cm
telescope of Akeno Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.

The observation started on 2014-06-14 14:18:14 UT ( 7.7h after the burst).
We did not find any new point source within XRT circle in all the three bands.


The measured magnitudes were listed below.
