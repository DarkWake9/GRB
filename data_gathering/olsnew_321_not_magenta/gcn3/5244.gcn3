H. A. Krimm (GSFC/USRA), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), C. Gronwall (PSU), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA), K. M. McLean (LANL/UTD) and
M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:32:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060607B (trigger=213934). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA,Dec 42.033, +14.736 {02h 48m 08s, +14d 44' 09"}
(J2000)  with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment,
including  systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve showed a
double-peaked  structure with a duration of about 25 sec. The peak
count rate  was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the
trigger. Swift did not slew to this burst due to the Sun constraint. 

Since this burst is only 33 degrees from the Sun, it will not be
observable by the Swift narrow field instruments until June 24.
