report:

The 2-m LCOGT Faulkes Telescope South began observing Swift GRB161014A 
(Racusin et al., GCN 20035) in the SDSS r and i filters on October 14, 
12:44:15 UT (~13 minutes since trigger). Within the BAT error circle we 
find an uncatalogued object at the following position:

RA(J2000)=  22:10:35.47
Dec(J2000)= +07:28:07.3

with a 1 arcsec error radius and a magnitude of i~18 as calibrated 
against nearby SDSS stars.
