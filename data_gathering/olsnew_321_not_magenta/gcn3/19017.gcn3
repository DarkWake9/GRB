We apologize for the incorrect dates and times of the observations in
GCN Circ. 18361. The whole report with the correct information is given
below.

We report optical imaging follow-up observations for a part of the
northern skymap regions of G184098 with 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope
and its 2.2 deg x 2.2 deg field-of-view camera, Kiso Wide Field Camera
(KWFC; Sako et al. 2012, SPIE, 8446, 84466L).

We took 180-sec exposure images in i-band for 5 fields as below (about
24 deg2 in total).

RA(J2000)   Dec(J2000)  starting UTC
09:05:35.52 +10:27:00.0 2015-09-18 19:06:02
09:14:32.16 +10:27:00.0 2015-09-18 19:11:37
09:23:28.80 +10:27:00.0 2015-09-18 19:16:59
09:32:25.44 +10:27:00.0 2015-09-18 19:22:22
09:41:22.08 +10:27:00.0 2015-09-18 19:34:29

The 5-sigma limiting magnitudes (AB) are 18.8 mag and 16.2 mag in the
first four exposures and the last exposure, respectively. The data
reduction and transient finding with image subtraction were performed
with the pipeline developed for Kiso Supernova Survey (KISS) as
described in Morokuma et al. (2014, PASJ, 66, 114). The SDSS i-band data
was used as reference images for the subtraction. We do not find any
transients which are likely associated with external galaxies.
