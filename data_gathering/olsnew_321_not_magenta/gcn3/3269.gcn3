NUMBER:  3269
SUBJECT: GRB050416: P200 NIR Observations
DATE:    05/04/16 14:58:48 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. Bradley Cenko, Derek B. Fox, and Avishay Gal-Yam (Caltech) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050416 with the Wide-Field Infrared
Camera (WIRC) mounted on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope.  Images
were taken in Ks-band and began approximately 6 minutes after the burst.
The afterglow candidate reported in GCN 3265 is clearly detected.  The
object fades by 0.8 mag from approximately 11:15 UT to 12:05 UT (10 - 50
minutes after the burst), confirming the results of Anderson et al. (GCN
3266).
