We have analysed the ground data from GRB 050826 (BAT Trigger #152113). 
We find a previously uncatalogued, fading x-ray source at the following 
coordinates:

RA(J2000):  05:51:01.3
Dec(J2000): -02:38:37.8

with an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This 
position is 2.7 arcminutes from the BAT position reported in GCN 3884 
(Mangano et al).
