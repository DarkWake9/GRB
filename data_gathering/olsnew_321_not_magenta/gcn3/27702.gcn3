B. Gendre, E. Moore, D. Coward, J.A. Moore (OzGrav-UWA),
A. Klotz (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 200509A detected by Swift
(trigger 970886, GCN 27701, Troja et al. 2020) with the Zadko robotic 
telescope (D=100cm) located at the Zadko Observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started about 6 hours after the GRB trigger. The 
elevation of the field was at 41 degrees above horizon at the start of 
the observation and decreasing, and weather conditions were good.

Inside the error box of the XRT afterglow, we did not detect any object 
at 2020-05-09T13:00:00, down to a R magnitude of 18.2. No further 
observations are planned.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
