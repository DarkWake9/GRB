The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:59:00 UT on 1 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201001A (trigger 623239145.485614 / 201001416).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 111.3, Dec = 6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 25m, 6d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
