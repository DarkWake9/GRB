A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), D. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT
team:
 
We have analysed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit observation of
GRB 060219 (Moretti et al. GCN 4788). We find an uncatalogued
source at the following location:
  
RA(J2000) = 16h 07m 21.08s
Dec(J2000) = 32d 19m 55.9s

We estimate an uncertainty of 6.7 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This position is 1.74 arcminutes from the BAT position given in GCN
4788.
 
This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
