SUBJECT: GRB 130215A: CARMA 3mm detection

D. A. Perley (Caltech) and G. Keating (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration:

We began observations of the position of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 
14204) with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy at a 
frequency of 93 GHz (3mm) starting at 03:28 UT, 1.95 hours after the 
burst.  Observations continued until 05:03 UT (midpoint t=2.73 hours.)

A provisional reduction of the data shows a strong detection of a source 
consistent with the location of the optical afterglow (Zheng et al., GCN 
14205).  We estimate a preliminary flux at this time of 2.99 +/- 0.39 
mJy.  Follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the CARMA staff for executing these rapid observations.
