Fermi GRB 160824B (Hamburg, GCN 19856; Yoshida et al., GCN 19873) was 
observed by Lomonosov on 16/08/24 around Fermi/CALET trigger time.

It was visible by all 3 detectors of BDRG  in energy range up to 1 MeV.
The parameters of GRB are:

Total duration ~3s.
Peak intensity in the range 20-1000 keV  >6 photons/cm2*s in the range 20-1000 keV
Peak intensity  in the range 250-1000 keV >2 photons/cm2*s

MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB160824B  (Hamburg et al, GCN 
19856) 62 sec after notice time and 107 sec after trigger time at 
2016-08-24 14:23:00 UT. On our first (20s exposure)  set we  found 56 
optical transient within FERMI error-box (ra=08 21 12 dec=+46 14 00 
r=3.833300) brighter then 15.83, but first alert   have a too large 
coordinate error and this region  is outside final error box.  We cover 
part of final error box 619 sec after trigger time at 2016-08-24 14:31:32 
UT by 3-th alert message. The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 18 mag on 
120 s exposure image. No OT was found.


MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk  was starded 
inspect inside  the  GRB160824B  (Hamburg et al, GCN 19856, Yoshida et al, 
GCN 19873) error box  1165  sec after trigger time at 2016-08-24 14:40:38 
UT.  We cover full 1 sigma + 3 degree systematic error box with  5-sigma 
upper limit  about 18 mag. 
No OT was found.
