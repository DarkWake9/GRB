report:

We imaged the field of GRB 141212A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 621229) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 123s after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
37 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We do not detect any optical counterpart of the XRT afterglow
(Ukwatta et al. GCNC 17158, Malesani et al. GCNC 17170).
We give the details of the limiting magnitudes during the
twelve first minutes after the trigger:

t0+123s to t0+153s : Rlim = 18.6
t0+162s to t0+192s : Rlim = 18.6
t0+200s to t0+230s : Rlim = 18.6
t0+239s to t0+269s : Rlim = 18.6
t0+279s to t0+309s : Rlim = 18.6
t0+320s to t0+410s : Rlim = 19.8
t0+421s to t0+511s : Rlim = 19.8
t0+522s to t0+612s : Rlim = 19.8
t0+622s to t0+712s : Rlim = 19.8

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+123s to t0+712s : Rlim = 20.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
