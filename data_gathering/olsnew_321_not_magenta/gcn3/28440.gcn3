A short-duration GRB 200916B
has been detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 56490 s UT (15:41:30).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   224.729 (14h 58m 55s) -39.130 (-39d 07' 47")
  Corners:
   225.036 (15h 00m 09s) -37.463 (-37d 27' 46")
   225.754 (15h 03m 01s) -37.404 (-37d 24' 14")
   224.398 (14h 57m 35s) -40.797 (-40d 47' 48")
   223.640 (14h 54m 34s) -40.848 (-40d 50' 53")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.88 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 3.8 deg (the minimum one is 32 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 61 deg.

This box may be improved.

This burst is spatially and temporally inconsistent with the 
IceCube-200916A event.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.

The Swift (BAT) event data used for the IPN localization
came from the GUANO system (https://www.swift.psu.edu/guano/).
