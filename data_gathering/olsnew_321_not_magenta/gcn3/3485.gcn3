SUBJECT: GRB050525: Super-LOTIS observations

P.A.Milne, G.G.Williams (Steward Obs), H.-S.Park (LLNL),
on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team report:
                                                                                      
We observed the field of GRB 050525 (SWIFT trigger 130088)
starting at UT=06:02:41 (05:59:48 after the burst),
with the 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope at Kitt Peak, AZ.
We obtained 20 x 30-sec images in each of the R,V and I
filters. Observing conditions were affected by thin clouds
in addition to the bright moon.
                                                                                      
Inspection of the three resulting co-added images reveals no source brighter 
than our limitting magnitude at the location of the candidate
optical counterpart first reported by Rykoff et al. (GCN 3465,3468).  
Comparisons were based upon the DSS2 image and the afterglow finders
provided by the ROTSE-III and TAROT collaborations.

 We report upper limits of: 

filter <UT>  upper limit
R     06:16    17.5
V     06:47    17.5
I      07:18    18.0
                                          
These values can be compared with the unfiltered detections reported by 
Durig et al. (GCN 3478).    
                                        
The upper limits are based upon three stars in the USNOB catalog,
1163-0325237, 1163-0325216, 1163-0325240.
