S. B. Cenko (Caltech) and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB070125 (Hurley et al., GCN 6024) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Our images were taken in the Kron R
filter at approximately 2:36 UT 26 Jan.  We identify a bright, stationary
source not present in the Digitized Sky Survey images at location
(J2000.0):

	RA: 07:51:17.75   Dec: +31:09:04.2

with an uncertainty of ~ 0.5" in each coordinate.  Comparison with nearby
objects in the USNO-B catalog indicates the source has an R-band magnitude
of ~ 18.6.  While we cannot identify any variability in our initial
images, we consider it likely that this object is the optical afterglow
of GRB070126.
