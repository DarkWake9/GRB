M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 14:15:54 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GS 1354-645 (trigger=646423).  Swift did not slew due to observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 209.512, -64.734, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 58m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 44' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger, there is nothing
of note in the real-time light curve. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+61.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

This source is currently in outburst as described in
ATel #7612, #7614, #7620, #7637, #7656 and has been
observed by Swift with a ToO campaign.
