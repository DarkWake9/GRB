D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), J.A.
Kennea (PSU) and K.L. Page report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 161105A (Page et al. GCN
Circ. 20131), from 560 s to 23.3 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 20135).

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=4.6 (+/-1.2), followed by a break at T+909 s to an alpha
of 0.86 (+0.14, -0.15).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.90 (+0.28, -0.15). The
best-fitting absorption column is  consistent with the Galactic value
of 4.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed
(unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this
spectrum  is 4.1 x 10^-11 (5.8 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     4.1 (+/-1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 4.1 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.90 (+0.28, -0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.86, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 4.5 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.8 x
10^-13 (2.6 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
