The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 05:08:58 UT on 5 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210605A (trigger 644562543.389178 / 210605215).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 21.7, Dec = -41.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 26m, -41d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 128.0 degrees.
