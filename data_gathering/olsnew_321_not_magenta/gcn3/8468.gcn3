Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081102 (trigger #333427)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 8462).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 331.178, 52.991 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 04m 42.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +52d 59' 27.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 36%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks, the first starting
at ~T-20 sec, peaking at ~T-15 sec, and hitting a minimum between the two
peaks at ~T-7 sec.  The second peak peaks at ~T+1 sec, and returns to background
at ~T+90 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 63 +- 16 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-20.2 to T+62.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.73 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
