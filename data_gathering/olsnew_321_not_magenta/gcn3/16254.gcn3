Alex Amaral-Rogers reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift has reobserved the field of GRB 140508A for a further 4.6 ks from 253.9 ks
to 288.1 ks after the Fermi/GBM trigger.

The source reported in GCN 16232 has been observed in the XRT to be fading;
consistent with a power-law decay with an index of alpha = 1.48 (+0.15, -0.14).

We now confirm the the source is the afterglow of GRB 140508A.
