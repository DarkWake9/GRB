We observed  the Swift J221951-484240 blue Optical Transient (Oates et 
al., GCN 25901; Oates et al., GCN 25939)   in the field of the 
LIGO/Virgo S190930t (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo 
Collaboration, GCN  25876). Several images were obtained in r' -filter 
of RC-1000 telescope. The OT was also previously observed by Kamei et 
al. (GCN 25941) and Buckley et al. (GCN 25962). Preliminary photometry 
of  the Swift J221951-484240 OT  is following.
