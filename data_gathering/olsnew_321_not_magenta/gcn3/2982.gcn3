The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of GRB050124
(GCN 2972) on January 24, 2005, at 14:34:56 UT.  The spacecraft did not
autonomously slew to the burst since automated slewing was not enabled.  The
observation was performed as a Target of Opportunity beginning about 3 hours
after the burst.  Based on comparisons to the USNO-B1.0 Catalogue, we detect no
source down to a magnitude of 17.4 in the V-filter for a 100 second UVOT Finding
Chart exposure.  We caution that the instrument is not yet fully
calibrated and that this magnitude limit is an estimate.
