Subject: GRB 140323A: Fermi GBM observation

Hoi-Fung Yu and Andreas von Kienlin (MPE)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:22:53.12 UT on 23 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140323A (trigger 417262976 / 140323433),
which was also detected by Swift/BAT and XRT (Troja et al. 2014, GCN 16027).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 31 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks in two main episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 111 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.560 s to T0+138.755 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.09 +/- 0.02 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 142 +/- 4 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.15 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024 s peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+25.0884 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 9.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
