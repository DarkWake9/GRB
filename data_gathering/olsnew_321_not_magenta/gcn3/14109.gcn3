We observed GRB 121226A (Swift trigger 518731, Krimm et al. 2012, GCNC
14105) field with the 1.04m telescope at ARIES, Nainital starting at

time 
of 300 sec each, were obtained.

Within the XRT error-circle, we do not detect any optical source down to 
following limiting magnitudes.

Dec 26.9118 UT, 300sx4, I_c ~ 18.8 mag
Dec 26.9292 UT, 300sx6, R_c ~ 19.5 mag
