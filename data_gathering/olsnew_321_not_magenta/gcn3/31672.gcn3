The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:28:58 UT on 4 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220304A (trigger 668064543.786552 / 220304228).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 245.0, Dec = -35.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 19m, -35d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 145.0 degrees.
