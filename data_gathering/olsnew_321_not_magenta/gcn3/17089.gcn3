We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with AS-32 
(0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory. Observations were performed 
under mean seeing (FWHM) of 3.5". We obtained several unfiltered images 
on Nov. 21 starting on (UT) 20:01:35.  Within enhanced XRT position 
(Evans et al., GCN 17080) we clearly detected  afterglow of GRB 141109A 
(Tanga et al., GCN 17078; Perley et al., GCN 17081). Preliminary 
photometry is following:

2014-11-21 20:01:35  0.73241     clear   54*120  20.08 0.05

The photometry is based on several SDSS-DR9 stars R magnitudes 
transformed from SDSS-DR9 based on Lupton transformations:
