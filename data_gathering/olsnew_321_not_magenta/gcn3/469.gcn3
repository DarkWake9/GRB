We imaged a 15'x15' field centered at the RXTE localization of
the GRB991216 (T.Takeshima et al.) with the FLWO 1.2m telescope
and IR Camera on Dec 17.23. We find one object in our images that
is not on the digitized sky survey. The object is stellar with
a J magnitude of approximately 17. The position based on the
Guide Star Catalog is 05:09:24.29 11:10:39 (2000). From the
difference in color between the DSS and the J-band, this may be
an extremely red star and we are monitoring it to look
for variability. Shorter wavelength observations are suggested.
