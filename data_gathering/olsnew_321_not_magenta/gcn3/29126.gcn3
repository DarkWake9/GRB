The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:03:25 UT on 22 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201222B (trigger 630327810.6864 / 201222461).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 95.7, Dec = 27.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 22m, 27d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 107.0 degrees.
