A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo, M.G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), K.L. Page, P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 150710B (Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 18009). The observations now extend from T0+115 ks to T0+259 ks.

The source reported by Melandri et al. (GCN Circ. 18018) has significantly faded between two epochs, down to a level of (7 +/- 2)e-3 cts/s, and is therefore the GRB afterglow.

The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020542.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
