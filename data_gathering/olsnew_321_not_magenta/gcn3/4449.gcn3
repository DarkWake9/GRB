K. Mitsuda, R. Fujimoto, T. Inui, T. Murakami and the
Suzaku GRB-ToO team reports:

The Suzaku narrow field instruments: XIS and HXD started observation
of GRB060105 from 12:10 UT on 2006-01-05 (Mitsuda et al. GCN 4432),
at 5.4 hours after the Swift BAT detection (Ziaeepour et al. GCN 4429).
Preliminary analysis shows a fading X-ray source at the reported XRT
position (Godet et al. GCN4433). The intensity decreased to 1/3 of
the initial at the end of observation, 12:00 UT on 2006-01-06.
The averaged flux during the observation is approximately
7x10^-13 erg/s/cm2 (2-10 keV). Detail analysis is in progress.
