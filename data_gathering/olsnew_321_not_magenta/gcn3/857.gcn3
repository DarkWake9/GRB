TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  857
SUBJECT: GRB 001018, Possible Radio Afterglow

G. B. Taylor (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We imaged the IPN error box of GRB001018 (GCN #853) with the VLA at
8.46 GHz, starting on Oct. 19.88 UT.  A second observation was
obtained starting on Oct. 20.76 UT.  One unresolved radio source (size
< 0.25 arcsec) is detected within the IPN error box at (J2000) R.A.=
13 14 12.385, Dec. =11 48 57.90 with an error of approximately 50 mas
in each coordinate.  The VLA flux density at 8.46 GHz was 258 +/- 65
microJy on Oct 19.88, and 405 +/- 50 microJy on Oct 20.76.  No source
is detected in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ,
115, 1693) above their flux limit of 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz.  Based on its
compact and possibly variable nature we suggest that the source VLA
J1314+1148 could be the radio afterglow from G001018.  Further
observations with the VLA are planned."
