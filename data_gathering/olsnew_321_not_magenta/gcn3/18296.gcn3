In the GCN 18263 (Levan et al. 2015), the galaxy NGC 3313 (z=0.0124, d=54 Mpc), which lies within the detection horizon of Advanced-LIGO/VIRGO, is presumed to be the host galaxy of GRB 150906B. Consequently, the isotropic energy of GRB 150906B is inferred Eiso~10^{49} erg. In the GCN 18259 (Golenetskii et al., 2015) from Konus-Wind, the time-averaged spectrum of GRB 150906B fitted by a cutoff power law gives the peak energy Ep = 928(-95,+111) keV in the observer's frame.

From previous GRB statistics (see attached figure [1] and ref. [2]), a typical short GRB with Ep~1 MeV corresponds to Eiso~10^{51} erg. With a fluence of 2.8(-0.2,+0.2)x10^{-5} erg/cm2 from GCN 18259, the redshift of GRB 150906B is expected to be z > 0.06 (266 Mpc), most probably z~0.12 (555 Mpc). Therefore the host galaxy of GRB 150906B could be one of the others nearby.

This type of short GRBs with Eiso < 10^{52} erg originate from merging neutron stars (NSs) leading to a massive NS and not to a black hole [3]. In view of the small value of the energetic, we indicate these sources as short gamma-ray flash (SGRF). As opposed to the more energetic short gamma-ray bursts, the SGRFs never have GeV emission.
