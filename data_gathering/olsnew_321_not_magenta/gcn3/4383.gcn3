E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories), A. M. Soderberg (Caltech), B. P. 
Schmidt (ANU), and P. A. Price (IfA) report:

"We obtained a second epoch of r-band imaging with GMOS on Gemini-north 
starting on 2005 Dec. 22.195 UT (26.8 hr after the burst and 24 hr after 
the previous set of observations).  A total of 960 sec were obtained in 
excellent seeing conditions.  We find that the optical afterglow candidate 
(GCN 4375; see also GCNs 4367 & 4369) has faded by about 1.1 mag between 
the two epochs, confirming our earlier claim."
