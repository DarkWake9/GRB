K. Torii (Osaka University) reports:

 A part of the error region of GRB 041016 (HETE trigger 3578) was
observed with a remote telescope (0.30-m Cassegrain equipped with
FLI-IMG1024S CCD camera and clear filter) in the New Mexico Skies
observatory.  The observation started at 2004 October 16, 07:14 UT and
300-s integration was repeated. The observed field was 24x24
arcminutes centered at (R.A., Dec.) = (01 44 53, -04 17 14) (J2000).

 Preliminary comparison of the first 5 frames with the USNO-A2.0(R)
catalog does not show a new object brighter than ~16 mag.
