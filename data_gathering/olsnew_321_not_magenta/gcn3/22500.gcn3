A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Deich (PSU),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 04:57:25 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180316A (trigger=814677).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 265.436, +0.737 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 41m 45s
   Dec(J2000) = +00d 44' 11"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:59:00.5 UT, 95.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 265.4290, 0.7497 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +17h 41m 42.96s
   Dec(J2000) = +00d 44' 58.9"
with an uncertainty of 6.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 52 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 104 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.27. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Melandri (andrea.melandri AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
