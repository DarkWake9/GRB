The long GRB 200219C (Fermi GBM detection: Fermi GBM Team,

Fermi-LAT detection: Dirirsa et al., GCN Circ. 27151;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200219C.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:57:10.630 UTC
on 19 February 2020. The burst signal was seen by only the SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked pulse which starts at T+0.1 sec,
peaks at T+1.6 sec and ends at T+4.6 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 4.0 +- 0.7 sec and 2.1 +- 0.9 sec (40-1000
keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
