(Urumqi No.1 Senior High School), J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 211129A (Gropp et al. GCN Circ. 
31136) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. We obtained 18x120 s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 
12:38:57 UT on 2021-11-29, i.e., 2.8 hr after the BAT trigger.

No optical source is detected at the Enhanced Swift/XRT position (Goad 
et al. GCN Circ. 31139) in our stacked image, down to a limiting 
magnitude of r~21.2, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
