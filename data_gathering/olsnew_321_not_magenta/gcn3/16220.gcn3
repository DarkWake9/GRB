P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:07:36.88 UT on May 6 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140506A (trigger 421103259/140506880),
which was also detected by 
Swift (B.P. Gompertz et al. 2014, GCN 16214).  
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/XRT location.

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight
 is 135 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one main peak near T0 and a
late, smaller peak at ~T0+60 s with a duration (T90) of about
64 s (50-300 keV).  The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-1.9 s to T0+2.2s is well fit by a Band function with an
Epeak of 141 +/- 36 keV, alpha = -0.9 +/- 0.2 
and beta = -2.0 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.5 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 in the 10-1000 keV band
is 14.2 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
