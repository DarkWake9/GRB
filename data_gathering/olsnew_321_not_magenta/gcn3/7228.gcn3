TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7228
SUBJECT: GRB 080129: Swift XRT position
DATE:    08/01/29 07:22:11 GMT
FROM:    Matteo Perri at ISAC/ASDC  <perri@asdc.asi.it>

M. Perri (ASDC), G. Stratta (ASDC) and D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing the possible GRB 080129 (trigger #301981,
Immler et al., GCN Circ. 7226) at 07:00:08 UT, about 53 min after the
BAT trigger.

Analysis of prompt downlinked data finds an uncataloged X-ray source
located at RA, Dec 105.2848, -7.8463 which is
   RA(J2000) = 07 01 8.35
   Dec(J2000) = -07 50 46.8
with an uncertainty of 3.3 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This location
is 71 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within the BAT error
circle (Immler et al., GCN Circ 7226). Further analysis will be
reported in a subsequent circular.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
