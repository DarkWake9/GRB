Using on-line data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the
recently reported LIGO/Virgo S191105e event using the 90% contour of the Initial bayestar probability
map provided by the GW interferometers (GCN#26182 <https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/26182.gcn3>). The ANTARES visibility at the time of the
alert, together with the 50% and 90% contours of the probability map are shown at http://antares.in2p3.fr/GW/S191105e_Initial.png <http://antares.in2p3.fr/GW/S191105e_Initial.png>.
Considering the location probability provided by the LIGO/Virgo collaborations, there is a
66.4% chance that the GW emitter was in the ANTARES **upgoing** field of view at the time of
the alert.

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded in the ANTARES sky during a
+/-500s time-window centered on the time 2019-11-05 14:35:21 and in the 90% contour of the S191105e
event. The expected number of atmospheric background events in the region visible by ANTARES is
5.16e-04 in the +/- 500s time window. An extended search during +/- 1 hour gives no
up-going muon neutrino coincidence. The expected number of atmospheric background events in the
region visible by ANTARES is 3.72e-03 in this larger time window.

ANTARES is the largest undersea neutrino detector, installed in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is
primarily sensitive to neutrinos in the TeV-PeV  energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular
resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a
competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
