We observed the field of GRB 160816A detected by Fermi (Racusin et al.,
GCN Circ. 19802) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) T7
(17" Plane Wave) telescope located at the AstroCamp Observatory (Nerpio, Spain).
15 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
August 16 22:50:57 (UT) about 5.9 hours after the trigger and stopped on
August 16 23:26:36 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the
individual images and the stacked image at the X-ray afterglow position
(Kennea et al., GCN Circ. 19806).  The estimated five sigma upper limit
of the combined image (total exposure of 900 sec) is ~18.3 using the
USNO-B1 catalog.
