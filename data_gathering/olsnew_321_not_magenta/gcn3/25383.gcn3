We observed the targets listed below, within with the updated 90% probability region of S190814bv (LIGO Scientific 
Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25333), with the 3.6m Italian TNG telescope (Canary Islands, Spain), 
equipped with the NICS infrared camera in imaging mode. 
Observations were carried out on 2019 Aug 17 between  03:53 and 05:04 UT. Conditions were affected by clouds.

desgw-190814e/AT2019nqs 01:33:35.16  -31:46:48.48
DG19sevhc/AT2019npy        01:33:35.16  -31:46:48.48
ESO474-026                         00:47:07.53  -24:22:14.33


The first two targets were reported as possible candidate counterparts of S190814bv (Andreoni et al., GCN Circ. 25362; 
Herner et al., GCN Circ 25373; Dichiara et al., GCN Circ 25374). We observed these two targets with the J filter, with an 
exposure of 20 minutes per target. 

We do not detect desgw-190814e/AT2019nqs, likely because the source has a very small offset from its host galaxy center. 
We can barely detect DG19sevhc/AT2019npy. After image subtraction with a template image from the 2MASS catalogue we 
obtain for DG19sevhc/AT2019npy a marginal detection with magnitude J = 18.3 +/- 0.3 (AB; obtained with PSF photometry). 

The galaxy ESO474-026 was observed with the Ks filter, with an exposure of 20 minutes. Visual inspection does not reveal 
any new candidate. 

The average 3sigma upper limits of our images are J ~ 20.5 (AB) and Ks ~ 20 (AB), calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue.
