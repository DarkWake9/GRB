 "The error region of GRB 050408 (Sakamoto, et al. GCN 3189) was
observed by the ART 14-inch telescope. BVRcIc imaging started at 2005
April 8, 16:23:48 UT (57-s after trigger) and 60-s exposure in each
filter was repeated.

 The optical afterglow (de Ugarte Postigo, et al. GCN 3192) is not
detected in our frames and the following 3-sigma upper limits are
derived relative to USNO-A2.0 (R).
