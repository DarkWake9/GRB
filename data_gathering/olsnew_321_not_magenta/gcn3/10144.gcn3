behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 091109 (Oates et al. GCN 10138)
using the 0.6 Yock-Allen robotic telescope (BOOTES-3) located in
Bleinheim, New Zealand. Due to bad weather conditions, observations
did not start until 11:03 UT (6.1h after the burst). A combination of  
the
first 30x60s unfiltered exposures does not show any source at the
UVOT postion down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of R~20.0,
consistent with the limits given by UVOT (Oates et al. GCN 10143) and
the fainter detection by Faulkes Telescope South (Guidorzi et al. GCN
10142).

Further observations are ongoing.
