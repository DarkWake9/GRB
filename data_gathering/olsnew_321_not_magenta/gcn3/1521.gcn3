M. Uemura, R. Ishioka, T. Kato (Kyoto U) and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U) report
on behalf of VSNET-grb collaboration:

  "We have performed a full analysis of the unfiltered images of GRB
020812 field taken at Kyoto University.  A 30-cm telescope observed
the central part of the on-board HETE WXM error box, and a 25-cm
telescope observed three fields of view, each of which covered a part
of HETE WXM error box (GCN 1468)
(http://www.rc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~yamaoka/GRB020812/FOVkyoto.gif). 
The limiting magnitudes are measured by compareing with USNO-A2.0 red
magnitudes.  

FOV	  25-cm 1	 25-cm 2	 25-cm 3 	30-cm 
epoch	 11:36-13:25	13:27-13:57	13:57-15:32	11:40-13:26 Aug. 12 UT+
exp.	 85		25.5		80		83.5	minutes
lim.mag  18.7		18.6		18.8		19.1	in R

  By comparison with DSS 2 red image and Ouda images (GCN 1515),
no new source brighter than the limits nor notable variable is
detected."
