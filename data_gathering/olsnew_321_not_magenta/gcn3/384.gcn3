"The BeppoSAX NFIs observed the region of GRB990705 (IAUC 7218) from
Jul 6.142 (11 hours after the BeppoSAX GRBM+WFC trigger) to Jul 8.096 UT
for a total MECS on source exposure time of 78 ksec.

A preliminary analysis of the data shows a strong and variable contamination 
of the field by stray radiation coming from LMC X-2, which lies just outside 
the detector field of view (52 arcmin from the center). A more refined 
analysis is required and at this stage we are not able to confirm the 
quick-look analysis detection reported in GCN #373.
