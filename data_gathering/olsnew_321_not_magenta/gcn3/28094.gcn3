report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2020-07-11T11:04:32.93 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 200711A (trigger ID: HEB200711461) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Fermi-GBM (Poolakkil et al. GCN 28080) 
and Swift-BAT (Marshall et al. GCN 28078).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 9.15 s measured from T0-0.64 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+3.56 s, is 1098 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 3109 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 
 
Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
