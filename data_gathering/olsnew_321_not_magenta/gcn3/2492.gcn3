A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

This burst (GCN 2487, 2488) was also observed by Mars Odyssey (GRS) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS).  As observed by Wind and Helicon, it had a 15-8000
keV fluence of approximately 3.4E-04 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  2E-03 erg/cm2 s over 0.004 seconds. This event had a
hard spectrum with Epeak = 2000 +/- 80 keV.  As reported in GCN 2487
and 2488, it had a duration of ~0.3 s, which places this GRB in the
short/hard class.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
area is ~70 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

     RA(2000)    Dec(2000)
     245.525   -11.207
     245.478   -11.300
     245.471   -11.715
     245.423   -11.817

This error box may be improved.
