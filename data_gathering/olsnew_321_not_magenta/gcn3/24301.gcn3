We used the 1m telescope at the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan to obtain g-
and r-band images of the transient found by Swift/UVOT (GCN 24296). The
observations started at 2019-04-28 19:30 UT and the exposure time is 300s
for both filters. With a limiting magnitude of about 21.5 (AB) by comparing
to PS1 images, we do not detect the UVOT transient.
