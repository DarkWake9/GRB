Swift Team:

At 10:07:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090927 (trigger=370846). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 343.953, -70.978 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 55m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = -70d 58' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 1.5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+33.8 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Grupe (grupe AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
