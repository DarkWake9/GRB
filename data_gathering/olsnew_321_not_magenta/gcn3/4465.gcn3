J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

"In rapid PAIRITEL imaging of the field of GRB050110 (Zane et al. GCN  
4463) beginning at 08:06:43 UTC, we find a bright point-like object  
not detected in 2MASS at (J2000):

   14:50:57.9
  +28:25:49

(+/- 1"). Given the proximity to the ecliptic plane of the burst,  
this source may not be related to the GRB. Further monitoring is  
suggested."
