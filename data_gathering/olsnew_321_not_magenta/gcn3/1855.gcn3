report:

"We have imaged a 7' x 7' region centred on the                      
error box for GRB 020304 (Hurley et al., GCN 1854)                      
with the 1.5-m telescope at Observatorio de Sierra                      
Nevada in Granada, Spain. One unfiltred  frame and                      
one R-band frame (300-s exposure time each) were                      
obtained on Feb 4.879 UT (i.e. 8.3 hours after                      
the GRB) under poor meteorological conditions.                      
When comparing to the DSS-2 (R-band), no optical
counterpart is found down to a limiting magnitude                      
of R = 19.7 in the central region (coverage ~35%)
of the error box."
