report:

"We have imaged the GRB 050911 error box provided by Swift/BAT
(Page et al.  GCN 3961) with the 0.6m telescope (+MOA camera)
at Mt. John Observatory. 5 x  300s second integrations in
the wide R-band filter were taken starting at 16:35:16 UT
(i.e. 36 min after burst). Within the refined Swift/BAT error
box (Tueller et al. GCN 3964), the coadded image does not
reveal any variable object down to R~21 when comparing to
the DSS-2."
