The coordinates for GRB 220606B reported in GCN 32167 were transposed
in the declination, and therefore incorrect.

The correct coordinates of the GRB localization candidate are:

RA, Dec = 28.474, -54.741 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  = 01h 53m 53.76s
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 44′ 27.6″
with an estimated uncertainty of 5 arcmin.

The Swift XRT/UVOT ToO followup is at the correct position.
Sincere apologies for the transcription error.
