Markku Nissinen (Taurus Hill Observatory) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus
Hill Observatory) report:
 

We used Global-rent-a-scope GRAS002 Tak Mewlon 0.30m telescope with SBIG ST-8E
CCD at RAS Observatory Mayhill H06 (New Mexico, USA) for follow-up observations
of GRB090530 (J.K. Cannizzo et al., GCN 9438). The observations were started 
on May 30, at 05:30 UTC (2.2 hours after the burst) and stopped on May 30, 
at 06:16 UTC. Four unfiltered 600 seconds images were taken. We detected 
very faint optical afterglow object at the position of RA 11h 57m 40s.6 and 
Dec +26o 35' 38".7 (J2000) with respect to POSSII F/USNO-B1.0 and this is in 
good correlation with ROTSE-III optical counterpart position (H. Flewelling 
et al., GCN 9439). Upper limit for the observations is >20.2 mag (3UL). Quoted
upper limit has been derived using POSSII F and USNO-B1.0 field stars as 
reference.
