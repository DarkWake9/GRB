We have continued the analysis of Swift-BAT GRB 050202 (Tueller, et al.,
GCN Circ 3005).  The refined position is 290.575, -38.735 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, statistical plus systematic).
We find that the T_90 time for this burst is 0.080 sec.  The ~150 sec
long-term variation on which the spike rides (Circ 3005) has been shown
to be due to Sco X-1.  A fluctuation from Sco X-1 also contributed
to the larger duration value given in Circ 3005.

We have fit the burst spectrum with power-law: index 1.4 +-/0.3.
This short burst is in the intermediate hard range.

In the 15-350 keV band, the fluence is 6.5e-8 erg/cm2 and the peak flux
is 4.8 ph/cm2/sec.

We note that the the Swift spacecraft did not slew to this burst
because the burst location was within the Sun observing constraint.
