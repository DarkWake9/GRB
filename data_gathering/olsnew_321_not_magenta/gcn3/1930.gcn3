K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Mars Odyssey teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin, on
behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

This event was observed by Ulysses and Mars Odyssey (GRS and HEND).
Its Earth-crossing time was 13102 +/- 287 s.  (The uncertainty is
due to the fact that no near-Earth spacecraft has reported this
event so far.)

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 20 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.3E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  3.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl (2000) =  323.478, -42.567 degrees, with radius 31.976 +/- 0.057
degrees.

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.  As it seems
likely that this event was observed by a near-Earth spacecraft,
a small error box can probably be derived for it.
