We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 21106 using the 40cm UCD Watcher telescope at Boyden Observatory in South Africa.

Observations started on May 19th at 16:30 UT (T0+11.5h) and consisted of a series of 20s exposures in SDSS r’ filter for a total monitoring time of 3 hours. Based on combined images with mid-time at 17:00 UT, we derive a preliminary magnitude of r’=19.3 +/- 0.3 (AB system).

Magnitudes were calibrated using 2 nearby APASS stars. No correction for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB has been applied.
