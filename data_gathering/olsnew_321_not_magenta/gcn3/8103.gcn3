P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and  D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the field centered at the UVOT position of the Swift burst
GRB 080810 (GCN 8080) using the Very Large Array (VLA) at a frequency
of 8.46 GHz and starting at 2008 Aug 13.36 UT. We detect the radio flux
at the GRB afterglow position  with the flux density of 151 ± 50 uJy.
