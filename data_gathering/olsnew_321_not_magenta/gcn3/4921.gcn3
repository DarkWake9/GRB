Brian Lindgren Jensen, Jens Hjorth, Johan Fynbo (Dark Cosmology Centre)
and Hugo Schwarz (CTIO) report:

"We have, further to Jensen et al. (GCN 4915), obtained R band
observations of GRB 060323 (Vetere et al., GCN 4904) with the 2.56-m
Nordic Optical Telescope and StanCam at La Palma. Observations started
at UT 24.95 (32hr after the burst) and cover the position of the Swift
XRT source (Kennea et al., GCN 4909).

The afterglow candidate (Covino et al., GCN 4911) is not visible in our
combined image to an approximate upper limit of R~24. We hence confirm
the conclusion of Covino et al. (GCN 4916) that the optical afterglow
has been correctly identified.
