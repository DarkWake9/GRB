Martin Jelinek, Rene Duffard, Pablo Santos Sanz
and Alberto J. Castro Tirado (IAA CSIC Granada)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We observed the errorbox of the SuperAGILE
GRB081001 (Lazzarotto et al., GCN 8305) with the
40cm ASH-Centurion telescope at Cerro Burek in
Argentina starting at 23:28 UT.

The combined 600s unfiltered image with exposure
mid-time 2.30h after the GRB trigger does not
reveal any new source down to limiting magnitude
of ~19.0 in comparison to the Digitized Sky
Survey.
