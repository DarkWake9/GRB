End of BeppoSAX mission on April 30, 2002

After exactly six years from the launch, BeppoSAX will be switched off
by ASI on April 30, 2002 at 4:30 UT, following procedures
internationally established for spacecraft decommission.

Nothwithstanding problems recently developed with one of the on-board
battery and the orbital decay due to enhanced solar activity, in the
last few months the mission has continued to deliver important results,
including the four recent GRB of March and April.

Operations for GRB detection, localization and follow-up will continue
to be carried out as usual until April 30.  The re-entry should take
place in between the end of this year and the beginning of the next.

We thank all the GRB scientists for using BeppoSAX data, for
following-up with their instruments the BeppoSAX GRB positions and for
the strong support given to the extension of the mission until April 30.
