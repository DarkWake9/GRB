C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 191215A (GCN 26435),
the reported position:

RA: 285.87 (+2.88 -3.19 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 58.92 (+1.85 -2.25 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 27.1 minutes prior
until 1.6 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations are not
constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
