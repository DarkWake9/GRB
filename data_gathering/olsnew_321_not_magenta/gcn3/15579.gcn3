report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131205A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 580267) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 3.74h after the GRB trigger
which occured during Australian day time.
The elevation of the field increased from
19 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were excellent.

We co-added a series of exposures but
we do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+3.74h to t0+4.45h : Rlim = 20.2

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
