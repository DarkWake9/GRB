TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2551
SUBJECT: GRB 040323: a long GRB detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    04/03/23 14:15:09 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

S. Mereghetti, D.Gotz (IASF-Milano), M. Beck, J. Borkowski on behalf of
the IBAS Localization Team, S. Shaw and N. Mowlavi on behalf of the
INTEGRAL Science Data Centre and the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

A 20 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on March 23 at 13:02:59 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-300 keV band. The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A. 13h 53m 52.7s
Dec. -52deg 21' 10''

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin.

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 1.7
photons/cmsq/s (2.2 x 10^-7 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).
