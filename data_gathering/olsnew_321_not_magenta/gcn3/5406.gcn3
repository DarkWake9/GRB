E. Rol (U of Leicester) reports on behalf of the RoboNet telescope
network:

We observed the field of GRB060805 (Ziaeepour et al, GCN Circular
5398) with the 2m Liverpool Telescope during the night of
2006-08-05/06, in Sloan r' and i' filters.  At the position of the
refined XRT position (Page et al, GCN Circular 5404), we do not detect
any source.  The observations and limiting magnitude are detailed
below. Calibration has been performed using the available SDSS data
(Cool et al, GCN Circular 5399).
