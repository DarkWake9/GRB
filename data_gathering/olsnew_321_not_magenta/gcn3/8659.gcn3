B. E. Cobb (UC Berkeley) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 081210
(Krimm et al. GCN 8648) with a mid-exposure time of ~6.2 hours
post-burst (2008-12-11 02:33 UT).  Total summed exposure
times amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The GRB's optical afterglow (Krimm et al. GCN 8648)
is not detected to an approximate limiting magnitude
of I>22.3 and J>20.0.  (Optical photometry is calibrated against
Landolt standard stars and IR photometry is calibrated
against 2MASS stars in the field.)
