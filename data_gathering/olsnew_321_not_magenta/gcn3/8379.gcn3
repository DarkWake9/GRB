P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT Team

We have obtained 2 ks of XRT Photon Counting mode data of GRB 081016 (Gotz 
et al. GCN Circ. 8377), beginning 20.4 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger. We 
find an uncatalogued X-ray source at RA,Dec, 255.57032, -23.33556 which is 
equvialent to:

RA (J2000.0):  17 02 16.88
Dec (J2000.0): -23:20:08.0

with an estimated uncertainty of 3.6" (radius, 90% confidence). This 
position is 21" from the INTEGRAL position, within the INTEGRAL error 
circle. It is not currently possible to determine whether this source is 
fading. Further observations are planned.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
