On behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

We observed the localization region of the neutrino event IceCube-210629A (Santander et. al, GCN 30342) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope, equipped with the 47 square degree ZTF camera (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019). We started observations in the g-band and r-band beginning at 2021-06-30 at 09:35 UT, approximately 15.4 hours after event time. We covered 4.6 sq deg, corresponding to 79.6% of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. Each exposure was 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag.
 
The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2021) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We are left with the following high-significance transient candidate, lying within the 90.0% localization of the skymap:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ZTF Name     | IAU Name  | RA (deg)    | DEC (deg)   | Filter | Mag   | MagErr |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ZTF21abecljv | AT2021osi | 341.4907741 | +12.1537928 | g      | 20.42 | 0.14   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

AT2021osi (ZTF21abecljv) is an unclassified transient first reported on 2021-06-04 by ALeRCE (FÃ¶rster et al. 2020). The position of this transient appears to be consistent with the nucleus of its host galaxy. Forced photometry shows no optical detections prior to 2021-05-06.

We encourage spectroscopic observations of this object to establish its nature.
