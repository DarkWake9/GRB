TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2445
SUBJECT: SN 2003jd (SN/GRB?) -- X-ray Observations

D. Watson, E. Pian (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Trieste), J. N. Reeves (GSFC),
J. Hjorth and K. Pedersen (University of Copenhagen) report:

A 25ks observation of the hypernova SN2003jd (IAUC 8232,8234) which has an
optical spectrum similar to the GRB-associated SNe 1998bw and 2003dh (GCN
2431, 2435) was performed with Chandra ACIS-S starting 18:47:44 UT Nov.
10.

No source is detected at the position of the supernova with a 3sigma
upper limit for the 0.3-2.0keV band of 5.7e-16 erg/cm^2/s.  At a distance
of 75 Mpc this implies an upper limit to the luminosity 3.8e38 erg/s.
This is at least 40 times fainter than SN1998bw at about 30 days after the
GRB or a factor of >4 fainter than SN1980K and consistent with the X-ray
flux from either SN 1994I or SN2002ap at a similar epoch.
