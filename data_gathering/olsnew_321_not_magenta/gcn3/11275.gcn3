D. Grupe, S.D. Barthelmy, and N. Gehrels report on behalf of the Swift  
team:

Using the data set from T-60 to T+240 s from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report that BAT trigger #433953 is not a GRB, nor is it  
astrophysical.
It is likely due to a chance coincidence of fluctuations in the rate and
image domains.
