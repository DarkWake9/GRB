N. Tanvir, R. Priddey (U. Hertfordshire) A. Levan (U. Leicester),
T. Geballe (Gemini) and T. Wold (JAC) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have obtained a 2nd epoch of K band imaging at UKIRT, 40 minutes
(again in ~0.6 arcsec seeing), starting at August 29.22 UT.

We confirm the findings of Kaplan and Berger (GCN Circular 2683),
that XMM-2 has faded by between 0.4 and 0.5 magnitudes, but similarly
caution that the photometry is quite sensitive to the chosen aperture
size (2.2 arcsec diameter was used) since the source is somewhat extended.

XMM-2 is therefore likely to be the GRB afterglow (+ host), and the
power-law decay slope a relatively shallow alpha~0.5, consistent with
a fairly significant host contribution to the measured magnitudes.

XMM-1 has remained constant at about K~19.8
