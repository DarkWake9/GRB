TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB011211: HST Observations of Optical Afterglow and Host Galaxy

D.W. Fox, J.S. Bloom, and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:  

"We have imaged the optical afterglow (GCN 1191) and presumed host
galaxy of GRB011211 (GCN 1215) with the Hubble Space Telescope and
STIS (Clear) instrument for 5133s on December 25.8 UT.  The host
galaxy is clearly detected and extends for roughly 0.5 arcsec
northeast of the afterglow.

Our observations confirm the result of Burud et al. (GCN 1213), with
the caveat that the afterglow offset is approximately 0.3 arcsec and
to the southwest rather than the southeast of the host galaxy.
