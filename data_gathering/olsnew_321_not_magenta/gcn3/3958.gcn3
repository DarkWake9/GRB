D. Allen, C. Rodgers, R. Canterna (U. of Wyoming) report on behalf of the
Red Buttes Observatory (0.6m) GRB Team as part of the FUN GRB
Collaboration.
We  responded to GRB 050908 (GCN 3942) at 08:01:52 UT with a 10 minute I
exposure centered on the position of the original Swift-BAT GRB Position
under 3.9 arcsecond differential conditions.  The source was not detected
in
the 10 minute I exposure in the same position reported by GCN 3943 (Torii
et al.) due to our detection limits.
