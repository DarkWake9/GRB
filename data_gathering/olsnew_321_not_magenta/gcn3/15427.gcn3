U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131030A detected by SWIFT 
(trigger 576238,Troja et al. GCN 15402) with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy.

The observations started 20h 11m. after the 
GRB trigger,with our schmidt telescope 
D=320 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added a series of 30 unfiltered CCD exposures of 120sec.


We detect a (fading) afterglow in the error box given by SWIFT.
at the following position (+/- 3 arcsec):

RA (J2000.0) =  23h 00m 16.12s
DEC(J2000.0) = -05d 22p 06.9s


The results of our photometry are:
