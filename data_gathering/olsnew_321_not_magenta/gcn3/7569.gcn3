report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained observations of GRB 080319B (GCN 7427) with HST/WFPC2 in
F606W and F814W filters on 2008 April 7th (2 orbits in each filter).

These data show the fading afterglow at magnitude F(814W_AB)=24.2
and F(606W_AB)=24.5.  This fading is consistent within
the errors with a continued power-law decline in optical
brightness.

PSF subtraction reveals no obvious sign of an underlying host galaxy,
although there is what appears to be a separate galaxy 1.5 arcsec to
the south, which might be producing one of the foreground absorption
systems (GCN 7451).

A colour image showing the field around the GRB is available at:

Further analysis is ongoing.
