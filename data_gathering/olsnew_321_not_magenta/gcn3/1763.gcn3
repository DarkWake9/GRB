TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1763
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021215 (large error box)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 15330 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 3 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 182.924, 36.123 degrees, whose radius is 82.118 +/-  0.017
degrees (3 sigma).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -50 and -30 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus south of RA, Decl= 109, -8 degrees and
206, -43 degrees.

It is not known at this point whether this event was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
