Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140916A (trigger #612804)
(Racusin, et al., GCN Circ. 16819).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 40.384, -39.688 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 41m 32.2s 
  Dec(J2000) = -39d 41' 18.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 16%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at T-3 sec, peaking 
at T+3 sec and ending at T+100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 80.1 +- 15.6 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.6 to T+89.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.15 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.80 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
