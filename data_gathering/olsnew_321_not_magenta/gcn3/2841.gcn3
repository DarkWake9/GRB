W. Li, A. V. Filippenko, R. Chornock, and S. Jha (University of 
California, Berkeley) report:

"The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT; see Li et al. 2003, 
PASP, 115, 844) at Lick Observatory robotically observed GRB 041211
(HETE Trigger #3622). One batch of 16 unfiltered images was taken
from 12:52:24 UT to 13:22:03 UT, covering a 12.6' x 12.6' field centered
on the WXM position R.A. = 06h43m53s, DEC = +20d 20'17" (J2000).
Another batch of 4 images was taken from 13:56:44 UT to 14:06:00 UT,
covering a 6.6' x 6.6' field centered on the revised WXM position 
R.A. = 06h43m27s, DEC = +20d 19'58" (J2000). We detected no new 
objects in our observations when compared to the DSS II images.
The following 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are derived (calibrated with 
USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes): R~17.1 mag for a 3 x 5s unfiltered grid image 
started at 12:52:24 UT (4837s after the burst), R~18.4 for a 60s
unfiltered image started at 12:59:20 UT (5253s after the burst)."
