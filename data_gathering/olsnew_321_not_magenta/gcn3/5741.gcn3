We observed  the  error box of GRB060904b (Grupe et al., GCN 5505)  with 1.5
m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory (MAO)  on September 4 and
5. A set of R images were taken under good weaher conditions.  The afterglow
(Rykoff  et al., GCN 5504; Grupe et al., GCN 5505) is clearly detected in
combined images of each epochs. A photometry of the afterglow based on USNO
A2.0 is following:

Mid time (UT), Exposure (s), R_ mag.,     Seeing
