SUBJECT: GRB 131014A: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

C. A. Swenson (PSU) and Alex Amaral-Rogers (U Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observations of the field of GRB 131014A
starting approximately 45.7 ks after the Fermi LAT detection (Desiante et
al. 2013, GCN 15333).  We do not detect any new source consistent
with the NOT afterglow candidate (Schulze et al. 2013, GCN 15337).

Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the summed
exposures are presented below.

----------------------------------------------------
Filter       TSTART      TSTOP    Exposure       Mag
----------------------------------------------------
     u        45,688     74,324        1239     >20.9
----------------------------------------------------

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
extinction due to the Galactic reddening along the line of sight to
this burst of E(B-V) = 0.22 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
