K.L. Page, A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and J.L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The description of the XRT light curve given in GCN Circ. 18059 was
incorrect. Following significant flaring activity during the first 1.3 ks
of data, the light curve from T0+4.7 ks to 24.0 ks remains approximately
constant with a mean count rate of 0.04 ct/sec (not 2.2 ct/sec as
previously stated). We apologise for any confusion.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
