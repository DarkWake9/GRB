C. Fletcher (USRA) and C.M. Hui (NASA/MSFC) report on behalf of the

Fermi-GBM team:

We have searched the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for a
gamma-ray counterpart to IceCube-190503A (The IceCube
Collaboration, GCN 24378). The neutrino position
(RA, Dec) = (120.28, 6.35) was Earth-occulted for Fermi-GBM from about
T0-650 s to T0+1500 s. We therefore cannot set any limits on
impulsive emission.
