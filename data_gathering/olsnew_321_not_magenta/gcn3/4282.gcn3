A. Beardmore, K. Page, M. Goad (U. Leicester), J Kennea (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the first orbit of XRT data from GRB051117B (Band et
al, GCN4281). We find a fading, uncatalogued source located at

RA(J2000)  =  05h 40m 43.0s
DEC(J2000) = -19d 16' 26.2"

with an estimated uncertainty of 3.9" (90% containment). This includes
the latest XRT boresight correction and is 3.14' from the BAT on-board
position.
