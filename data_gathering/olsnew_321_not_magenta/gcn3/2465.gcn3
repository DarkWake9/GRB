We have carried out optical observations of the field of INTEGRAL GRB
031203 using the P7 photometer's guiding Camera (6.5'x 6') mounted on
the Belgian MERCATOR 1.2-meter telescope located at La Palma Observatory
(Canary Islands), beginning at 03:44 UT on 2003 December 04 (5.7 hours
after the burst). We obtained four unfiltered images, with exposure
times of 180 and 480 s.
   
The comparison with the USNO-A2 catalog of the 2.5' error circle around
the position provided by INTEGRAL (GCN #2459) as well as the 6" ones
around the two positions provided by XMM NEWTON (GCN #2464) does not
reveal any new source down to a limiting magnitude of V < 17.6.
