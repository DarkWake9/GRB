NUMBER:  11088
SUBJECT: GRB 100814A: Swift UVOT observations of the optical afterglow

C. Gronwall (PSU) and C. J. Saxton (MSSL) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

In response to GRB 100814A (Swift/BAT trigger 431605) at 03:50:11 UT,
UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter  
starting
153 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in the
rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
RA(J2000) =	01:29:53.54 = 22.47309
DEC(J2000) = -17:59:43.5 = -17.99541
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.75 arc sec. This  
position is 4.7
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle.  This position  
supersedes
the position given in (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 11087) and is  
consistent
with the optical afterglow position from ROTSE (Schaefer et al., GCN  
Circ. 11086).
The estimated magnitude is 16.76 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.14.  
No correction
has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of  
0.02.
