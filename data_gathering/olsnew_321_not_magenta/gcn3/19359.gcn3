A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), K.L. Page and P.A. 
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the 
Fermi-detected burst GRB 160422A (Yassine et al., GCN Circ. 19329; Burns 
et al., GCN Circ. 19331), extending from T0+400 ks to T0+470 ks after 
the Fermi/GBM trigger.

At the position of the candidate afterglow reported by Maselli et al. 
(GCN Circ. 19334) no source is detected in the new observation, with a 
three sigma upper limit of 2.6e-3 ct/s. This confirms that it was the 
X-ray afterglow of GRB 160422A.

The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available 
at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020605
