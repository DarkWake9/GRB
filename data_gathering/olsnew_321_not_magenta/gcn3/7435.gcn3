on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have been monitoring the GRB 080319B optical afterglow (Racusin et
al. GCN 7427) using Mt. Lemmon 1m telescope with B, V, R, I and z'
band filter. The brightness at about 80 min after the burst is R~16.0
mag. derived from USNO-B1.0 catalog. Comparing with the further reports
by Li et al (GCN 7430), and Milen & Williams (GCN 7432), the light
curve shows shallower decay from around 0.05 days after the burst.

Further analysis and observations are in progress."
