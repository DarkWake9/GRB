E. O. Ofek, A. Gal-Yam, S. Kaspi, J. Dann, P. Ibbetson (Wise observatory,
TAU) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 020409 (Piro, GCN 1347)
using the Wise observatory 1m telescope equipped with the FOSC instrument.
We obtained 4 exposures of 360 s in R-band on 2002 Apr 10.717 UTC, 
20.0 hours after the burst.
Comparison of the combined image with the POSS-II E plate
reveals no candidate optical transients, to a limiting magnitude of R=19,
within the 4' BeppoSAX error circle.
