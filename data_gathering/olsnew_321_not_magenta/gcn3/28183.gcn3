The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:27:14 UT on 1 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200801A (trigger 617963239.0814 / 200801352).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 321.1, Dec = 85.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 24m, 85d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 73.0 degrees.
