report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 1372 observations of galaxies (from the
2MPZ catalogue) within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G275697,
using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap,
galaxy distances were taken into account in selecting which ones to
observe. The observations currently span from 15 ks to 256 ks after the
LVC trigger, and cover 165 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for
overlaps). This covers 0.16 of the probability in the LVC skymap, and
0.30 of the probability in the LVC map after convolving with the 2MPZ
galaxy catalogue, as described by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,  462,
1591).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected 6 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

Source 14 was originally reported (in a COUNTERPART) notice as a rank 3
source, as no X-ray counterpart exists in the catalogues searched
automatically. However, an object does exist in the latest 3XMM-DR6
release, which corresponds to source 14, so it has been re-classified
as a rank 4, known source.

Source 8 was also originally reported as rank 3 (LVC Circ. 20798),
however it corresponds to a SIMBAD source 3C 33.1, which is a Seyfert
1, and has been detected by Chandra, therefore this has also been
re-classified as rank 4.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 0 sources of rank 3
  * 6 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7


RANK 4 sources
==============

These are catalogued X-ray sources, showing no signs of outburst
compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.
  
  Source 9:
  =============
    RA: 	 331.2359 ( = 22h 04m 56.62s) J2000
    Dec:	 +47.2357 ( = +47d 14' 08.5") J2000
    Error:	 +5.5 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 1.5e-01 +/- 5.6e-02 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 6.6e-12 +/- 2.4e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
    Cat Source:  1SXPS J220456.4+471403 in the 1SXPS catalogue

    Cat Flux:	 2.5e-11 +/- 1.2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
       so the source is not above the catalogued flux.
    There is no evidence for fading.
    NOTE: this source is NOT within 200 kpc of a GWGC or 2MPZ galaxy
      which is consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW
object.

    There is 1 2MASS object within the source's 3-sigma error radius.
    NOTE: This source is affected by optical loading. The X-ray
detection appears real, but the flux may be inaccurate.

    Cat Flux:	 6.5e-12 +/- 4.7e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
       so the source is not above the catalogued flux.
    There is no evidence for fading.
    NOTE: this source is NOT within 200 kpc of a GWGC or 2MPZ galaxy
      which is consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW
