T. V. Kryachko (Astrotel Observatory, KSU/AST), D. V. Denisenko (IKI) 
and B. L. Satovskiy (Astrotel) report:

We have observed the field of SGR 0501+4516 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 8113; 
ATel 1676) remotely with 30-cm Astrotel-Caucasus telescope from Aug. 23, 
21:08:46 UT to Aug. 24, 01:21:52 UT.  In total, forty-five 300-sec 
exposures were obtained.  The first image taken at large zenith distance 
(69 deg) and with the last-quarter Moon only 26 deg away serendipitously 
covered an interval of burst activity from SGR 0501+4516.  Four BAT 
triggers occurred during these five minutes (Palmer, ATel 1678).  No 
object was found in our image inside the XRT error box or at the 
position of possible UKIRT nIR counterpart (Tanvir and Varricatt, GCN 
8126) to the limiting magnitude of R=19.0.  Comparison with the next 
image did not show any significant brightening of the variable star 
mentioned in GCN 8114.

The analysis of full data set is underway.  Future observations of the 
field with Astrotel-Caucasus are planned.
