M. Uemura, A. Arai, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.), 
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We took optical and IR images of the field of GRB070419A (GCN 6302) at 
11:01-11:12 UT 19 Apr. using TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 
1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan.  
We obtained 10 sets of V, J, and Ks-band images with a 63, 60, 
and 48-s exposure times under thin clouds.  

No new object was significantly detected in the combined image 
(19.46322 Apr. 2007 UT).  Limit magnitudes are 20.0, 17.2, and 15.0 mag
in V-, J-, and Ks-band, respectively, using the USNO A2.0 and 
2MASS catalog.
