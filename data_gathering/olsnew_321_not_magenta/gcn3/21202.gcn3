S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester),
and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift team:

We report further analysis of the Swift/BAT trigger #755873 (Page et al.,
GCN Circ. 21193) using data from the recent telemetry downlink.

The BAT ground analysis uses the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec.
The BAT image significance is only 1.9 sigma. Also, the mask-weighted
light curve does not show anything significant.

XRT collected 4.5 ks of Photon Counting mode data between 134 s and 13.1
ks after the BAT trigger. No X-ray was detected within the 90% BAT error
circle, to an 3-sigma upper limit of 3.1x10^-3 count s^-1.

We therefore conclude that this trigger is due to noise fluctuation.

The results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at
