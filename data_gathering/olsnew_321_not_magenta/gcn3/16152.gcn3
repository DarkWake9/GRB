A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:32:38.54 UT on 23 April 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140423A (trigger 419934761 / 140423356)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Sonbas et al. 2014, GCN 16142)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multiple-peak structure 
with a duration (T90) of about 95 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-61.440 s to T0+32.768 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 125 +/- 9 keV,
alpha = -0.25 +/- 0.11, and beta = -1.97 +/- 0.06. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.0 +/-0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.44 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.0 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
