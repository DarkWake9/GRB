Veli-Pekka Hentunen, Markku Nissinen and Tuomo Salmi (Taurus Hill
Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

We have detected GRB 160131A optical afterglow at iTelescope observatory
(Siding Spring, Australia) using T9  0.32-m f/9 RCOS telescope and T17 and 
T32  0.43-m f/6.8 astrographs. The observations were started at 2016-01-31 
10:01:17 (UT). Several images using photometric R and V filters with 300 sec
and 120 sec exposure time were taken.

The afterglow was detected at the position RA 05:12:40.34 and DEC
-07:02:58.3.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using
NOMAD1 0829-0078536 (R=15.390 and V=14.820) as a comparison star:
