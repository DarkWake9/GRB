Milvang-Jensen (DARK), P. Jakobsson (U. Hertfordshire), A.O. Jaunsen
(U. Oslo) and C. Ledoux (ESO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 080319B (Racusin et al., GCN
7427) with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES)
mounted at ESO's VLT Kueyen. Observations were performed in
rapid-response mode starting on 2008 March 19 at 07:18 UT.

The highest redshift system that we identify based on the MgII doublet
and various other features has z=0.937, the presumed redshift of GRB
080319B. Another system is identified at z=0.530.

We acknowledge excellent support from the observing staff at Paranal,
in particular Swetlana Hubrig and Elena Mason.
