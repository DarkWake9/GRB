"We have imaged the field of GRB 070610 (Pagani et al.
GCNC 6489) with the 1.5m OSN telescope in Granada
(Spain) using V, R and I filters. The observations were
obtained starting at 02:44:55 UT (5.87 hours after the
burst). Inside the XRT error box (Pagani et al. 6490) we
detect the afterglow reported by Stefanescu et al.
(GCNC 6492) with R~21.5 at the following coordinates
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec:

A.R.: 19:55:09.63
Dec.: +26:14:05.6
