David Bersier (LJMU), Drejc Kopac (Ljubljana) report

The Liverpool Telescope (La Palma) started robotic observations of GRB
120805A 3 minutes after detection by Swift (Troja et al, GCN 13588). We
find no credible afterglow candidate in the XRT error circle. We find
upper limits of 18.9 in the r band 30 minutes after burst and 18.7 in the
i band 47 minutes after burst.
