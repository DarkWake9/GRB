SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), RHESSI, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)
observed this ~10 s long event at 20344 s.  We have triangulated it to a
preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)= 1.486, +0.348 degrees,
whose radius is 53.410 +/- 0.038 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the
Konus ecliptic latitude response limits the arrival directions to a
band between ecliptic latitudes -32 and -24 degrees, and RHESSI
Earth-blocking eliminates one possible intersection of this band with
the annulus.  The remaining error box is that section of the annulus
between RA, Decl=323, -40 degrees and 331.5, -46.1 degrees.  This
localization may be improved, but a small error box cannot be derived
for this event.
