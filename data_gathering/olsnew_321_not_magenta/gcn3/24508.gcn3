The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are switched off around the perigee passage, every 2.6 days,
to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time
of the LIGO/Virgo trigger S190512at (2019-05-12 18:07:14.422 UTC) the
spacecraft was preparing to start the observations after the perigee
passage between the orbits number 2089 and 2090 and no
scientific instrument data are available. INTEGRAL observations will
restart at approximately 2019-05-13 03:08:07 UTC.
