Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210205A (trigger #1030629)
(Dichiara et al., GCN Circ. 29397).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 347.264, 56.311 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 09m 03.3s
   Dec(J2000) = +56d 18' 41.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 18%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that
starts at ~ T-7 s and ends at ~T+20 s. The main peak in the structure
occurs at ~T+6 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 22.70 +- 4.18 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.35 to T+20.07 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.27 +- 0.31.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
8.7 +- 1.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+5.98 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
