We observed the field of GRB 130603B (Melandri, et al., GCN 14735) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;www.ratir.org 
<http://www.ratir.org>) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/06 4.16 to 2013/06 4.27 UTC (12.01
to 14.78 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.93 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.81 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

At the location of the optical afterglow (Levan et al., GCN 14742),
in comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

    r'    20.78 +/- 0.03
    i'    20.52 +/- 0.03
    Z    20.20 +/- 0.05
    Y    19.94 +/- 0.05
    J     19.97 +/- 0.06
    H    19.55 +/- 0.06

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
Photometry was performed adopting a large aperture which includes both the
afterglow and its host galaxy.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
