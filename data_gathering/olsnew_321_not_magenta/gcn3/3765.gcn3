We imaged the field of GRB050802 (GCN 3734, Band et al.) with the 3.5 m
Italian National Telescope (TNG) (Canary Islands). Observations were
carried out with the optical spectrograph Dolores on August 2.9 UT in 5
filters (U, B, V, R, I) and on August 3.9 UT in 2 filters (V, I).

In all images we detect an object at the position reported by McGowen
et al. (GCN 3739).  Therefore, the detected object is identified as the
afterglow candidate reported in GCN 3739. Preliminary photometry shows
the object fading from V~21.1 to V~22.8 and from I~20.5 to I~21.9
between the two epochs.
We note also an extended fainter object near the afterglow in the V
frame obtained on August 3. This object is at the same position as can
be seen in the image linked in GCN 3756, that Fynbo et al. propose as
suspected host galaxy.  Further refined analysis is ongoing.
