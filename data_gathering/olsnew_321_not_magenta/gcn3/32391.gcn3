K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) report on behalf
of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 05:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible GRB 220714A (trigger=1116172). Swift slewed immediately. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec  which is 171.904, -59.342
  RA(J2000)  =  11h 27m 37s
  Dec(J2000) = -59d 20' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). 

No source was detected in 270 s of promptly downlinked data. We are
waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the XRT
counterpart. 

Some of the TDRSS notices, including all of the BAT notices, have been
lost, so we have no prompt information about the possible GRB
light-curve or duration. Therefore, such information will only be
available when the data have been dumped to the ground around 09 UT. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Laha (sib.laha AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
