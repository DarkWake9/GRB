K. L. Page (U Leicester) and R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 12:23:03 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140211A (trigger=586289).  Swift did not slew due to a 
Moon constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 124.230, +20.244 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 16m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = +20d 14' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a broad
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 20:04 UT on 2014 February 14. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. R. Cummings (jayc AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
