The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 23:38:28 UT on 5 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190905A (trigger 589419513.488626 / 190905985).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 234.5, Dec = 3.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 37m, 3d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 97.0 degrees.
