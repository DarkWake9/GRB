The long GRB 200125A (Swift-BAT trigger #952164:
Lien et al., GCN 26876; Markwardt et al., GCN 26897)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows three emission pulses
in the interval from ~T0(BAT)-35 s to ~T0(BAT)+315 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB200125A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
2.04(-0.16,+0.22)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+287.4 s, of 2.80(-0.58,+0.62)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

The K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0(BAT)-33.5 s to ~T0(BAT)+316.8 s)
is best described by simple power-law model
with photon index of -2.14(-0.09,+0.1), chi2=0.08/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
