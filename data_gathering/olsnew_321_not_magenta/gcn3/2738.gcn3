At 5h 21m  after  HETE alert 3564   MASTER robotic telescope
(http://observ.pereplet.ru) had imaging  the corresponding area of the
sky under the large zenit distance (GCN 2737).
The first image was started at 17h13m34s UT.

Now we have 50 unfiltered images of the error box (45s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin, 200 mm camera).

Ther is no optical transient up to 18.5 m at position
given Fox and Moon (GCN2734).
Our unfiltered magnitude is close to R filter.
So, we conclude that OT proposed by Fox and Moon can be real optical
emission from GRB040929.
