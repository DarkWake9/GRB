At 01:47:34 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130327A (trigger=552063).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 91.992, +55.730 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 07m 58s
   Dec(J2000) = +55d 43' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a weak single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 01:49:55.0 UT, 141.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 92.0387, 55.7143 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 06h 08m 09.29s
   Dec(J2000) = +55d 42' 51.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 110 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.31
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 104 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically
complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.13.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
