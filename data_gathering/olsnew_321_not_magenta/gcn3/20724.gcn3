The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

The Coherent WaveBurst event candidate of 2017-02-17, with GraceDB ID
G274296, was initially reported (LSC and Virgo, GCN 20689) with an
estimated false alarm rate (FAR) of 1.7e-7 Hz, or about 5.4 per year.
Offline re-analysis has not changed this estimate.  At this time, we
do not have any evidence suggesting that the significance of this
event will increase on further study.  Also, the (potential) signal
in the data is inconsistent with a compact binary
coalescence waveform.
