P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Magazzu` (INAF-TNG), Albar G. de Gurtubai 
(INAF-TNG), L. A. Antonelli (INAF-OAR) report on behalf of the MISTICI 
and CIBO collaborations:

We observed the field of GRB 070219 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 6104) with the 
Italian TNG telescope sited in La Palma, Canary Islands. Observations 
were carried out about 2.02
hours after the burst. No object is present inside the XRT error box 
(Sakamoto et al., GCN 6104) down to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 25 
(3sigma level, calibrated against the USNOB1 catalog).

We acknowledge the support of the TNG staff.
