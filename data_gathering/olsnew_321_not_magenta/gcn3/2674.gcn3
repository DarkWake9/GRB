B. Monard (Bronberg Obs., bmonard@mweb.co.za) reports on behalf
of the AAVSO International GRB network:

Observations of the INTEGRAL error circle for GRB040827
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 2670, 2671, 2672)
were made with the Bronberg 0.30m telescope + unfiltered CCD.
Twenty-five 13-second exposures with UT midpoint of 040827.701
(5.0hrs after the burst) were stacked, with a limiting magnitude
of 20.0CR (based on USNO-A red magnitudes).  No new object
is seen in a 15x15arcmin region centered on the INTEGRAL
coordinates down to approximately CR=19.5 when comparing against
a DSS2-red image.

  The AAVSO International GRB network is greatful for a generous grant from
the Curry Foundation and to NASA for the financial support for the High
Energy Workshops for Amateur Astronomers.
