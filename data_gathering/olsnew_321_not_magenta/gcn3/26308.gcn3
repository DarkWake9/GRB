on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S191129u at T0 = 2019-11-29 13:40:29
UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that the 
Gamma-Ray
Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less than 10% of the 90% c.l. 
localization
region (LR) (36% of 90% c.l. localization region (LR) is occulted by 
Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV between T0 and T0+100s, where good exposure of the S191129u 90% 
c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are 
obtained:

from 3.4e-08 to 2.9e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 46% of 
the LR over
the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode.
