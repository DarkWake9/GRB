"The 0.30m robotic telescope FRAM located in Malargue,
Argentina, observed the reported location of GRB 151029A
(Ukwatta GCNC 18522) starting 884s after the corrected
trigger time (Barthelmy GCNC 18535), 8.9s after receiving
the trigger.

The telescope obtained a 30 minute set of unfiltered
exposures. The optical afterglow (Oates GCNC 18531,
Knust GCNC 18523, Tanvir GCNC 18524) can be detected
on combined exposures.

In the first combined image, with the mean time of individual
exposures 08:07:27 UT (1068s post trigger), we measure
magnitude 17.7 +/- 0.2. The calibration was done with three
nearby USNO-B2.0 stars."
