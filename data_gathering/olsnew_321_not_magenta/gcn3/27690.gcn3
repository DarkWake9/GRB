The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:28:41 UT on 6 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200506A (trigger 610417726.052718 / 200506020).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 271.7, Dec = -4.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 06m, -4d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 87.0 degrees.
