of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 100814A (Swift-BAT trigger=431605;
Beardmore et al., GCN 11087; Krimm et al., GCN 11094)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=13811.288s UT (03:50:11.288)

The burst light curve consists of several pulses
with a total duration of ~150 s.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB100814_T13811/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.2 +/- 0.2)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+1.024s
of (0.75 +/- 0.25)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+155.904 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.4(-0.3, +0.4),
and Ep = 128(-17, +23) keV (chi2 = 59/58 dof).

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.848 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = 0.55 +/- 0.30,
and Ep = 147(-10, +12) keV (chi2 = 55/58 dof).

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
