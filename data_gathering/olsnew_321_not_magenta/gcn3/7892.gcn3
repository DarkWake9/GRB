on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:50:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an automated trigger (314975).  Swift did not slew because
of an Earth limb constraint (for 38 minutes). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 234.222, -73.269, which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 36m 53s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 16' 09"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows nothing obvious for
this rate trigger.  The lightcurve is consistant with noise. 
Because of the Earth limb constraint, we will not have NFI observations
until T+38 minutes.  And because we are in the Malindi downlink gap,
we will not receive the full data set until T+9 hrs. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Immler (immler AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
