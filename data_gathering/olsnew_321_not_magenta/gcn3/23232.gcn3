E. Bissaldi (Politecnico & INFN Bari) and F. Longo (Univ & INFN Trieste)
report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:


At 18:23:02 UT on September 14, 2018 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission
from GRB 180914B, which was also detected by AGILE/MCAL (Ursi et al., GCN #23226)
and by AGILE/GRID (Verrecchia et al., GCN #23231).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 332.45, 24.88 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.33 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only).
This was 94 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.
The Fermi-LAT position is consistent with the AGILE/GRID one.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
that is spatially correlated with the trigger with high significance.
The highest-energy photon is a 12.6 GeV event
which is observed 1662 s after the AGILE trigger.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elisabetta Bissaldi (elisabetta.bissaldi@ba.infn.it).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to
cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration
between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
