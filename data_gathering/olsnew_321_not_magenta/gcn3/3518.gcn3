T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The long bright multipeak GRB 050603
(Swift-BAT trigger=131560: GCN 3509, 3512)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=23340.767 s UT (06:29:00.767).
As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~6 s,
fluence (3.41 ± 0.06)10-5 erg/cm2,
peak flux on 16-ms time scale (3.2 ± 0.2)10-5  erg/cm2 s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).
A weak decaying tail after the last, brigtest spike
of the GRB is seen up to ~11 s after T0
(this tail was seen and repoted by Swift-BAT in GCN 3512).


The time-integrated spectrum is well fitted by a GRB (Band) model:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.79 ± 0.06,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.15 ± 0.09,
the break energy E0 = 289 ± 36 keV,
and the peak energy Ep = 349 ± 28 keV.
