K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 180626C was detected by
Fermi (GBM; trigger 551697835), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind,
and Swift (BAT), at about 33831 s UT (09:23:51).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   278.579 (18h 34m 19s) +47.241 (+47d 14' 28")
  Corners:
   290.010 (19h 20m 02s) +48.528 (+48d 31' 40")
   290.186 (19h 20m 45s) +48.912 (+48d 54' 42")
   265.423 (17h 41m 42s) +43.214 (+43d 12' 49")
   264.736 (17h 38m 57s) +42.455 (+42d 27' 17")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 6.85 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 18.81 deg (the minimum one is 22 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 106 deg.

This box may be improved.

The localization of this burst is inconsistent with that of the short 
burst GRB 180626B, reported in GCN Circ. 22863.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
