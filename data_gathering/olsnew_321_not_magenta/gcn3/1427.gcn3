D.W. Fox and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech), with P. Weissman (JPL) report:

"We have observed the error region of the short/hard gamma-ray burst
GRB020531 (GCN 1407) with the Hale Telescope and Large Format Camera
on Mt. Palomar on two occasions, June 1.3 and June 2.3 UT, for a total
integration of 1200s at each epoch.

Within less than 1" of the position of Chandra Source 48 of Butler et
al. (GCN 1415, 1426), aka CXOU J151455.8-192454, we find an object
with r'~22.4 mag that appears slightly extended in our (FWHM ~ 1.4")
images, and varies less than 0.1 mag between our two epochs.  We
tentatively identify this object as the host galaxy of GRB020531.

Images will be posted shortly at
