JAGWAR team

We have initiated deep L band (1-2 GHz) multi-epoch observations of the 
50% containment region (5 sq deg; GCN 25333) of the GW event S190814bv 
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. A total of 28 pointings 
(coordinates given below), observed as part of the JAGWAR program, will 
achieve a uniform RMS noise between 10-15 uJy over the 5 sq deg region. 
Additional pointings to cover cataloged high-mass and high-SFR galaxies 
are planned, and will be announced later. We will report any radio 
transients found through the GCN system. Observations of this region 
with other telescopes is encouraged.
