The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-220425A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/31944.gcn3)
in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2022-04-25 02:36:37.820 UTC to 2022-04-25 02:53:17.820 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event  that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-220425A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220425A ranges from 1.2e+00 to 2.2e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination
with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 5e+02 GeV and 1e+06 GeV.

A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2022-04-24 02:44:57.820 UTC to 2022-04-26 02:44:57.820 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 1.00, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220425A ranges from 1.1e+00 to 2.3e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can
