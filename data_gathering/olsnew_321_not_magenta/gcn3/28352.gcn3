The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:42:40 UT on 3 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200903B (trigger 620793765.87189 / 200903113).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 53.9, Dec = -13.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 35m, -13d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
