Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
optically bright GRB 080721 (GCN 7988) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz
on 2008 July 24.15 UT. The GRB radio afterglow is undetected and
the peak radio flux at the UVOT afterglow position (GCN 7988) is
93 ± 48 uJy.
