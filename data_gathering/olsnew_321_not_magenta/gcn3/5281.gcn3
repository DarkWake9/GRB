GRB 060614: Detection of a Possible, Late-Time Rebrightening

S. T. Holland (NASA/GSFC & USRA) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT
team:

      We report the possible detection of a source at the location of
the optical afterglow of GRB 060614((Parsons et al., 2006, GCN
Circular 5252) at approximately 9.5 days after the BAT trigger.  The
putative source has a U-band magnitude of U = 22.8 +/- 0.3 (1-sigma
error) and was detected in coadded exposures taken between 7.4 and 12.4
days after the burst.  This is a 4.2-sigma detection.  Our detection
is approximately 3 mag brighter than the power-law extrapolation of
the early-time U-band decay predicts.  We are not able to determine
if this source is a rebrightening of the afterglow of GRB 060614 or
a detection of the host galaxy (Fynbo et al., 2006, GCN Circular 5277).

     The value quoted above is not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction of E_{B-V} = 0.02 (Schlegel et al. 1998).
