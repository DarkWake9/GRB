Updated Astrometry for the IR Counterpart of GRB990705


E. Palazzi, N. Masetti, and E. Pian (ITESRE-CNR, Bologna) report: 

"We have carefully checked the astrometry of the NTT+SOFI image taken on
July 5.94 UT (Palazzi et al. GCN # 377), and have found that the correct
coordinates of the IR transient are

RA (2000) = 05 09 54.5, 
Dec (2000) = -72 07 53

The astrometric uncertainty is 0".5.

The NTT+SOFI images relative to the IR transient detection (GCN # 377) can
be viewed at
