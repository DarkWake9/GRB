T. Giblin and R. M. Kippen (UAH/MSFC) report on behalf of the BATSE
GRB Team:

On 2000 January 15.61773 UT, BATSE was triggered by the bright
GRB000115 (Trigger# 7954). The time history of the burst is
significantly variable with a series of well-defined pulses over a
broad range of intensities. The pulse emission is followed by a soft
(<300 keV) and weak emission tail with a decay time of approximately
20 seconds. The measured T50 and T90 durations are 4.5 (+/- 0.09) and
15.0 (+/- 0.14) seconds, respectively.

The brightest peak of the burst and several weaker pulses show
emission above 300 keV. The energy fluence hardness ratio (100-300 keV
/ 50-100 keV) is 3.18 (+/- 0.02), typical for long bursts. The 50-300
keV peak flux measured on the 64 ms timescale is 56.96 (+/- 0.81)
photons/s/cm^2, placing it in the top 1% of the BATSE peak flux
distribution. The fluence above 25 keV is 4.36 (+/- 0.07) x 10^-5
ergs/cm^2, placing it in the top 10% of the BATSE fluence distribution.  
The BATSE location is consistent with the x-ray afterglow detected by
RXTE/PCA (GCN 519) and with the IPN annulus (GCN 520-521). The BATSE 
light curve and skymap are now available at:
