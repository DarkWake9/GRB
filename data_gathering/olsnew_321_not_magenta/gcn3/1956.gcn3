At 21:56:57.60 UTC (79017.60 s UT) on 23 Mar 2003, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2460, a faint, long GRB.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a localization which was
reported in a GCN Notice at 02:55:11 UT on 24 Mar, about 5 hours after
the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 6.  The WXM localization can
be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 18 arcminutes in radius
and is centered at

WXM:   RA = +11h 06m 54s, Dec = -21d 51' 00" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a more accurate
location which was reported in a GCN Notice at 05:28:51 UT on 24 Mar,
about 7 1/2 hours after the burst.  The SXC localization can be
expressed as a 90% confidence trapezoid, whose base and top are 24.5
and 11 arcminutes, whose height is 4 arcminutes, and whose area is 71
square arcminutes.  The center of the trapezoid lies at

RA = +11h 06m 06s, Dec = -21d 54' 20"  (J2000),

and its corners lie at

RA = +11h 05m 59.0s, Dec = -21d 48' 43"
RA = +11h 05m 56.6s, Dec = -21d 59' 46"
RA = +11h 06m 12.5s, Dec = -22d 06' 43"
RA = +11h 06m 17.8s, Dec = -21d 42" 11"  (J2000).

The SXC localization is trapezoidal because its sides are defined by
the WXM error circle.

The t_90 duration of the burst in the 30-400 keV band was 26 s. The
fluence of the burst was 1.1 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and the peak flux in 1.2
sec was ~1.2 x 10-9 ergs cm-2 s-1 (i.e., ~ 0.05 x Crab flux) in the
same energy band.
