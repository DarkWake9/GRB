report on behalf of the GRACE collaboration:

"We have observed the field of XRF 030723 (=HETE trigger 2777,
GCN 2320) with the FORS1 optical camera on the ESO VLT on 
September 24. In a deep (about 1 hr) R-band image with a mean 
seeing of 0.68 arcsec we detect a very faint, extended source
at the position of the optical afterglow (GCN 2323). The
galaxy has a position angle of about 90 degrees EofN. We 
interpret this as the likely host galaxy of XRF 030723. The 
magnitude of the galaxy is about R=26.8+/-0.4. An image of the
galaxy can be seen at:

We acknowledge excellent support from the Paranal staff, in 
particular Poshak Gandhi."
