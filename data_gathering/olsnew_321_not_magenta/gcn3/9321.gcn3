"We used the Max-Planck-Millimeter Bolometer (MAMBO-2) array at the
IRAM 30-m telescope to observe the field of view toward the host
galaxy of GRB 080913 (GCN 8217) at redshift z=6.7 (GCN 8225), RA
04:22:54.74, Dec -25:07:46.2 (J2000) at 250 GHz. Observations were
carried out for 3.7 hr between 2008 November 13 and 15.  We obtained a
non-detection of

    S_nu(250 GHz,1.20 mm) = 0.34 +/- 0.45 mJy

(1 sigma error), i.e. a 3 sigma upper flux density limit of 1.35 mJy
on the dust continuum in the GRB host galaxy at 1.2 mm (rest-frame 156
um). The 117-element MAMBO-2 bolometer detectors cover 210-290 GHz
(half power). The bolometers have a FWHM beam size of 10.7 arcsec, at
a pixel spacing of 20 arcsec. Observations were carried out in ON-OFF
observing mode under good weather conditions. Calibrations were
performed on J0348-278 and J0609-157.

We acknowledge the excellent support of the staff at IRAM. IRAM is
