K. Antonyuk, V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the error box of  GRB070917  (Cummings  et al., GCN 6743) with 
AZT-11 telescope of CrAO on Sep. 17.  Series of images were obtained between 
(UT) 2007-09-17 18:58:08 and 19:25:37 in R filter. In a combined image of 
6x300 s within the XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 6796) we do not 
detect any new sources in comparison with DSS2 up to the limiting magnitude 
(3 sigma) R=21.1. Photometry calibration is performed against USNO-A2.0. The 
combined image can be found in
