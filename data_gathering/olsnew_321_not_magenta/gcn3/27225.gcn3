on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

Konus-Wind (KW) was observing the whole sky at the time of the
LIGO/Virgo event S200219ac (2020-02-19 09:44:15.195 UTC, hereafter T0;
LIGO/Virgo Collaboration GCN Circ. 27130).

No triggered KW GRBs happened between ~2 hours before and ~10 minutes
after T0. The burst localizations are inconsistent with the S200219ac.
Using waiting-mode data within the interval T0 +/- 100 s,
we found no significant (> 5 sigma) excess over the background
in both KW detectors on temporal scales from 2.944 s to 100 s.

We estimate an upper limit (90% conf.) on the 20 - 1500 keV fluence
to 1.0x10^-6 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 2.944 s and having a
typical KW short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with
alpha =-0.5 and Ep=500 keV). For a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band
function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the corresponding
limiting peak flux is 2.4x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (20 - 1500 keV, 2.944 s 
scale).

All the quoted values are preliminary.
