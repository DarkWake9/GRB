The extremely bright, long GRB 180720B (Swift-BAT trigger #848890:
Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 22973, Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ. 22998;
Fermi-LAT detection: Bissaldi and Racusin, GCN Circ. 22980;
Fermi-GBM observation: Roberts and Meegan, GCN Circ. 22981;
MAXI/GGS detection: Negoro et al., GCN Circ. 22993;
Konus-Wind observation: Frederiks et al., GCN Circ. 23011)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 14:21:40.948 UTC on 20 July 2018.  Because of a problem in
one of the ground alert processing script, the GCN notice was not
distributed automatically for this event.  The burst signal was seen
by all CGBM detectors.

The CGBM data cover the time interval from T-243 sec to T+1449 sec
(when the HV was on and the source was in the CGBM FoV).

The burst light curve shows the main emission episode comprised
of several bright overlapped pulses which starts
at T-2.9 sec, peaks at 15.3 sec, and ends at T+54.0 sec,
followed by the weak tail seen at least up to T+120.1 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
51.1 +- 3.0 sec and 15.4 +- 1.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

No any precursor is seen in the time interval from T-243 sec to T-2.9 sec.

The time-averaged spectrum of the main episode (measured by the SGM
from T+0.8 sec to T+52.8 sec) is best fit in the 30 keV - 20 MeV range
by a GRB (Band) model with alpha = -1.29 +- 0.04,
Epeak =  686(-77, +88) keV, and beta = -2.23(-0.12, +0.09)
(chi2 = 254.4/236 dof).  The emission is seen up to ~20 MeV.
The resulting fluence in the 30 keV - 10 MeV range is
5.79(-0.19, +0.20)x10^-4 erg/cm2 .

Assuming a redshift of z=0.654 (Vreeswijk et al., GCN 22996)
and a FlatLambdaCDM cosmology with H0=68 km/s/Mpc and Omega_M=0.308
(Planck Collaboration 2016, A&A, 594, A13 (Paper XIII)),
the isotropic energy release, Eiso, is 6.82(-0.22, 0.24)x10^53 erg.

The quoted errors are at the 90% CL.
