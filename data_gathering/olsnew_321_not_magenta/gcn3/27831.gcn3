The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:27:24 UT on 28 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200528A (trigger 612354449.346938 / 200528436).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 169.2, Dec = 60.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 16m, 60d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
