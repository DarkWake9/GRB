We observed the field of GRB 190202A (Lien et al., GCNC 23830) with the 
2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) located at the Indian Astronomical 
Observatory, Hanle, India on 2019-02-02 (21:32:29 UT). Two frames in 
Bessell R and I-bands with an exposure time of 300 sec each were 
obtained. The OT candidate (Novichonok et al., GCNC 23831; Steeghs et 
al., GCNC 23833; Cucchiara, GCNC 23839; Paek et al., GCNC 23841; 
Malesani et al., GCNC 23842; Belkin et al., 23843; Moskvitin & 
Spiridonova, GCNC 23844) is clearly detected in both frames at the Swift 
UVOT coordinates (Kuin & Lien, GCNC 23834). The preliminary magnitudes 
calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 catalogue are following:

       UT-mid          Band           Mag
-------------------  ------    --------------
2019-02-02 21:34:59    R       20.66 +/- 0.17
2019-02-02 21:40:56    I       20.08 +/- 0.20

We thank the observing staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the 
observations.
