Konus-A teams report:

The GRB 071117 (Swift-BAT trigger #296805:
Ukwatta et al., GCN 7098; Krimm et al., GCN 7102) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=53404.535 s UT (14:50:04.535).
This burst also triggered Konus-A at T0=53408.587 s UT (14:50:08.587).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse with a 
duration of ~5 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 5.84(-2.40, +0.30)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.160 s
of 6.66(-2.95, +1.13)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).
The burst shows strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution.

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 1.53(-0.16, +0.15)
and Ep = 278 (-79, +236) keV (chi2 = 37.5/52 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
