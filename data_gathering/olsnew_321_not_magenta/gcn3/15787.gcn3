TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  15787
SUBJECT: GRB 140206A: Swift/UVOT optical detection
DATE:    14/02/06 11:03:15 GMT
FROM:    Samantha Oates at MSSL  <sro@mssl.ucl.ac.uk>

S. R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) and A. Y. Lien (NASA/GSFC/ORAU) report on behalf 
of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 54 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the finding chart image:

     RA (J2000)   9:41:20.24 = 145.33433 
    Dec (J2000)  +66:45:38.5 = 66.76069  

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). 
This position is consistent with the XRT position (Lien et al., GCN 15784) 
and the optical afterglow position reported by Oksanen et al (GCN 15786). 
The estimated magnitude is 15.76 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.03. 
No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding 
to E(B-V) of 0.12.
