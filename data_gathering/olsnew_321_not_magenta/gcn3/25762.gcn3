The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:10:14 UT on 16 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190916A (trigger 590335819.554478 / 190916590).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 321.3, Dec = -48.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 25m, -48d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 117.0 degrees.
