report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:47:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081016B (trigger=331856).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 14.615, -43.543 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 58m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = -43d 32' 34"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 19:48:45.1 UT, 90.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued, 
fading X-ray source located at RA, Dec 14.5670, -43.5296 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 58m 16.08s
   Dec(J2000) = -43d 31' 46.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.3 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 134 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
1.96e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 93 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the XRT error circle. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.01. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (kpa AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
