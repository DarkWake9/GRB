K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Incorrect coordinates for the X-ray afterglow of GRB 210928A were
accidentally reported in GCN 30915. The correct position (as earlier
stated in ATel 14945) is:

RA, Dec(J2000) = 245.81275, -17.87598, which is equivalent to

RA(J2000) = 16h 23m 15.06s
Dec(J2000) = -17d 52m 33.5s
with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 2.9 arcsec.

The information provided regarding the light-curve and spectrum were for
the afterglow; only the position was incorrect.

We apologise for any confusion.
