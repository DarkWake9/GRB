I.A. Smith (Rice U.), D.A. Perley (LJMU), and N.R. Tanvir 
(U. of Leicester) report:

We observed the Swift UVOT location of GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo 
et al., GCN Circ. 30261) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter 
continuum camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  
Observations totaling 2.1 hours were obtained on UT 2021-06-20 and
2021-06-21 in average and poor weather conditions respectively.
No counterpart was detected in the individual or combined maps.
Combining all the data, the RMS background noise was 1.61 mJy/beam 
at 850 microns and 27.9 mJy/beam at 450 microns; the mid-point of 
the run was 1.07 days after the burst trigger.  

We thank Patrice Smith, Mark Rawlings, Harriet Parsons, and the 
JCMT staff for the prompt support of these observations that were 
taken under project M21AP020.
