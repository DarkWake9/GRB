The Long Wavelength Array (LWA1, located west of Socorro, New Mexico,
US) made beam-formed observations for 4 hours on April 25 following the
LVC_INITIAL notice S190425z (GCN 24168). Observations began at 09:02:43
UTC, about 2 minutes after the notice, which was ~45 minutes after the
detection.

The observations were centered at frequencies 25.85 MHz and 45.45 MHz,
each with a bandwidth of 19.6 MHz. The FWHM is 15.499 degrees at 25.85
MHz, and 6.648 degrees at 45.45 MHz.

The three beams were centered at RA 16.171h, Dec 22.831deg; RA
15.937h, Dec 26.110deg; RA 16.382h, Dec 19.313deg.

Data analysis is under way.
