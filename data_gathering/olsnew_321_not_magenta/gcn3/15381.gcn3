We observed the field of GRB 131024B (Krimm, et al., GCN 15371) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/10 25.41 to 2013/10 25.52 UTC (12.28
to 14.87 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.78 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.74 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS DR9 
and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r	> 23.68
  i	> 23.35
  Z	> 22.44
  Y	> 22.01
  J	> 21.75
  H	> 21.49

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
