J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), V. Terron (IAA-CSIC), P. Ferrero (IAC),
M. Jelinek (IAA-CSIC), P. Kubanek (IAA-CSIC  & U. Valencia),
M. Fernandez (IAA-CSIC), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 110625A (Page et al.,  GCN 12088)
with the 1.23m telescope of Calar Alto observatory. We obtained
45x60s I-band images on June 25.88457--25.93027 UT
(i.e, starting 5.32 min after the trigger).

In the co-added image, we detect a source at RA(J2000)=19:06:55.88,
DEC(J200)=06:45:19.4 (+/-0.5") which is consistent with the objects
reported by Im et al. (GCN 12095) and Filgas et al. (GCN 12096).
Using as photometric reference the USNO B1.0 star located at RA(J2000)
= 19:06:56.17, DEC(J2000)=06:44:25.9 with I=16.56, we derived a
preliminary magnitude of I=20.6 (Vega system) for the object
inside the XRT error circle.

This magnitude might indicate some degree of fading with respect
to the i-band AB mag reported by Filgas et al. (GCN 12096).
However, we are still cautious on the possible association
of this object with the GRB.

Further multi-band observations are encouraged."
