P.A. Evans & B.P. Gompertz (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT performed a second observation of GRB 131031A (Cummings, GCN 
15421) on 2013 Nov 5, for 4.7 ks. The XRT source reported by Gompertz & 
Page (GCN 15424) is undetected, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 2.5e-3 
ct/sec, well below the level of the previous detection. We therefore 
conclude that this was the afterglow of GRB 131031A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
