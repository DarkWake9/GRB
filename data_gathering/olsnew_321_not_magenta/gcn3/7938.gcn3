Using the data set from T-120 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080703 (trigger #315819)
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN Circ. 7936).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 101.822, -63.211 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 47m 17.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 12' 40.7" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-5 sec,
peaking at ~T+0 sec, and ending at ~T+4 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.4 +- 0.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.7 to T+2.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.53 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
