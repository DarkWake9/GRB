In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190602aq at T0 = 2019-06-02 17:59:27.089
UTC (GCN #24717) a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 showed
 that
the S190602aq 90% c.l. localization region (LR) was not exposed by the Gamma-Ray
Imaging Detector (GRID). The closest exposure in time occurred at T0+100s
covering
about 100% of the LR at off-axis angles between 20 and 70 deg.

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV
over a single time interval after T0, when good exposure of
the S190602aq 90% c.l. LR was available. The following preliminary GRID 3-sigma upper limit (UL) values
are obtained over a large area of the exposed LR:
(T0+100s; T0+200s): from 3.0e-08 to 4.7e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1

An image of the AGILE-GRID 100s exposure near T0 is available at the site
https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/ImgView/Agile/S190602aq_T0+100s_d100s_FM_UL-E50la17

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in
spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
