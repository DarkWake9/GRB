A. Melandri, A. Gomboc, R.J. Smith, N. Tanvir on behalf of 
the Robonet collaboration report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060919 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 5575)
with the Faulkes South Telescope starting at 10:36:10.50 UT
(about 2.8 hours aftert the burst event).

We acquired a first sequence of images in the R-band (6 
exposures each lasting 150 seconds) and a second sequence in 
R and SDSS-I filters (12 exposures lasting 150 seconds in 
each filter).

We did not detect any obvious optical counterpart inside the 
XRT refined error circle (Guidorzi et al., GCN 5577) down to 
a limiting magnitude of R > 19.5 (about 2.92 hours after the
event).

Further analysis and observation are still ongoing.
