and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171101A (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7954) triggered the
CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 10:49:47.91 on 1 November 2017.
The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T+3 sec,
peaks at T+4.5 sec and ends at T+15 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the
SGM data is 6.0 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
