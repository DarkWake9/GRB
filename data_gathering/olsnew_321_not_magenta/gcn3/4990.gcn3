report:

We observed the afterglow of  GRB060418 (Falcone et al. GCN 4966) with 1.5m
telescope of  Maidanak Astronomical Observatory (MAO) in BRI-bands on April
18. A series of BRI images (B: 8x180s, R: 7x120s, I:  9x120s) were taken on
April 18 (UT)  19:54  -  21:07 and  9x120s  I-images were taken between
22:14 - 22:37. We detect OT (Falcone et al. GCN 4966) on single images in I
and R;   preliminary OT brightness estimation of the first I-image
(UT=19:54) is ~20.5. Data reduction is continuing.
