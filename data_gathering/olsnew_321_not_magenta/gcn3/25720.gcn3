D. A. Perley and C. M. Copperwheat (LJMU) report on behalf of the GROWTH 
collaboration:

We acquired imaging and spectroscopy of ZTF19abyfazm/AT2019pwa (Anand et 
al., GCN 25706), an optical transient within the error region of 
gravitational wave trigger S190910d (LVC et al. GCN 25695), with the 2m 
Liverpool Telescope.  A sequence of 60-second images was acquired in g, 
r, and i filters using IO:O, followed by 2x500s of spectroscopy with 
SPRAT, between 20:53 and 21:20 on 2019-09-10 (UT).

The source remains bright and blue, although has faded slightly since 
the time of ZTF discovery (we measure AB magnitudes of g=17.95, r=18.30, 
i=18.65 at approximately MJD=58736.87).  No significant absorption or 
emission features are visible in the spectrum.  We conclude that this 
source is likely the eruption of an uncatalogued cataclysmic variable 
within our Galaxy, although further monitoring will be needed to confirm 
this.

We thank the MOPTOP commissioning team for their patience while 
acquiring these observations.
