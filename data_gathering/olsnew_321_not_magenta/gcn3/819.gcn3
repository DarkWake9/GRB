TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  819
SUBJECT: GRB000926 optical observations
DATE:    00/09/29 23:42:30 GMT
FROM:    Fredrick J. Vrba at USNO  <fjv@nofs.navy.mil>

On behalf of the USNO GRB team, F. Vrba and B. Canzian, report 
two additional R-band photometric measurements of the GRB 000926
optical counterpart, discovered by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 803)
and Dall et al. (GCN 804). Our observations were obtained with
the USNO, Flagstaff Station, 1.0-m telescope. These measurements
are based on a preliminary photometric calibration from a limited
number of standard stars. 

           UT Date       Magnitude

           Sep 28.097    R = 19.70 +/- .03
           Sep 29.146    R = 21.05 +/- .04

If weather permits at a later date, we will produce a fully-calibrated 
UBVRI standard sequence, as we have for several earlier GRB fields.
