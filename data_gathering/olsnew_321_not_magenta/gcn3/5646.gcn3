This announces a slight change to the format of GCN Circulars.
The TITLE string in the banner above is changed from
"GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT" to "GCN CIRCULAR".  This is part 
of a larger change to the GCN system -- the addition of GCN Reports.
The old phrasing is too close to this new Reports product
within GCN.  The content, the intention, the motivation, all all else
will stay the same for the Circulars; only this TITLE string is changing.
I apologize for the inconvenience (if anyone has automated
filtering/processing that keys off this TITLE-string).

There will be a separate announcement describing the new GCN Reports.
