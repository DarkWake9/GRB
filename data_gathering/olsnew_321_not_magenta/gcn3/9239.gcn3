Arto Oksanen (Hankasalmi Obs., Hankasalmi, Finland) reports via the AAVSO 
International High Energy Network the following optical observations of 
GRB 090424 (Cannizzo et al., GCN #9223):

A. Oksanen reports the detection of the optical counterpart of GRB 090424 
approximately 6.5 hours post-burst.  Unfiltered observations were made 
using a 0.4-meter RC telescope with an SBIG STL-1001E CCD.  A total of 
sixty, 60-second observations were made having a mid-point time of 
20:45:00 UT on 2009 April 24.  The afterglow was detected with a magnitude 
of 19.1 +/- 0.1 measured relative to the R band magnitude of USNO-A2.0 
1050-06753889 (R=16.3).  Astrometry of the afterglow position yields a 
position of RA: 12h 38m 05.1s, Dec: +16d 50m 15.3s, in agreement with the 
UVOT coordinates given by Cannizzo et al. (GCN #9223).
