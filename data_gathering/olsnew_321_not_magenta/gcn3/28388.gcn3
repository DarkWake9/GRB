H. Kumar (IITB), P. Dorje (IIA), V. Bhalerao(IITB), G. C. Anupama(IIA), S.
Barway(IIA), report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:

We apologize for the confusion caused in GRB name. GROWTH-India Telescope
followed-up GRB 200907B, not GRB 200907A.


Here is the corrected GCN:-

We observed GRB 200907B reported by Swift-BAT (A.P. Beardmore et al., GCN
#28384, P.A. Evans et al., GCN #28385) with 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope.
The field was observed in the SDSS r filter starting at
2020-09-07T20:59:05.36 UT i.e. ~2.1 hrs after the event detection by
Swift-BAT. We didnâ€™t find any new source in stacked image of 7*500 sec
exposure, within an uncertainty region of 2.2 arcsec around RA(J2000) =
05:56:06.93, Dec(J2000)= +06:54:22.8 (GCN 28385) up to

r > 20.83 mag (5-sigma) (calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data
release, Flewelling
et al., 2018).



The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
