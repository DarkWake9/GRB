Elisabetta Bissaldi (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 05:45:35.68 UT on 2 August 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100802A (trigger 302420737 / 100802240),
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Troja et al. 2010, GCN 11031).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 76 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of an initial peak
followed by a softer tail with a duration (T90) of about 100 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+40 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.17 (+0.21/-0.25) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 149 (+41/-96) keV
(Castor C-STAT 669 for 479 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.24 +/- 0.28)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+62 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.2 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
