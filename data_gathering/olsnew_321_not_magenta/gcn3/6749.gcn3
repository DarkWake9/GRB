T. Sakamoto (NASA/ORAU), G. Sato (GSFC/ISAS) and
M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:54 UT, Swift suffered a loss of star tracker lock, and
the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) then interpreted Sco X-1 as a GRB
(trigger=287421).

The BAT position notice correctly contained the comment line:
COMMENTS:        This trigger occured while the StarTracker had lost 
lock, so it is possibly bogus.

Star tracker recovery is currently underway.

[GCN OPS NOTE(02July15): Per F.Marshall (Swift Team), the trigger
number in the Subject line was changed from "28742" to "287421".]
