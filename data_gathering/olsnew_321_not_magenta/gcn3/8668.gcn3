report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 04:09:41.64 UT on 13 December 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 081213 (trigger 250834182 / 081213173).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data,
is RA = 25.5, Dec = -35.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 01h 42m, -35d 18'), with an uncertainty
of 12.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51 degrees.

This short GRB consists of a single peak with a duration of about 50 ms.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
