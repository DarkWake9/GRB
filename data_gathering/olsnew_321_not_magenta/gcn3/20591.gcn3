report on behalf of a larger collaboration


We observed the field of Swift GRB 170202A (Racusin et al., GCN#20575) with
the 1.0 meter T100 telescope (Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey), starting February, 2, 20:12:45.56 UT (~ 1.7 hours after the
trigger). Observations were carried out in the R filter. The afterglow is
detected in the R band images with an exposure time of 300 s.


Using USNO-B1 stars USNO-B1 0950-0184329 (R.A.=152.492, Dec=+5.028) and
USNO-B1 0949-0181744 (R.A.=152.514, Dec=+4.993) in the field, the magnitude
of the OT was estimated as follows;


t-t0 (hr) exp.(s) filt mag err (+/-)

1.75 300 R 18.98 0.07


Analysis of further observations with the same filter is ongoing.


We thank to TUBITAK National Observatory for a partial support in using
T100 telescope with project number 10CT100-95 and technical support.
