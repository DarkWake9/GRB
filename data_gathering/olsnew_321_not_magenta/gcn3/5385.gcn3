P. J. Brown & J. L. Racusin (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began taking settled exposures
on the field of the short hard GRB060801
(BAT Trigger #222154), 67 s after the BAT trigger
(Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 5378).  No new source,
relative to the DSS, is seen inside the refined XRT
error circle (Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 5382) or at
the positions of the optical sources reported by
Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN Circ. 5384).
The 3-sigma upper limits for the first finding
charts and the coadded images are listed below.

Finding charts:

Filter  T_range(s)    Exposure (s)    3-sigma UL
White   67-166        100             19.9
V       173-572       400             19.5

Coadded images:

Filter  T_range(s)    Exposure (s)    3-sigma UL
White   67-7181       461             20.8
V       173-6309      1023            20.1
B       651-7127      412             20.6
U       627-6922      432             20.3
UVW1    603-6718      432             20.3
UVM2    579-6513      245             20.2
UVW2    679-6104      236             20.4

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. These
upper limits have not been corrected for the estimated
Galactic reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.018 mag (Schlegel et
al. 1998).
