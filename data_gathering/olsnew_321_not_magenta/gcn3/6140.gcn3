MASTER Very Wide Field Camera located at Kislovodsk Solar Station
(http://observ.pereplet.ru, D=70 mm, 420 square degrees, 11 Mpixel's CCD) 
has moved to the Swift-BAT trigger 261880 and it has taken a series of 5s
exposures starting 2 s after notice arrivel time at  20:29:38.285 UT under 
good weather  condition and waxing moon.

We note that the GBR position (J. L. Racusin et al. GCN Circ No. 6137) was
at 4 degrees outside of the our field of view.

We note that the VWF camera continuously takes frames during the night.
These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).
The robot not find OT-candidate.
