behalf of larger  GRB follow up collaboration  report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 080810 (Page et al. GCN 8080) with 1.5  m 
telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) under good weather  conditions. 
Series of R and B images were obtained between Aug. 10 (UT) 
16:50:03 -18:17:06.  While we clearly detect afterglow in single R images, 
the afterglow is not detected in a combined image obtained in B. A 
photometry of the combined images is based on several SDSS nearby stars:

  0.1599      B      14x60    n/d            19.26      ~2.7"
  0.1786      R      30x60   17.98 +/- 0.13  20.85      ~2.2"
  0.2026      R      30x60   18.10 +/- 0.17  21.14      ~2.0"

The photometry in R-band is an agreement with power law decay index of 
light curve (alpha = 1.12) between 400 s and 1 day after the burst  reported 
by Thoene et al (GCN 8106).
