D. A. Perley, J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), J. Kalirai (STSCI), R. 
Strickler, E. Ramirez-Ruiz (UCSC), and A. A. Miller (UCB) report:

We began a series of deep optical imaging exposures on the field of GRB 
081221 (Hoversten et al., GCN 8687) using the Keck I telescope (+LRIS) 
starting at 2008-12-23 at 5:06 UT.  We acquired 10x330s in g-band and 
10x300s in I-band (simultaneously using the 560 dichroic).

A extended source coincident with the Gemini (Tanvir et al., GCN 8698) 
and Swift XRT (GCN 8690) afterglow positions is clearly detected in our 
g-band stack, which we tentatively identify as the host galaxy.  The 
magnitude within a 1.0" aperture of this object is approximately B~25.4 
(calibrated relative to the USNO star at RA=15.797098, dec=-24.412259, 
B2=19.59).  It is only marginally detected in the I-band imaging, with 
an estimated magnitude of I~24.5, though photometry in this band is 
complicated by blending with a nearby object.

The detection of a host galaxy would be consistent with a low-redshift 
origin (GCN 8698).  Within the significant uncertainties of the 
photometric calibration the color of the galaxy appears typical of 
normal GRB hosts.  Further analysis is planned.
