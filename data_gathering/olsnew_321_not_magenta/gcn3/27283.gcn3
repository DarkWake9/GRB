In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200302c at T0 = 2020-03-02
01:58:11.519 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 65% of the S200302c 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S200302c localization
region, from a minimum of 1.3E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.1E-06 erg
cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power-law with photon index 1.5).

An independent procedure based on photon counting statistics provides UL
fluences in the range 0.4-1 MeV, for a 300 us integration time, from a
minimum of 1.0E-08 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 4.4E-08 erg cm^-2.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
