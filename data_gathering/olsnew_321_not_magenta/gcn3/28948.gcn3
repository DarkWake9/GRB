report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2020-11-22T08:32:01.000 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 201122A (trigger ID: HEB201122355) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered INTEGRAL.

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 11.68 s measured from T0+0.69 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.65 s, is 863 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 2964 counts.

regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
