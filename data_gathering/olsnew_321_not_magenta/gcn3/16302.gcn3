We observed the field of GRB 140518A (Melandri, et al., GCN 16298) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/05 18.41 to 2014/05 18.46 UTC (0.60
to 1.75 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.71 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.30 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

We detect the fading source identified by Zheng et al. (GCN 16299) and 
Perley et al. (GCN 16300) within the Swift-XRT error circle.
We confirm this to be the optical afterglow of GRB 140518A.

In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we
obtain the following detections:

  r	20.50 +/- 0.04
  i	19.00 +/- 0.02
  Z	18.59 +/- 0.03
  Y	18.19 +/- 0.03
  J	18.13 +/- 0.02
  H	17.80 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
Based on these observations, and using our automatic photo-z
analysis tool (Littlejohns et al. arXiv:1312.3967) we determine two possible
photometric redshifts: assuming a Milky Way extinction curve for the GRB 
host we derive a photo-z of z=1.88 (+- 0.06) and A_V=1.8, while a SMC 
extinction law gives a z=4.63 (+- 0.11) and A_V=0.5. 
The second solution is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift
reported by Chornock et al. (GCN 16301).


We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
