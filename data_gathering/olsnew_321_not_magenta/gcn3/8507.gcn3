Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081109A (trigger #334112)
(Immler, et al., GCN Circ. 8500).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 330.798, -54.711 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 03m 11.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 42' 40.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a smooth rise to a single peak
starting at ~T-90 sec, peaking at ~T+5 sec, and roughly exponentially decaying
back to baseline at ~T+400 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 190 +- 60 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.9 to T+416.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.72 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.0 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
