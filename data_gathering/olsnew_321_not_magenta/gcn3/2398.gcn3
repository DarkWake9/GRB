I. Mitrofanov, S. Charyshnikov, V. Grinkov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, and
A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and Mars Odyssey-HEND observed this GRB at 76238
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 13
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  5.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 40000 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000) 
ERROR BOX CENTER:    9 h 28 m 27.18 s    -74 o 04 '  11.61 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  9 h 36 m 05.56 s    -74 o 09 '  42.00 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 13 h 14 m 12.67 s    -72 o 32 '  38.03 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  6 h 56 m 58.26 s    -62 o 28 '  23.43 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  9 h 20 m 52.86 s    -73 o 57 '  40.43 "

This error box may be improved, but as Mars, Earth, and Ulysses are
practically aligned, a small error box cannot be obtained for this
event.
