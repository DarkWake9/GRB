C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-210608A
(GCN 30153), the reported position:

RA: 337.41 (+4.89 -11.64 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: +18.37 (+3.75 -3.24 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 6.3 minutes
prior until 29.4 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM
observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
