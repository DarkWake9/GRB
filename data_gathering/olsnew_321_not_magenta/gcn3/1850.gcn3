D.W. Fox (Caltech) and P.A. Price (RSAA/ANU) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO GRB collaboration:

"We have imaged the full corrected localization region of GRB030131
(GCN 1847) with the Palomar 48-inch Oschin Telescope + NEAT camera, in
six 120s exposures over 10:42 UT to 11:31 UT on 31 Jan 2003.  The
summed image from these unfiltered exposures reaches a limiting
magnitude of R~21 mag as estimated from the magnitude of several
USNO-A2.0 stars in the image.  We identify no bright new sources by
reference to images from the Second Digitized Sky Survey.  We estimate
the magnitude of any new source to be R>20 mag at the mean epoch of
our observations, 11:16 UT, which is 3.62 hours after the burst.

"In particular, the afterglow candidate of Oksanen (GCN 1849) is not
present in our image, and we estimate R>21 for the quoted position at
this epoch."
