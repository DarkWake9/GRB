We selected a bunch of galaxies from the GLADE catalog, which overlap 
with the high probability map of the LIGO GW event S190426c (GCN 24237) 
and are accessible to the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, 
Xinjiang, China. Due to weather constraint, we obtained ten field images 
with reasonable depth. Observations started at 17:19:27 UT on 2019-04-26 
and ended at 18:40:06 UT on 2019-04-26, with each unfiltered exposure of 
120 sec. Typical limiting depth is of ~18.5 mag.

Below listed are the observed galaxies:
