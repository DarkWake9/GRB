We observed the field of short-duration GRB 140622A (D'Elia, et al., GCN
16433) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/06 22.40 to
2014/06 22.47 UTC (1.2 minutes to 1.70 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 1.20 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.51
hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne, et al., GCN
16434), in comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r     > 23.64
  i     > 23.49
 Z     > 19.41
  Y     > 18.73

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
