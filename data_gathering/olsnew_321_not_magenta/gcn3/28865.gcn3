The AMON,  IceCube and HAWC collaborations report:

The AMON NuEm stream channel found a coincidence alert from the
IceCube online neutrino selection + HAWC daily monitoring analysis.
The analysis looks for IceCube neutrino events -mostly atmospheric
in origin- around the position and transit time of a HAWC cluster of
likely gamma rays, as identified in the integrated observations from
a single transit, in this case having a duration of 6.42 hours.

The HAWC transit interval is  from 11, 07, 2020 09:29:47 UT to
11 07, 2020, at 15:55:31 UT
(End of the HAWC transit time)
The location of the coincidence is reported as
RA (J2000): 140.20 deg
Dec (J2000): 29.76 deg
Location uncertainty (50% containment): 0.149 deg (statistical only).
Location uncertainty (90% containment): 0.271 deg (statistical only).

The false alarm rate (FAR) of this coincidence is 3.49 per year.
We encourage follow-up observations of the alert region contingent on
availability of resources and interest, given the quoted FAR.

AMON seeks to perform a real-time correlation analysis of the
high-energy signals across all known astronomical messengers. More
