Mini-MegaTORTORA nine-channel wide-field monitoring system  with high
temporal resolution responded to the BAT trigger and observed the position
of GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 30261) since 2021-06-20 00:00:20 UT
(T+55 s, during the ongoing gamma-ray emission) and until 2021-06-20
00:10:28 UT (T + 663 s). The system simultaneously acquired series of
frames with 1 s exposures, 5 s exposures and 30 s exposures in white light,
10 s exposures in B filter, and 10 s exposures in V filter.

The transient was clearly detectable in all acquired sequences except B
filter ones. Overall behaviour of the early light curve is consistent with
the smooth decay reported by Jelinek et al. (GCN 30263), with no
large-amplitude variability apparent in high temporal resolution data.

Mini-MegaTORTORA belongs to Kazan Federal University and is located at
Special Astrophysical Observatory near Russian 6-m telescope.
