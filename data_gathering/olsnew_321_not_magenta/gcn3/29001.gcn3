Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al, 2020, arXiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 201208A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM Final Real-time (GCN #28998).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-12-08 06:03:32.500 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 383 (+53, -58) cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 2992 (+511, -554) cts. The local mean background count rate was 757 (+3, -5) cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 39.75 (+5, -14) s. A weak signal was also seen in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. 

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
