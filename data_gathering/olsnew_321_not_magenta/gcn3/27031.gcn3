The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:26:28 UT on 11 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200211A (trigger 603098793.826514 / 200211310).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 345.2, Dec = -7.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 00m, -7d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 68.0 degrees.
