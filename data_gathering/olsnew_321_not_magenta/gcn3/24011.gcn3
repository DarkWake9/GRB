report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-03-24T22:44:20.500 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 190324A(trigger ID: HEB190324947) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Swift/BAT(S. J. LaPorte et al. ,GCN 23993),
Fermi/GBM(F. Kunzweiler et al. ,GCN 23994) and CALET/CGBM(Y. Sone 
et al. ,GCN 24006).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of two 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 6.41 s measured from T0+0.14 s.
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+1.283 s, is 1111 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 3551 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
