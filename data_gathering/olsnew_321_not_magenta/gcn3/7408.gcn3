K. Kinugasa, S.Honda, O.Hashimoto, H.Taguchi (Gunma Astronomical
Observatory)  report:

 The field of GRB 080307 (Holland et al. GCN 7362) was observed
with the 150 cm telescope of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Starting at 13:06 UT (1.67 hours after the burst), Rc, Ic, and
V frames were acquired for 3 x 5-min, 6 x 5-min, and 2 x 5-min
exposures, respectively.

 We do not identified the optical counterpart reported by
Tanvir et al. (GCN 7369) to 3-sigma limiting magnitudes of
Rc=21.5 and Ic=21.0 relative to USNO-B1.0 magnitudes.
