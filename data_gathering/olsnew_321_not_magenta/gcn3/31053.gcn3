(HETH/IAA-CSIC) report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 211023A (Zhirkov et al, GCN 30977, see 
also  Kann et al, GCN 30982; Hu et al,  GCN 30990; Belkin et al, GCN 
31004; Vinko et al, GCN 31008; Belkin et al, GCN 31018; Belkin et al, 
GCN 31020; Kumar et al, GCN 31023; Gupta et al., GCN 31041; Strobl et 
al., GCN 31042)  with BTA  SAO RAS telescope equipped with SCORPIO-2 
(VPHG940@600 grism). A total of 7200 s (6x1200 s) of spectra were 
obtained starting on 21-11-05 (UT) 20:50:00, i.e. approximately 13.3016 
days after burst. The afterglow is well detected in the acquisition 
imaging with R = 21.61 +/- 0.04 (3 x 90 sec. 21-11-05 (UT) 20:43:59 -- 
20:50:58), and a continuum is visible across the bandwidth of a spectrum 
4000 - 8500 A. The spectrum contain  significant emission lines H_beta, 
[OII] 3727, [OIII] 5007,  at a common redshift of z=0.390. We assume 
that the lines are from a host galaxy and, therefore, this is the 
redshift of GRB 211023A. No evident lines of a possible SN were found.

Calibration of photometry is preliminary and based on nearby stars of 
PS1 catalogue, gri -> R by Lupton transformations.

We are grateful to the directorate of SAO RAS for the TOO allocation.
