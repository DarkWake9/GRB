and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 161106A (Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 20140;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 11:57:52.938) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:57:50.79 on 6 November 2016.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a FRED-like structure with possible overlapping pulses.
The emission starts at T0, peaks at T0+5 sec and ends at T+15 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 9.1 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
