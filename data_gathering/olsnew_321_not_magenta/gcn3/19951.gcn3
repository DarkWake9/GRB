The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160917A (Racusin et al., GCN 19926) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Sep 17.65, Sep 20.87, and 
Sep 24.87 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Evans 
et al., GCN 19927), with 3sigma upper limits of 150 uJy, 84 uJy, and 90 
uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
