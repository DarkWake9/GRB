S. B. Cenko, E. O. Ofek (Caltech), D. Gelino (Michelson Science Center,
Caltech), Tommy Thompson (UC-San Diego), P. A. Price (IfA), and E. Berger
(Carnegie) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060814 (Moretti et al.; GCN 5447) with the
Wide Field Infrared Camera mounted on the Palomar 200" Hale Telescope.
Images were taken in the Ks band at a mean epoch of approximately 03:25 15
August UT (~ 4.4 hours after the burst).

Near the revised XRT error circle (Moretti et al.; GCN 5451), we find
only the possible counterpart identified by Levan et al. (GCN 5455) and
Malesani (GCN 5456).  We measure the magnitude of this extended object to
be Ks ~ 18.2 (calculated with respect to several nearby 2MASS objects).
This is in agreement with the measurement of Levan et al. several hours
later, indicating significant host contribution to any possible afterglow.

The limiting magnitude of our co-added stack is approximately Ks > 18.5.
