H.-F. Yu (MPE) and P. Veres (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered on 5 events:
485253431/160518359, 485255367/160518382, 485258850/160518422,
485260086/160518436, and 485276375/160518625.

Two of these triggers on 18 May 2016, 485255367/160518382 at 09:09:23.91 UT,
which also triggered Swift/BAT (GCN 19433, D'Avanzo et al.), and
485276375/160518625 at 14:59:31.08 UT, were tentatively classified as GRBs. 
These triggers are in fact due to SGR 1935+2154. 

Further triggers from this source are possible and we will not issue a circular 
for individual triggers from the source, even those that are misclassified as GRBs."
