  The Swift UVOT began observing the field of GRB 050504
(Mereghetti et al, GCN 3348) 5.45 hours after the trigger.
We have co-added all UVOT V-band exposures of GRB 050504
taken between 13:27 UT and 13:45 UT, for a total exposure
time of 989 seconds.

  No new source is detected within a 2 arcmin radius error
circle around the position given by Mereghetti et al. We
obtain a three sigma upper limit from the summed image of
V=20.2.

  The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured
in orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
