We observed the field of GRB 170208B (Siegel et al., GCN 20632) with the 
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) on February the 9th,
starting at 3:10 UT (4.7 hours after the trigger). We
performed a series of exposures in the clear filter. The weather
conditions were good during the  first hour of observation.

We co-added the exposures taken between 3h10UT and 4h17UT. At the 
position of the X-ray afterglow reported by Goad et al. (GCN 20635), we 
do not detect any optical emission, with an upper limit of R ~ 19 
(estimated from nearby USNO-B1 stars).

Magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is
still in its commissioning phase.
