S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), H. A. Krimm (GSFC/USRA),
C. B. Markwardt (CRESST/GSFC/UMD), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:49:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located trigger 306379.  Swift did not slew and will not slew to this location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 274.679, -17.068 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 18m 43s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 04' 04"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This position is consistent with the known
transient SAX J1818.6-1703.  Therefore, it is not a gamma-ray burst.
