LIGO/Virgo S190510g: DESGW counterpart candidates over 80% of the GW localization area

Marcelle Soares-Santos for the DESGW collaboration


We report candidate counterparts to the binary neutron star merger S190510g reported by the LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration (GCN Circular No. 24442, updated GCN Circular No. 24448). The region was imaged by DECam on the night of 2019 May 10 (GCN Circular No. 24467) in g,r,z bands.


These candidates were identified by our difference imaging pipeline. All newly obtained images were subtracted from deep pre-existing Dark Energy Survey images. The total coverage difference imaged is 28 fields of 3 square degrees each, i.e., a total of 84 square degrees which overlap ~80% of the total localization probability of S190510g.


After processing the entire area, we select high-confidence detections (machine learning score>0.7, rejecting dipoles) and perform post-processing vetting of the candidates (rejection of variable objects, matching to host galaxies, and visual inspection).


The resulting list of candidates is provided. We encourage followup:

desgw-190510j  92.307977 -35.149829  20.75 0.02 r 58613.983  0.17 Redshift suggests possible association with S190510g

As an alternative means of selecting high interest candidates, we used KN-Classify, a random forest classifier trained on transient light curves from PLAsTiCC models to determine the probability of a transient being a kilonova. The only such candidate found that survived the vetting process was also found by the normal method and is listed in the table above (desgw-190510c).


Transients matched to a galaxy at a redshift beyond distances plausible for the S190510g event are interpreted as supernova unassociated with S190510g.
