and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S200114f T0 = 2020-01-14 02:08:18.239 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 26734), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-4 min to T0+4 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high 
energy trigger mode at the trigger time of S200114f. Using
the CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in the
10-100 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger 
time and found no candidates in the overwrap region with the
LIGO-Virgo high probability localization region.  The 90% upper
limit of CAL is 4.7 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) when the
summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 80%. The CAL FOV
was centered at RA= 111.2 deg, DEC= +50.7 deg at T0.
