TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 49531 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately    20.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.0E-05 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  9.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 1.00 second.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with 
approximate area  66. sq. arcmin. whose coordinates are:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  22 h 18 m 27.70 s      1 o  5 '  38.89 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 22 h 18 m 33.37 s      1 o  3 '  20.50 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 22 h 17 m 27.99 s      1 o  6 '  51.96 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 22 h 19 m 26.75 s      1 o  4 '  29.18 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 22 h 18 m 22.02 s      1 o  7 '  57.30 " 

This error box may be improved.
