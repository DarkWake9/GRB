A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL)
and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 01:48:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 181027A (trigger=868984).  Swift could not slew to the
burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 225.383, +30.891 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 01m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = +30d 53' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~49 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 03:50 UT on 2018 November 06. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
