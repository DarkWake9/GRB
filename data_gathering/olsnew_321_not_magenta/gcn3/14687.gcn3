A. Cucchiara (UCSC), S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf 
of a larger collaboration:

"We obtained spectroscopy of the afterglow of the LAT-GRB 130518A 
(Xiong et al. GCN 14674, Omodei et al. GCN 14675, Evans et al. 
GCN 14678) with Gemini-North / GMOS, beginning a May 20.60 UT 
roughly 2.05 days after the burst. 
Two different central wavelengths were observed giving a coverage 
from ~3850-6730 A. 
We identify several absorption features, including Lyman-alpha,
SiIV(1394,1402), SiII1526, and CIV(1548,1550) at the common
redshift of z=2.488.

This result is consistent with the one reported by Sánchez-Ramírez
et al. (GCN 14685).

We thank the Gemini-staff for their help in performing these
observations."
