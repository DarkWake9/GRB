G.Pizzichini (IASF-CNR, Sezione di Bologna), and I. Bruni (Bologna
Observatory) report:
 
  We have observed the error box of GRB040422 (INTEGRAL trigger
1758; GCN 2572, Mereghetti et al.) with the 152 cm Loiano Telescope
and the BFOSC camera system on April 22, in non perfect sky
conditions (seeing ~ 2 arcsec).
Two 600s Rc images have been obtained at 23.092 and 23.099 UT
respectively (exposition start epochs).
By comparison of the coadded images with the DSS2 catalog we do
not identify any obvious source.
Our limit magnitude, estimated by PSF photometry, results to be
approx 20.1.
Coadded images, observation log and a short comment can be
