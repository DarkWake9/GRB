W. Li, D. Perley, R. J. Foley, A. V. Filippenko, and J. S. Bloom,
University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB team,
report:

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick
Observatory observed GRB 080205 detected with Swift (Trigger 302506)
The automatic sequence started at 07:56:56, 64.3 s after the burst.
The BAT location has been monitored in V, I, and clear filters, with
varying exposure times. Our image processing pipeline found a new
object within the BAT error circle, with the following position:

R. A. = 06:33:00.64
DEC.  = +62:47:32.0  (J2000)

The OA has magnitude of 17.0 (calibrated with USNO B1.0) in a 20s
unfiltered exposure started at 08:01:45 UT, and show apparent variability.
Further observations are on-going.
