Markku Nissinen (Varkaus, Finland) reports to the AAVSO High Energy Network
the following optical observations of GRB 090313 (Chornock, Li, and
Filippenko, GCN #8979; Mao et al., GCN #8980):

Markku Nissinen reports the detection of the optical counterpart of GRB
090313 using the GRAS-04 telescope sited in Mayhill, NM, USA.  A number
of unfiltered observations with varying exposure times were made using
the 0.25-meter telescope with an SBIG ST8XE CCD camera; observations began
approximately 1 hour post burst.  The afterglow was detected in all frames
with astrometric positions matching those given by Chornock, Li, and
Filippenko (GCN #8979) and Updike et al (GCN #8983) to within positional
errors.

The following unfiltered magnitudes were obtained from the observations
using USNO-A2.0 U0975_07146255 (R magnitude = 15.9) as the comparison:
