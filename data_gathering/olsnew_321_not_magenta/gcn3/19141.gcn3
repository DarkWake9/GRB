We observed the field of GRB 160303A (Beardmore et al. GCN 19126)
using the 1.8m telescope at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory
​ ​
(BOAO) in Korea. The observation started at
2016-02-28 13:31:46 UT,
​ ​
or about 2.6 hours after the BAT alert.

We clearly identify the afterglow at the location of the RATIR detection
(Butler et al. GCN 19131) with R = 22.75 +- 0.12 mag in a stacked
image of 6 x 5 min frames (Mid-point: 2016-02-28 13:54). Together with the
​ result​
 at 10
​ ​
hrs after the BAT alert (de Ugarte Postiago et al.
​​
GCN 19136), our photometry unambiguously confirms the fading nature of this
source. Further observation and the analysis of the data are
planned.

We thank the BOAO staffs for their assistance with the observation.
