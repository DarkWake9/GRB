D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), F.I Mirabel (SAp-Saclay) report:

The activity from SGR 1806-20 reported in GCN Circ. 2763 consists of at
least two main bursts whose peak flux and detailed temporal structure
are uncertain due to satellite telemetry saturation. Both are detected up
to at least 200 keV in the IBIS/ISGRI instrument.

The first burst starts at 13:56:43 UT and lasts about 20 s.
Its spectrum over the 15-200 keV range is well fit by an Optically Thin
Thermal Bremsstrahlung model with temperature kT = 45+/-3 keV.
A preliminary analysis gives a lower limit on its fluence of about 1.e-5
erg/cm2 (15-100 keV).

The second burst starts at 13:59:33 UT and lasts about 40 s.
Its OTTB temperature is  kT = 57+/-3 keV and the preliminary
lower limit on its fluence is  2.e-5 erg/cm2 (15-100 keV).
