W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB060110 detected with Swift
(Trigger 176702; Zane et al. GCN 4463).  A series of
images was automatically obtained starting at 08:02:35 UT
(78s after the burst). The OT identified by Bloom (GCN
4471) was outside the field of view for the first several
images. Our first image containing the OT was a 120-s
unfiltered image started at 08:14:24 UT (787s after the burst),
and the OT was at mag 17.9 +/- 0.1 when calibrated to 65 nearby
USNO B1.0 stars.
