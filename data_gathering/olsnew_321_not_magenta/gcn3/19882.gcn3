report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:01:37.64 UT on 29 August 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160829 (trigger 494150501 / 160829334),
which was also detected by the LAT (Racusin et al. 2016, GCN 19879).

The GBM light curve consists of two short peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 0.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.06 s to T0+0.38 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.56 +/- 0.24 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 771.40 +/- 282.00 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.12 +/- 0.49)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.00 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.3 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
