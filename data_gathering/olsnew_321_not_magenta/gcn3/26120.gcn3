T. Laskar (Bath), W. Fong, K. D. Alexander, G. Schroeder, K. Paterson (Northwestern) and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the position of the short-duration GRB 191031D (Fermi-GBM et al., GCN 26111; D'Elia et al., GCN 26112; Mailyan et al., GCN 26118) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) under Program 19B-217 (PI: Fong) beginning on 2019 Oct 31.992 UT (2.4 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz. Based on preliminary analysis, in 1 hour of observations we do not detect any radio emission at or near the position of the XRT afterglow (Osborne et al., GCN 26117) to a 3-sigma limit of 15 microJy. Additional, detailed analysis is ongoing.

We thank Amy Mioduszewski and the rest of the VLA staff for their assistance with rapidly approving and executing these observations. Further observations are planned."
