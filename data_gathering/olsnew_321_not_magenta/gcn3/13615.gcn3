TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13615
SUBJECT: GRB 120803A: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow
DATE:    12/08/10 07:37:50 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and J.L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT re-observed GRB 120803A on 2012 August 10, for 4.1 ks,
starting 5.7 days after the BAT trigger (Racusin et al., GCN Circ.
13565). The X-ray source reported by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 13569) is
no longer detected, to a 3-sigma upper limit of 3.4e-3 ct/sec,
significantly below the level it was seen at previously.

We therefore conclude that this source was the afterglow of GRB 120803A.

The results of the automated analysis for this burst are available at

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
