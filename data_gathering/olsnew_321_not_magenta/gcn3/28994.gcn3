We report on continuing Swift observations of the flat spectrum radio
quasar PMN J0206-1150, associated with the gamma-ray source 4FGL
J0206.4-1151 (Abdollahi et al. 2020, ApJS, 247, 33), the Fermi-LAT
source closest to the location of IceCube 201130A (IceCube
Collaboration; GCN Circ. 28969). After the first Swift observation
performed on 2020 December 1 (ATel #14240, GCN Circ. 28979), the
source has been observed again by Swift between 20:39 UT on 2020
December 2 and 11:24 UT on 2020 December 3 for a total of 3.9 ks.

The source has been detected by XRT with a net count rate of (2.2 +/-
0.9)e-3 cps. As a comparison, the net count rate of the source on
December 1 was (3.1 +/- 0.9)e-3 cps, showing a mild decrease of the
source activity in X-rays.

Assuming a photon index of 1.7, as observed on December 1, and fitting
the X-ray spectrum with an absorbed power law model with a HI column
density consistent with the Galactic value in the direction of the
source (n_H = 1.7 x 10^20 cm^-2, Ben Bekhti N. et al., 2016, A&A, 594,
A116), we obtain a 0.3-10 keV flux (unabsorbed) of 4.1 (+2.4, -2.0) x
10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Simultaneous UVOT observations were performed on 2020 December 2-3 and
the source is detected above 3 sigma in all UVOT filters, except for
the V filter. The measured magnitudes (Vega system) are V > 19.46, B =
19.60 +/- 0.18, U = 18.72 +/- 0.16, W1 = 18.93 +/- 0.15, M2 = 19.17
+/- 0.10, and W2 = 19.21 +/- 0.12. Differently from the X-ray band, a
moderate brightening has been observed from U to M2 filters on
December 2-3 with respect to December 1.

In GCN Circ. 28979 [and ATel #14240] we wrongly reported that the X-ray
source detected by XRT was 2.8 arcmin from the position of PMN
J0206-1150, while it should be 2.8 arcsec.
