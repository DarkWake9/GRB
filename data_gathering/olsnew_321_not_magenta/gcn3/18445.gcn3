Report several transients discovered in and around the 
RA=1hr DEC=+4deg error region as defined in the BAYESTAR 
skymap.fits file. 

This area has been covered in the w and i-bands 
during the routine course of the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients
(see Huber et al. 2015, ATel 7153 and http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/psdb/)
and around 10 supernova candidates are known from the last 
7 days of observations in this region. These are almost certainly all 
unrelated to the GW trigger, as they were discovered days before the 
LIGO/Virgo detection. Details are available on the public webpage above. 

For example, the most recent discovery is a i=18.6 supernova candidate at 
7.2” from the core of MCG -01-59-024 at z=0.033. This was discovered on 57315.31, 
54h before the GW trigger (at position 23:28:24.29 -02:47:57.8)

Pan-STARRS was observing the RA=1hr localisation region (south of dec=0), 
during the night of 2015-10-22. However the observations were taken 5-6hrs
before the LIGO/Virgo detection. Difference imaging and transient searches
are underway and further observations are planned for the 
coming nights. We plan to cover this RA=1hr region with the PS1 1.8m
telescope, 7 sq degree camera, in i and z bands.
