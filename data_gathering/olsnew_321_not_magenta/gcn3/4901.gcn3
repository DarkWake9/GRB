SUBJECT: GRB060206: optical observation

D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT, La Palma),  M. Ibrahimov, (MAO), A. Pozanenko
(IKI)  on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We  observed the localization of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN 4682)  with
1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in R-band between  (UT)
Feb. 07 23:26:38 and Feb. 08 00:36:06 (18x180 s) with a mean seeing 0.95".
We detect the afterglow (Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) at R=20.78 +/- 0.03  at
mean time (UT) Feb. 8.000. Calibration is based on  SDSS stars; Cool et al.,
GCN 4695 using the transformation equations (Lupton, 2005). Combining this
value with a light curve presented by Stanek et al. (astro-ph/0602495) one
can suggest the jet brake later than 0.6 days. The value R=20.78 +/- 0.03 is
also correlated with possible XRT light curve  rebrightening (XRT light
curve presented in the astro-ph/0602495). There is a tentative short time
scale rebrightening within our observation; more detailed calibration is
underway.
