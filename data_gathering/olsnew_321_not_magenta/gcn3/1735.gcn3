(Tenagra Observatories) report:


We imaged 100% of the error box of GRB 021204 with the 32-inch Tenagra II
telescope beginning at 07:58:37 UT on Dec 5 and 08:07:35 UT on Dec 6, 0.7
and 1.7 days after the burst.  For both epochs we integrated in the Ic band
for 600s in eight pointings.  We note that the Galactic extinction along
this line of sight is approximately A_Ic = 0.9 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).

Using the image subtraction software ISIS2 (Alard 2000), we find no
transient to the limiting magnitude of our first epoch images, which we
estimate to be Ic = 21.3 (3 sigma) using 5 USNO-A2.0 stars.
