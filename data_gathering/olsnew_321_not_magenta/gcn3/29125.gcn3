report:

The 25cm robotic telescope FRAM-ORM at La Palma (Spain) reacted robotically
to the Swift alert of GRB201221D (Page et al., GCNC 29112 and Evans et al.
GCNC 29113, GCNC 29119 and 29124), obtaining a series of 20s unfiltered
images starting at 23:07:11.9 UT, i.e. 37.6s post trigger.

We do not detect any new or strongly variable source neither in single
images (detection limit R>~16.9) nor in a combined 40x20s frame (mean exp
time 560s post trigger, with a limit R>~18.5). While we analysed the entire
25'x25' field of view centred at the XRT localization, we did pay a special
attention to the location of the candidate afterglow mentioned by Malesani
& Knudstrup (GCNC 29117) with a negative outcome.
