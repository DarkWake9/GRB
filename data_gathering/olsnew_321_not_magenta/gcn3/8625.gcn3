Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
optically bright GRB 081203B (GCN 8600) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz
on 2008 Dec 05.70 UT. We detect a radio afterglow at the optical
afterglow position quoted by  Andreev et al (GCN 8608). The peak radio
flux at this position is 160 +/- 41 uJy.
