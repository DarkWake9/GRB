Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 20:39:30.398 UTC on 1 January 2020.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a server problem no CGBM GCN notice was automatically
distributed for this event.

The burst light curve shows the main emission episode with two
multi-peaked pulses which starts at T-8.0 sec, peaks at T+8.0 sec and ends
at T+16.8 sec, followed by a weak pulse at ~T0+75 sec.The T90 and T50
durations measured by the SGM data are 15.4 +- 12.0 sec and 1.5 +- 0.1 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
