(MPE), M. Beck, V. Savchenko (ISDC), J. Borkowski (CAMK/Torun), D. Gotz 
(CEA/Saclay) report on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team:

The three GRB reported on 2008-03-19 by the Swift team (GCN 7426, 7427,
7442) have been independently detected by the SPI Anti-Coincidence 
System (ACS) on-board INTEGRAL.

Burst         T0     duration    max counts in 50 msec
------------------------------------------------------
GRB080319A  05:45:41    10s        370
GRB080319B  06:12:47    57s       5500
GRB080319C  12:25:55    25s       1200

The SPI-ACS light curves are available (both as images and data files) 
at http://isdc.unige.ch/Soft/ibas/ibas_acs_web.cgi

The light curves, binned at 50 ms, are derived from 91 independent
detectors with different lower energy thresholds (mainly between 50 keV 
and 150 keV) and an upper threshold at about 100 MeV. The ACS response 
varies as a function of the GRB incident angle. For these reasons we 
caution that the count rates cannot be easily translated into physical 
flux units.
