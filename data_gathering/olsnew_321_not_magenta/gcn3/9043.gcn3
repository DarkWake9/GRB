  F. Harrison (Caltech), B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), D. A. Frail (NRAO),
P. Chandra (RMC), and S. Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

"We observed the field centered at the optical afterglow (GCN
Circ. 9026) of the Fermi GBM/LAT GRB 090323 (GCN Circ. 9021, GCN
Circ. 9035) on March 27.38 UT using the Very Large Array (VLA) at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. We detect an unresolved radio source at the
GRB afterglow position with the flux density of 225+/-35 uJy at
a (J2000) position of:

RA  = 12h 42m 50.292s
DEC = +17d 03' 11.90"

with an uncertainty of 0.05" Further observations are planned.
