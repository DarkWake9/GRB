The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:53:06 UT on 1 Jan 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210101A (trigger 631205591.859738 / 210101620).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 136.7, Dec = 50.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 06m, 50d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 147.0 degrees.
