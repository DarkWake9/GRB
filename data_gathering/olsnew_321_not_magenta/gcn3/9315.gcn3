Refined analysis of ICSP VLF observation of  SGR J1550-5418 bursts on 22nd
January, 2009

In continuation of our previous reports (GCN #8881 and GCN #8900) we present
our refined analysis of VLF observations by ICSP. We identified as many as
73 satellite events (e.g., GCNs 8833, 8835, 8837, 8838) which could be
associated with ionospheric features observed by ICSP VLF receiver at Kolkata.
Some of these events last only tens of seconds which others last longer.
Very often successive events occur even before the earlier one decayed,
making identifications more difficult.

Two images (4450.jpg and 8950.jpg) of the comparison with satellite detections
are in the http://www.bose.res.in/~chakraba/axpsgr3.html. This message may
