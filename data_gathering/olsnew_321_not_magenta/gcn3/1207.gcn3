D. A. Frail (Caltech/NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have continued to monitor the entire HETE-II error circle of
GRB011130 (GCN #1169, 1178) with the VLA at 4.86 GHz. Observations
have been made on 2001 December 4, 6, 7, 9 and 11. In addition,
observations were made at a frequency of 8.46 GHz towards an
un-cataloged radio source noted earlier by Berger and Frail (GCN
#1173). The flux density is similar (350 uJy) at both frequencies and
no strong variability is seen at either frequency. We suggest that
this source is a flat spectrum AGN which is too weak at 1.43 GHz to be
cataloged in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ,
115, 1693).

A search was carried out in all the radio images for counterparts of
the X-ray sources identified by Chandra. None of the initial 10 bright
X-ray sources (GCN #1185) have radio counterparts. Two radio/X-ray
pairs are present in a deeper X-ray search (GCN #1190). These are:
