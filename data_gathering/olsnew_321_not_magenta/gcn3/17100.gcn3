We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 25.27 to 2014/11 25.54
UTC (98.75 to 105.00 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
4.58 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

 r = 20.96 +/- 0.04
 i = 20.75 +/- 0.04
 z > 19.93

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The afterglow has faded by about 0.25 magnitudes in r and i compared to
our observations at 78 hours (Butler et al., GCN 17096). This
corresponds to a steepening of the temporal power law from t^-0.2
between 54 and 78 hours (Butler et al., GCN 17096) to t^-0.9 between 78
and 102 hours.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
