MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB110407   25 sec s after 
notice time and 107 sec after GRB time at 2011-04-07 14:08:28.65 UT. On 
our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within 
SWIFT-BAT error-box.
The 5-sigma unfiltred upper limit has been about 17.8 mag

MASTER II robotic telescope in Tunka also pointed on GRB110407 at same 
time in two polarizations. Unfortunately during this moment there was a 
strong clouds in the given direction and a upper limit very small.
