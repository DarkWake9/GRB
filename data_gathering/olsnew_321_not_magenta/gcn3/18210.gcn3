S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
L.Ducci (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

GRB 150831A (Lien et al. GCN 18209) has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data with a significance slightly below the threshold for 
automatic alert delivery (IBAS Weak Alert n.7228 was distributed at 
10:34:24 UT).

The burst consists of a single peak with duration of 2 s and starting at 
10:34:12 UT.

The IBIS/ISGRI refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 221.0207 deg
DEC.= -25.6474 deg

with an uncertainty of 3   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a fluence of about 3x10e-7 erg/cm2 in the the 20-200 keV 
energy range.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
