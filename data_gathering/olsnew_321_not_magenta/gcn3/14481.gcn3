We continued our follow-up imaging observation of
GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448) in BVRI filters at 
Seoul National University Observatory (SNUO, 0.6m), Sobaeksan 
Optical Astoronomy Observatory (SOAO, 0.6m), and Bohyunsan 
Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO), all located in Korea.

The observations span the time period of about 4 hrs 
between 04-27 11:28 and 04-27 15:48 UT. The GRB afterglow 
(e.g., Elenin et al. GCN 14450; Im GCN 14464) is identified 
in the observed frames at magnitudes of ~16-17 mag

Further analysis of the data is ongoing, and additional follow-up 
observation with these and other facilities is ongoing and planned.

We thank the staffs of SOAO for performing the ToO observation.
