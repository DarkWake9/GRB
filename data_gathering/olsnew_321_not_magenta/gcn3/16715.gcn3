Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) and A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR)  report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We carried out the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 1400808A in the 1390 MHz band on 2014 August 18.66 UT.
We do not detect the radio afterglow of the GRB at the optical position
(Singer et al. GCN 16668). The 3-sigma upper limit at the GRB position
  is 160 uJy and the map resolution is "4.03x1.89".

We thank GMRT staff for making these observations possible.
