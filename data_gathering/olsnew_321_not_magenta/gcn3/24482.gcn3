A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:14:24.36 UT on 11 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190511A (trigger 579251669 / 190511302), 
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Bernardiniet al. 2019, GCN 24472)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 23.7 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of a multipeaked emission episode with 
a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.048 s to T0+31.745 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 147.8 +/- 7.2 keV,
alpha = -0.58 +/- 0.05, and beta = -2.4 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.21 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+24.1924 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 14.2 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
