The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB
170524A (Gropp et al., GCN 21135) as part of the 4pisky program, and
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 May 25.03, May 26.26, May
28.18 and Jun 01.20 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT
location (Evans et al., GCN 21136), with 3sigma upper limits of 162 uJy,
207 uJy, 120 uJy and 126 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
