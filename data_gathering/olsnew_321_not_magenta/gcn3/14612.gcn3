and S.T. Holland report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed xx ks of XRT data for GRB 130508A (Holland  et al. GCN
Circ. 14607),  from 0 s to 0 s after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The best available XRT position 
(using the promptly downlinked event data, the XRT-UVOT alignment and
matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue) is RA, Dec =
305.3218, 34.9583 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 20 21 17.22
Dec(J2000): +34 57 29.9

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.0 (+0.6, -0.5). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.6 (+1.0, -0.8) x 10^22 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 7.7 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 1.0 x 10^-10 (1.3 x 10^-10) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.6 (+1.0, -0.8) x 10^22 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 7.7 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 1.7 sigma
Photon index:	     1.0 (+0.6, -0.5)
