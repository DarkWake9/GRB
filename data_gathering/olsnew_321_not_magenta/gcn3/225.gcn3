TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  225
SUBJECT: GRB 990123; Addendum to GCN 223
DATE:    99/01/25 23:21:07 GMT
FROM:    Andrew S. Fruchter at STScI  <fruchter@stsci.edu>

This GCN is an addendum to GCN 223:
 
Please note that Hjorth et al., GCN 219, do not indicate the position
angle of the slit they used.  Furthermore, to the eye, the OT appears offset
to the south of the apparent host in the finding chart of Odewahn et al.
(GCN 201, see also Gal et al., GCN 213), while the Keck slit lay in
the E-W direction.  Thus the apparent non-detection by Keck of an object
reported in the NOT spectrum may be due to different position angles having
been used in the observations.
