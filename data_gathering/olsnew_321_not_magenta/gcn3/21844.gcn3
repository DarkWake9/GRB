report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 768 observations, covering 653 separate
locations within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G299232
convolved with the 2MPZ catalogue (Bilicki et al. 2014, ApJS, 210, 9),
using the 'bayestar-HLV' GW localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap,
galaxy distances were taken into account in selecting which ones to
observe. The observations currently span from 11 ks to 758 ks after the
LVC trigger, and cover 75.9 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for
overlaps). This covers 8.3% of the probability in the 'bayestar-HLV'
skymap, and 15% after convolving with the 2MPZ galaxy catalogue, as
described by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,  462, 1591). A list of all
observations and exposure times is in GraceDB.

In total, we have detected 51 X-ray sources. Each source is assigned a
rank of 1-4 which describes how likely it is to be related to the GW
trigger, with 1 being the most likely and 4 being the least likely. The
ranks are described at http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 1 source of rank 2
  * 30 sources of rank 3
  * 20 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7

RANK 2 source
=============

This is a catalogued X-ray source which was detected at a level well
above the catalogued flux. However, this is an RS CVn variable star, so
this is not surprising. We do not consider this the counterpart.

  
  Source 11:
  =============
    RA: 	 26.7914 ( = 01h 47m 9.94s) J2000
    Dec:	 +23.7585 ( = +23d 45' 30.6") J2000
    Error:	 +4.1 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 7.6e-02 +/- 1.5e-02 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 3.3e-12 +/- 6.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
    Catalogued:  Yes
    Cat Source:  1RXS J014709.9+234529 in the ROSAT/RASSFSC catalogue
    Separation:  1.7" from the XRT source
    Cat Rate:	 2.6e-02 +/- 1.1e-02 ct/sec 
    Cat Flux:	 7.3e-13 +/- 3.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
		 so the source	is 3.6-sigma above the catalogued flux.

    There is no evidence for fading.
    NOTE: this source is NOT within 200 kpc of a GWGC or 2MPZ galaxy
      which is consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW 

      object.
    A SIMBAD object `V* BE Ari' is 4.1" away.
    There is 1 2MASS object within the source's 3-sigma error radius.


RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.

RANK 4 sources
==============

These are catalogued X-ray sources, showing no signs of outburst
compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger. Therefore, we do not list details of the sources
here.
