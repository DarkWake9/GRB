A.L. Homewood, K.V. Garimella, D.H. Hartmann (Clemson University), R.
Kaitchuck (BSU), and J.S. Shaw (UGA), report on behalf of the Clemson GRB
Follow-Up Team:

We began observations of the error box reported by Morris, et al (GCN
4682), beginning approximately 2.5 hours after the burst trigger. We
confirm the afterglow reported by Fynbo, et al (GCN 4683). We derive a
magnitude of R=17.77 +/- 0.26 mag after co-adding 10 300-second exposures
and calibrating relative to the USNO A2.0 catalog. The image may be found

No extinction corrections have been made. Observations are continuing.
