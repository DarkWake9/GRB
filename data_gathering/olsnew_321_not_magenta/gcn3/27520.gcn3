report:

We observed the position of the GRB 200410A (Simpson et al., GCN 27518)
with the D50 telescope of the Astronomical Institute Ondrejov, near Prague,
Czech Republic, obtaining a series of 10s unfiltered images starting at
02:26:05.4UT, i.e. 55s post trigger.

The optical afterglow reported from UVOT (Simpson et al., GCN 27518) is
detected in the early single 20 s images.

We note the presence of two nearby stars which may confuse the observer
and/or complicate photometry. For this reason, we do not provide brightness
at this stage.
