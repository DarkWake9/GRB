I. Tanaka, (Subaru Telescope, NAOJ), N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech), C. Tokoku,
M. Akiyama (Subaru Telescope, NAOJ), T.Ichikawa, T. Koyano (Tohoku
Univ.), T. Yoshikawa, and M. Konishi (Tohoku Univ/Subaru Telescope)
report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team and the MOIRCS team:

"We observed the field of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) 
with MOIRCS on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope at 11:02 UT (11.8 hours
after the burst).

With the 2x60s exposure, we detected the source with Ks=18.4 +/- 0.2.
Comparison with the earlier NIR detection (Hearty et al., GCN 5126)
implies a decay index of 1.05 +/- 0.07 in the Ks band.
It is consistent with the decay index reported by Cenko (GCN 5125)
based on the R band observations at 46 min (Mundell and Steele, GCN
5119) and 4.6 hours after the burst. "
