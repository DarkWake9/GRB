Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190701A (trigger #912310)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 24934).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 28.131, 58.899 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  01h 52m 31.5s 
  Dec(J2000) = +58d 53' 56.9" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 52%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure.  The main period
of emission includes three broad peaks between roughly T+0 sec and T+100 sec,
peaking about T+38 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 52.4 +- 4.0 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+35.0 to T+90.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.91 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.7 +- 1.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+37.92 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
