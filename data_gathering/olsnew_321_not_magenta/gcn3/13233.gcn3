We observed the counterpart to GRB 120404A (Stratta et al., GCN Circ.
13208) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 13:50 UT on
2012-04-04, corresponding to 59 minutes after the burst trigger.
Exposures totaling one hour were made in marginal weather conditions.
No source was detected, with a preliminary RMS of 4.1 mJy at 850 microns.

We thank William Montgomerie for his prompt support of these observations.
