H.A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA),  J. R. Cummings (CRESST/GSFC/UMBC), 
A.P. Beardmore
(U. Leicester)report on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

In further analysis of GRB 071018 (Krimm et al, GCN 6932), when
we use a time interval of T+20 to T+470 and an energy interval
of 14 to 100 keV, we get a higher significance detection with a
position:

RA, dec =  164.685, +53.822 deg, which is
RA(J2000) = 10h 58m 44.4s
dec(J2000) = 53d 49' 18"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).

We note that this new error circle is inconsistent with any of the 
sources found in
the XRT (Beardmore et al, GCN 6943) or optical  (Xin et al, GCN 6936). However,
XRT source #5 (Krimm et al, GCN Report 96.1) at RA, dec = 164.7216, 
+53.8140 deg,
is within the new error circle.
