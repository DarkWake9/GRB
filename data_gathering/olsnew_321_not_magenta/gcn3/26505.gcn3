The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1) and Virgo Observatory (V1) data around the time of the compact
binary merger (CBC) candidate S191216ap (GCN Circular
26454). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0,
distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the
GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S191216ap

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 253 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 376 +/- 70 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
