Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201001A (trigger #998344)
(Simpson, et al., GCN Circ. 28539).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 110.050, -2.213 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  07h 20m 12.0s 
  Dec(J2000) = -02d 12' 48.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 38%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad single peak of duration roughly 
20 seconds, from ~T-5 to ~T+15 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 15.2 +- 2.7 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.02 to T+12.98 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.96 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.6 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+10.79 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
