A. D. Falcone, D. N. Burrows, Jamie Kennea (PSU), report on behalf of 
the Swift XRT team:

Following the Malindi gap, we have analyzed the initial Swift XRT data
from GRB 060418 (Falcone et al., GCN4966), with a total exposure of 1.4 
   ks.  The refined XRT position is:

RA(J2000) = 15 45 42.4
Dec(J2000) = -03 38 22.8

We estimate an uncertainty of 4 arcseconds radius (90% containment).

In addition to the afterglow decay, the early light curve has bright
flaring.  The largest flare has a peak of about 460 c/s at approximately 
128 s after the trigger time.  Aside from the flaring, the light curve 
is clearly fading, but the rate is difficult to estimate due to the 
flaring and the limited data available at this time.  A preliminary 
estimate of the power law decay index is approximately 0.6 ± 0.3.
