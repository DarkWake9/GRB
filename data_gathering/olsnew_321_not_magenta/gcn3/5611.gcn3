Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060923
(trigger #230711)  (Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 5591;
Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ 5600).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 346.122, 3.943 deg {23h 4m 29.3s, 3d 56' 33.8"} (J2000)
+- 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial 
coding was 17%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve has a single long emision from T+0 to T+110 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 76 +- 2 sec (estimated error including systematics). 
The long duration and smooth profile of the lightcurve suggest, 
but do not prove, that this is a high redshift burst.  

The time-averaged spectrum from T+6.8 to T+90.7 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.27 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
1.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+27.54 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec. 
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
