V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), V. Kumar (IUCAA), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of Astrosat data showed the detection of GRB 160508A
(Marrocchesi et al., GCN 19422; INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7459; Konus-Wind
trigger time on 14:32:38.795 UT) in CZTI data. The source was clearly
detected in the 40-240 keV energy range. The light curve shows a single
peak at UT 14:32:37.7 and a peak count rate of 416.6 counts/sec above
the background (four quadrants summed together), with a total of 3373
counts. The local mean background count rate was 84.0 counts/sec.  Using
cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 25.0 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=node/9. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC
and PRL.The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and
facilitated the project.
