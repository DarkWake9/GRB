We observed the field of GRB 220708B detected by Swift/BAT-GUANO 
(Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 32345) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at 
Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 10x200 s frames in the Sloan 
r-band and 9x200 s frames in Sloan z-band, starting at 19:15:57.859 UT 
on 2022-07-08,i.e.,17.15 hr after the BAT trigger.

No optical source is detected in our stacked images at the  XRT 
afterglow position (Osborne et al., GCN 32350), with upper limits as 
follows:

T_mid-T0 (hr)    Filter   Upper limit(3-sigma)
    17.42               r         >21.60
    17.96               z         >19.54

calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field and not corrected for 
Galactic extinction.
