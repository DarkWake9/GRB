A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA) and P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

"We have analysed 3.9 ks of XRT data for the Fermi/GBM and LAT-detected 
short GRB 140619B (Connaughton et al., GCN Circ. 16419; Kocevski et al., 
GCN Circ. 16420), from 48.7 ks to 71.6 ks after the GBM trigger. The 
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No bright X-ray 
afterglow is detected within the LAT error circle. The three sigma upper 
limit is 2.9E-03 cts/s.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team."
