Liverpool Telescope Spectroscopy of iPTF-17bq and iPTF-17ee

I.A. Steele, A.S. Piascik, M.J.Darnley, C.M. Copperwheat (LJMU), M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech) and D. Perley (Dark Cosmology Centre, Copenhagen) report on behalf of a lager collaboration.

We report spectroscopy of the iPTF counterparts iPTF-17bq and iPTF-17ee.  The data were obtained with the SPRAT spectrograph of the Liverpool Telescope, La Palma, on the night of 2017 January 08 with a resolution R=350 and a wavelength range of 400-800nm.

In both cases the transient could not be clearly distinguished from the host galaxy in our spectra, which were obtained in poor (~2 arcsec) seeing.

iPTF17-bq shows a galaxy spectrum with redshift (SNID) z=0.059 and AGN-like emission lines.
iPTF17-ee shows a galaxy spectrum with redshift (SNID) z=0.085.
