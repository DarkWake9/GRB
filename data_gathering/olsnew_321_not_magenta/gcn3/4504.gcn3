"The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North (Hawaii) robotically followed up
GRB060114 (INTEGRAL trigger 2733) 1.9 min after the GRB trigger time.
The automatic "detection mode" procedure did not find any afterglow
candidate brighter than R~19 mag (vs USNOB1) from a 6x10s exposure.
The visual extinction of the field is negligible (A_V~0.1) according
to the Schlegel et al. maps.
Further automated observations were conducted immediately following the
"detection mode" exposures in R and SDSS-I filters.
Manual inspection of subsequent datasets
reveals no afterglow candidate down to the DSS limit."
