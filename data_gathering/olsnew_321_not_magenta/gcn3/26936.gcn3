A. Goldstein (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team and the
GBM-LIGO/Virgo group:

For S200129m and using the bayestar.fits.gz,1 skymap, Fermi-GBM did not
observe any of the localization probability at event time due to Earth
occultation. Therefore, the GBM observations are not constraining for
prompt gamma-ray emission.
