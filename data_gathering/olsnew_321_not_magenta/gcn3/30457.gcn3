Bernardini (INAF-OAB), E. Ambrosi  (INAF-IASFPA) , J. D. Gropp (PSU),
J.A. Kennea (PSU) and B. Sbarufatti report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 8.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 210712A (Sbarufatti et al.
GCN Circ. 30447), from 86 s to 44.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 164 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 30453).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.4 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.06 (+0.10, -0.09).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.52 (+/-0.06). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.10 (+0.22, -0.21) x 10^21 cm^-2,
consistent with the Galactic value of 8.9 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.98 (+0.13,
-0.09) and a best-fitting absorption column consistent with the
Galactic value. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.3 x 10^-11 (4.0 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     8.9 (+2.9, -0.0) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 8.9 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.98 (+0.13, -0.09)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.06, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.015 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.9 x
10^-13 (5.9 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
