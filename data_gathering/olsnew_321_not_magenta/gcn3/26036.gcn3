I. Reva (FAPHI), A. Pozanenko (IKI), M. Krugov (FAPHI), S. Belkin (IKI), 
  E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI) report on behalf of IKI-GRB-FuN:

We observed the field of GRB 191019A (Simpson  et al.  GCN 26031) with 
Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory starting 
on Oct. 19 (UT) 15:26:32, i.e. 14 minutes after GRB trigger.   Within 
XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 26034) we found only one source 
which is presented in catalogs.   Preliminary photometry of the source 
is following.

The photometry is based nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.

The brightness of the catalogued source is R2(USNO-B1.0 340.024514480) = 
19.36 and r'(Pan-STARRS 0726-1153339) = 19.30. The source is probably a 
host galaxy of  GRB 191019A and we suggest the afterglow of the source 
on a top of the host galaxy.
