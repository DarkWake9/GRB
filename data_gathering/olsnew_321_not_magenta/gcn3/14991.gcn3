GRB 130702A: Continued UVOT Observations

B. Porterfield (PSU), M. Siegel (PSU) and P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

Swift reobserved the field of GRB 130702A on July 4 and July 5 2013. 
We confirm the slow fading of the source first reported by Singer et al. (GCN Circ. 
14973) and previously reported in UVOT by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. 14973).
We also note that we detect the transient in all four of UVOT's NUV filters,
which is consistent with the low redshift reported by Leloudas et al. (GCN Circ. 14983)
and D'Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. 14984).

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et  
al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.04 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
