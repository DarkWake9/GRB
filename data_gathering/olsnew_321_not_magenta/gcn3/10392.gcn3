J. Mao (YNAO & INAF-OAB), D. Wang  and J. Bai (YNAO) report on behalf of 
the GMG group:
 
Starting 14h 44m UT, after more than 1 hour of the trigger, we observed 
the field of GRB 100206A (Krimm et al., GCN 10376) with one 2.4-m 
telescope located at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG). We did not see the afterglow in 
the R-band image with exposure time 20 min. However, the nearby 
galaxy(Miller et al. GCN 10377) were clearly detected, the magnitude is 
about R ~ 21.5 referenced to one USNO star.
