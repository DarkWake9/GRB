D. Xu, Z.P. Zhu, X. Liu, H.J. Wang, L. Ge (NAOC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200215A (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) 
using the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT). Observations 
started at 05:02:05 UT on 2020-02-16 (i.e., 14.38 hr after the BAT 
trigger), and 3600 s H-band imagining was obtained.

No afterglow is detected within the Enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et 
al., GCN 27089) in our stacked image down to a limiting magnitude of H~20.0.

 From the PanSTARRS archive, there exists an extended object outside and 
south to the Enhanced XRT error circle by ~5.1 arcsec, as reported in 
Kann & de Ugarte Postigo (GCN 27083). It's thus dubbed PS021619+124609 
here. As the GRB field is in the previous UKIRT H-band survey, we 
performed photometry of PS021619+124609 in both epochs. Any significant 
brightening for PS021619+124609 is ruled out, and we're inclined to 
think it is not related to the GRB.

We thank the great support of the UKIRT staff, in particular Michael Pohlen.
