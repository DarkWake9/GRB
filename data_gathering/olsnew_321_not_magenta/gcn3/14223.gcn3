C. A. Swenson (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:15:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130216A (trigger=548927).  Swift did not slew because 
of the Moon observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 67.898, +14.665 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 31m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 39' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a small precursor 
peak at T-6 sec, and then the main peak at T+2 sec
with a total duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~10,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 13:16 UT on 2013 February 20. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Melandri (andrea.melandri AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
