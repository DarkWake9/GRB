R. Subrahmanyan (ATNF), S.J. Cunningham (ATNF), M.H. Wieringa (ATNF), 
D. A. Frail (NRAO) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

"We obtained a 12 hour integration with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) centered on July 6.33 UT at 4.8 GHz and 8.6 GHz.
The ATCA was pointed at the BeppoSAX WFC position of GRB 990705 as 
given by Frontera (BeppoSAX mail #99/17).

Within the 3-arcmin WFC error circle there are three sources above 5
sigma, the last two of these lie within the 2-arcmin NFI error circle
(Gandolfi, GCN 373). We report these positions for the purpose of
enabling observations at other wavelengths. We are making no claims at
this time that any of these sources are the afterglow from GRB 990705.
Further ATCA observations are planned to determine which, if any, of
these sources are variable."
