The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:31:12 UT on 17 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220617A (trigger 677183477.902462 / 220617772).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 155.8, Dec = 21.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 23m, 21d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 41.0 degrees.
