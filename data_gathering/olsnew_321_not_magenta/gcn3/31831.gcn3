The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:47:23 UT on 4 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220404B (trigger 670787248.326908 / 220404741).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 25.6, Dec = -10.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 42m, -10d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 38.0 degrees.
