report on behalf of the GOTO collaboration:


In response to the short-duration GRB 180626B (GCN 22863, 22866), the
Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) observed the IPN
triangulation region as reported in Hurley et al. (GCN 22863).

Observations were spread over several telescope array pointings,
beginning 2018-06-26T21:52 UT (20.1 hours after the burst) and
employed sets of 3x120s exposures in our wide L filter (400-700nm).
Approximately 83% of the IPN region was covered on-chip. These fields
were repeated in subsequent nights to permit difference imaging
analysis and typically achieved a 5 sigma limiting magnitude of
V=19.9-20.1 (based on zeropoints derived from APASS crossmatching).

We made use of the GLADE galaxy catalog to pay particular attention to
possible source candidates near galaxies within 200 Mpc. No
significant sources that could be credibly associated with the GRB were
detected.

GOTO is operated at the La Palma observing facilities of the
University of Warwick on behalf of a consortium including the
University of Warwick, Monash University, Armagh Observatory, the
University of Leicester, the University of Sheffield, the National
Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT) and the Instituto
de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC)
