The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:00:05 UT on 4 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200604A (trigger 612993610.010234 / 200604833).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 179.5, Dec = -3.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 58m, -3d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54.0 degrees.
