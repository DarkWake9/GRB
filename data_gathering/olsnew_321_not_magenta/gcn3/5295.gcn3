Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060708 (trigger #217805)
(Moretti, et al., GCN 5292).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA,Dec = 7.830,-33.752 deg {0h 31m 19.2s, -33d 45' 7.7"} (J2000) +- 1.0 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-tagged lightcurve shows a single, roughly triangular peak
starting at T-2 sec, peaking at T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+9 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.8 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.3 to T+14.2 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.68 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.0 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.11 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 2.0 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
