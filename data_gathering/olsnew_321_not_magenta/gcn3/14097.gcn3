We observed GRB121217A (GCN 14809) with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array at 44GHz for 90 minutes centered on 12:55UT Dec 21 2012
(T0+4.234days) in poor weather.

We detect no radio source at the optical location of the GRB (GCN
14091) and place a 3sigma upper limit of 0.6mJy on the flux of an
afterglow.

These observations were obtained as part of ATCA project C2689. We
thank the observatory staff for their support and scheduling the
observations. The Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of
Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
