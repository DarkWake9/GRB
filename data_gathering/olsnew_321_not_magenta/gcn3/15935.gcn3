report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 03:29:44.95 UT on 06 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140306A (trigger 415769387/140306146).
The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 31.3 , DEC = +45.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 02h 05m, +45d 54.0'), with an uncertainty
of 1.00  degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The initial angle from the Fermi LAT boresight was 61  degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several peak
with a duration (T90) of about 68 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.21601 s to T0+69.6s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.10 +/- 0.01   and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1580 +/- 100   keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.9 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+6.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 11.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
