of the Swift Team:

At 12:09:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071013 (trigger=294120).  Swift did not execute an immediate slew. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA, Dec 279.525, +33.857 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 38m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 51' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a peak ~40 sec duration. 
The peak count rate was ~800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

There are no XRT or UVOT data products because auto-slewing to new bursts
is disabled while in gyro-calibration mode. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
