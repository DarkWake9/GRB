collaboration:

The 0.4m WATCHER telescope located at Boyden Observatory,
South Africa, has observed the field of GRB 080514B (Rapisarda
et al., GCN 7715) starting at May 15.042 UT (~15.1 hours after
the burst) in a sequence of 120s R band exposures. A combined
image covering ~90% of the error box does not show any new
source down to a limiting magnitude of R>19 at a mean epoch of
May 15.076 UT.

Further analysis is ongoing.
