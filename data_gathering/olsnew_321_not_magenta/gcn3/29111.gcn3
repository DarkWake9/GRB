P. Veres (UAH) reports:

In GCN 29110 we reported the sub-threshold detection of GRB 201221A. The
reported fluence  value contained an error. The corrected paragraph reads:

"
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in the T0-10 s to T0+47 s time interval (T0
is the Swift trigger time) is (3.6 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. Using the
redshift z=5.7 reported by Malesani et al (GCN 29100),  we derive an
isotropic equivalent energy in the 1-10,000 keV range of (2.2 +/- 0.2)E+53
erg.
"

We apologize for the confusion this may have caused.
