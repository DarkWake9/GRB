A very bright hard short GRB triggered the Konus-Wind instrument
at T0=33943.785 s UT (09:25:43.785) on November 3. 
It was also observed by HETE-Fregate, Mars Odyssey (GRS and HEND), 
RHESSI, and Swift-BAT.

We have triangulated this burst to the 3sigma
confidence error box:

                   RA(2000) Dec(2000)
----------------------------------------
ERROR BOX CENTER:   148.142 68.845

ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 148.563 69.189 
ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 147.570 68.115
ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 147.731 68.499
ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 148.738 69.564
---------------------------------------

The area of the error box is 120 sq. arcmin.

The error box is consistent with a source in M81.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a duration of 0.17 sec,
fluence 2.34(-0.28, +0.31)10^-5 erg/cm2,
and peak flux on 2ms time scale 1.89 (-0.35, +0.25)10^-3 erg/cm2/sec
(both in 20 keV - 10 MeV range).
The Epeak of the time-integrated spectrum is 1920 +/- 400 keV.
Assuming this burst originated from a source in M81 (D = 4 Mpc),
the isotrpoic energy release of this GRB is ~4.5x10^46 erg,
which consistent with the energy release of
27 December giant flare from SGR 1806-20.

The peak flux of this GRB is the largest ever observed for
the Konus-Wind short GRBs.

The burst light curve had a very steep rise ~4 msec and a decaying tail,
similar to the initial pulses of SGR giant flares.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
