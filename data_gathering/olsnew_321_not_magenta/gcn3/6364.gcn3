P. Schady (MSSL/PSU) and J. Cannizzo (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift UVOT team:

Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 070429A starting 211s after the 
BAT trigger. No new source is detected either within the refined XRT 
position (GCN 6363) or at the position reported by Ugarte Postigo et 
al. (GCN 6361) in any of the UVOT filters, in either single or co-added 
exposures. The 3-sigma upper limits for the co-added exposures in each 
filter are as follows:

Filter        T_mid       Exp.     Mag 3-sig UL
                      (s)           (s)
White       850          253      19.43
V               1104       903      19.75
B               1700       107      19.30
U               1598       117      18.96
UVW1      3535        259     19.19
UVM2       3951       333     19.61
UVW2      1659        117     19.07

where T_mid is the weighted mid time of the co-added images. The 
reported upper limits are uncorrected for the estimated Galactic 
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.17 mag.
