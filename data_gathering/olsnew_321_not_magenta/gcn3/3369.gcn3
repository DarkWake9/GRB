TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3369
SUBJECT: GRB050416A : 1 GHz limit from GMRT
DATE:    05/05/06 12:25:56 GMT
FROM:    Resmi L at Raman Res.Inst./India  <resmi@rri.res.in>

C. H. Ishwara-Chandra (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, Pune,
India), A. P. Kamble and L. Resmi (Raman Research Institute, Bangalore,
India) report on behalf of a larger GRB collaboration:

We observed the GRB050416A field (GCN 3268) on 25th April 2005 (UT 17:30
to 22:20) with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 1280MHz. We do not
detect any source within the 5" error circle of the Swift XRT. At the
position of the VLA source reported by Soderberg et. al. (GCN 3318) we
place a 2 sigma upper limit of 94 micro Jansky.

This message may be cited.

[GCN OPS NOTE;  This circular was delayed 2 hrs until an account could be set up.]
