TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3268
SUBJECT: GRB 050416: Swift XRT Position

J. A. Kennea, J. L. Racusin, D. N. Burrows (PSU), V. Mangano 
(IASF/Palermo), T. Sakamoto (GSFC/NRC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on 
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 11:04:45 UT on 16th April 2005 
(GCN Circ 3264). The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT 
position and the XRT began taking data at 11:06:03 UT.  The XRT was in 
Auto state but was not able to centroid on the afterglow due to low source 
brightness. From downlinked data we find a uncataloged fading X-ray source 
located at:

RA(J2000) = 12:33:54.6,
Dec(J2000) = +21:03:24.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This 
position is 49 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3264, and 
2.7 arcseconds from the P60 optical afterglow candidate reported in GCN 
3265.
