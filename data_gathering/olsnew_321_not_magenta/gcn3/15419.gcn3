Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ARTEMIS),
Boer M., Siellez K., Dereli H., Bardho O. (UNS-CNRS-OCA),
Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131030A detected by SWIFT (trigger 576238, 
Troja et al. GCN 15402) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 2.85h after the GRB trigger. The elevation of 
the field increased from 59 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We clearly detected the fading counterpart mentioned by previous teams 
(Virgili et al., GCN 15406, Strob et al. GCN 15410) from T0+2.85h to 
T0+9.13h
