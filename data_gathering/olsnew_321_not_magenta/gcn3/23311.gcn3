R. Martone, C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C.G. Mundell 
(U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Cucchiara, 
D. Morris (U. of Virgin Islands) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

We automatically began observing Swift GRB 181010A (Melandri et al. GCN 
23309) with one LCO 1-m unit at Cerro Tololo from October 10, 06:02:54 
UT (corresponding to 7.1 minutes from the GRB trigger time) with the 
SDSS r' filter. We clearly detect the optical counterpart reported by 
Swift-UVOT with r'=19.98 +- 0.12 mag from a 3x120s exposure at a mid 
time of 10.7 minutes post GRB, as calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS 
objects.
