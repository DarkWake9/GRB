Kuntal Misra and S. B. Pandey (ARIES) report:

We carried out the follow-up observations of GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu, et
al., GCN 31347) using 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at
Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational
sciencES (ARIES), India. The observation was started on  2022-01-01 at
12:45:02 UT. We observed a series of images with an exposure time of 300
seconds in R band covering Swift UVOT position and that provided by other
optical observations (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31347; Kuin & Tohuvavohu, GCN
31351; Fu et al., GCN 31353; Hentunen et al., GCN 31356; Perley et al., GCN
31357; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 31358; Fynbo et al., GCN 31359; Vinko
et al., GCN 31361; Tomasella et al., GCN 31363; Mao et al., GCN 31364;
Noschese et al., GCN 31366; Mao et al., GCN 31368; Guelbenzu et al., GCN
31370; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 31371). An uncataloged source is clearly
visible at the location of the burst with a magnitude of 18.19+-0.15 in the
R-band at around 7.73 hours after the burst.

Photometry is done based on the USNO-B1.0 catalog. The magnitude is not
corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
