Using the data set from T-120 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080328 (trigger
#307931) (Perri, et al., GCN Circ. 7525).  The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA, Dec = 80.490, 47.523 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  05h 21m 57.7s
    Dec(J2000) = +47d 31' 23.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.

The mask-weighted light curve consists of about about ten major pulses
spread over ~100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 90.6 +- 1.5 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.2 to T+117.5 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.52 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
9.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+9.3 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 5.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
