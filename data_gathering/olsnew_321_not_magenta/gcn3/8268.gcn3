A. Rossi (Tautenburg Obs.), T. Kruehler, J. Greiner, A. Yoldas,
C. Clemens, R. Filgas (all MPE Garching), A. Kupcu Yoldas (ESO)
and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest), report on behalf of
the GROND team:

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), mounted at the
2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile), started
observations of the field of GRB 080915A (Oates et al. GCN #8227)
in g'r'i'z'JHK at 00:07:25 UT on 2008-09-15, 4.6 minutes after the burst
and continued for 130 minutes.

The observations were resumed in the following night, starting at
05:18:45 UT and continued for 70 minutes.

We detect 2 sources, one inside the XRT error circle (Evans et al.GCN #8231)
at coordinates RA, DEC (J2000) = 01:11:47.83, -76:01:13.7,
the other at the edge of the XRT error circle at coordinates
RA, DEC (J2000) = 01:11:45.4, -76:01:10.5.

A comparison of the two observing runs does not reveal any evidence for
variability. We conclude that most likely none of them is associated with
GRB 080915A.

The co-added images from the first run then yield the following upper
limits measured at a mid-time of 0.038 days after the trigger and
calibrated on the SDSS standard star SA95-190:

g' > 23.8
r' > 23.7
i' > 23.5
z' > 23.1
J  > 20.5
H  > 19.3
K  > 18.3
