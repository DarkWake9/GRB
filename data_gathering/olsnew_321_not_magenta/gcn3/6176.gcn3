SUBJECT: GRB070306: confirmation of near infrared afterglow
DATE:    07/03/07 04:29:30 GMT
FROM:    Evert Rol at U.Leicester  <er45@star.le.ac.uk>

A.  Levan  (Warwick),  E.  Rol  (Leicester),  N.  Tanvir  (Leicester),
M. Schirmer (ING) and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on behalf
of a larger collaboration, report:

We have  re-observed  the location of GRB 070306  (Pandey et al., GCNC
6169) with  WHT+LIRIS, in  K-band. Observations  started at  00:39 UT,
7.97  hours after the  trigger.  Comparison  with our  previous K-band
observation  (Rol et  al., GCNC  6174) shows  the  suggested candidate
afterglow  to  have increased  in  brightness  by  about a  magnitude,
confirming it  to be variable and  the near infrared  afterglow of GRB
070306. Further observations are strongly encouraged.

[GCN OPS NOTE(07mar07): Per author's request, the typo in the Subject
was changed from "070603" to "070306".]
