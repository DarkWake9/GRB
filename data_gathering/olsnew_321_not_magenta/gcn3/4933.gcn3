P. Romano (INAF-OAB) and L. Vetere (ASDC) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 01:28:03 UT 29 March 2006, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) triggered and located a bright burst from SGR 1900+14
(trigger=203109).  Swift was already pointed at this
Soft Gamma-ray Repeater and taking data with the XRT and UVOT.
The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 286.802, +9.329 {19h 07m 12s, +09d 19' 43"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty), consistent with the known SGR location
(1 arcmin).  The BAT light curve shows a single intense spike of
width 128 ms with 15,000 counts in the brightest 128 ms bin
(15-100 keV) with no evidence for emission above 100 keV.

This marks the 13th and brightest identified burst from this
source in its current episode of activity, and the 6th to
occur during pointed observations.
