We have analysed 6.6 ks of XRT data for GRB 180620B (Evans et al. GCN
Circ. 22807), from 89 s to 56.0 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 237 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 22814).

The late-time light curve (from T0+4.3 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.61 (+/-0.08).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.34 (+/-0.05). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.30 (+/-0.15) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.99 (+0.11, -0.10)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.6 (+/-0.3) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.5 x 10^-11 (4.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.6 (+/-0.3) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 7.9 sigma
Photon index:	     1.99 (+0.11, -0.10)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.61, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.12 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.1 x
10^-12 (5.5 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
