MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB 210708B ( B. Sbarufatti et al., GCN 30417) errorbox  27094 sec after notice time and 27800 sec after trigger time at 2021-07-08 21:06:45 UT, with upper limit up to  16.5 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith distance = 79 deg. The sun  altitude  is -13.0 deg. 

MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope  located in Argentina (OAFA observatory of San Juan National University) was pointed to the Swift GRB 210708B errorbox  34540 sec after notice time and 35247 sec after trigger time at 2021-07-08 23:10:51 UT, with upper limit up to  17.2 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 77 deg. The sun  altitude  is -17.6 deg. 

The galactic latitude b = 42 deg., longitude l = 218 deg.
