Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), and Atteia, J.L. (LAT-OMP) report:

We imaged the entire field of GRB 051221B (173904) detected by SWIFT
(Boyd et al. GCNC 4376) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) located at
the Calern observatory, France. Observations started 9 seconds after the GCN
notice (and 216 sec. after the GRB). The field had an elevation of 35
degrees above horizon at the beginning of the observations and then
decreased. The humidity was rather high (90%), and haze appeared after few
minutes of observation.

We compared the ± 1.6 arcmin field centred on the XRT position (Fenimore et al.
GCNC 4382) with stars of the USNO-B1 catalogue and with the DSS2-R atlas. We
did not find any new source. Following is the observation log and the upper
limits we derived:
