Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190114A (trigger #883600)
(LaPorte et al., GCN Circ. 23677).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 65.543, 2.196 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  04h 22m 10.2s
  Dec(J2000) = +02d 11' 45.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows some weak-overlapping pulses that start
at ~T+125 s and end at ~T+200 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 66.6 +- 10.2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+126.40 to T+199.22 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.06 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.0 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+151.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
