The position of GRB060806 (Hurley et al. GCN 5416) is consistent
with that of SGR1806-20, and the spectrum of this burst is soft.
Therefore the origin of this event is almost certainly SGR1806-20,
which has been active recently.  This type of bursting behavior
appears to be unique, however, so observations at other wavelengths are
encouraged.
