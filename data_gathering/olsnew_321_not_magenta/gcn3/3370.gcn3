SUBJECT: GRB050505: AAVSO observations

D. Hohman (Stone Edge Observatory), A. Henden (AAVSO) and A. Price (AAVSO) 
report on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy Network on
optical observations of GRB050505 (GCN #3360, Hurkett et al.):

No afterglow candidate is found in the field or at the location of
the afterglow reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 3366) to a limiting
unfiltered (R-like) magnitude of 18.5 using USNO-A2.0 reference
stars. Observation midpoint time was 02:19 UT on May 6, 2005
(2.9hrs after burst). Details of the observation are below along
with a link to the FITS image.  The unfiltered observations have
significant Rc/Ic contribution and so are complementary to the
UVOT observations reported by Rosen, et al. (GCN 3367).
