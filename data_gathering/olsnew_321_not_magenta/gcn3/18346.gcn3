Swift has performed further observations of the error region of advanced
LIGO trigger G184098. The previously-reported observations covered 8
galaxies within the error region, listed below; the typical upper limit
from these observations is 2.6e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV).
Subsequently a 37-point tiled observation has been performed, covering a
portion of the LMC within the GW error region, centred on RA,Dec =
103.8877, -68.3023 (06h 55m 33.04s, -68d 18' 08.3"), with ~60 s exposure
per tile. No X-ray sources were found in these observations. The upper
limits from these observations range from 3.3e-12 to 1.3e-11 erg cm^-2
s^-1 (0.3-10 keV).

The galaxies covered by the original observations were:
ESO089-015
ESO089-016
ESO088-018
ESO088-017
PGC298845
ESO126-002
ESO126-004
ESO089-009
ESO090-011
PGC314417

Details of these observations have been uploaded to the GraceDB.
