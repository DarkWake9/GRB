Julie McEnery (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi LAT team

We report a detection by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) of 
emission from GRB081215A (Preece et al, GCN8678).

This burst was at an angle of 86 degrees to the LAT boresight, which 
means that neither directional nor energy information can be obtained 
with the standard analysis procedures.

Using a non-standard data selection, over 100 counts above background 
were detected within a 0.5 s interval in coincidence with the main GBM 
peak. The significance of this excess was greater than 8 sigma. A 
preliminary study of the instrument performance at such a large 
inclination suggests that these events are likely to be low energy 
gamma-rays, with energies less than 200 MeV.

Further analysis is ongoing.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Julie McEnery 
(julie.mcenery@nasa.gov).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an 
international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many 
scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
