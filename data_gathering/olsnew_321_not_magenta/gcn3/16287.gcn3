A. Pozanenko (IKI),  report on  behalf of larger collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 140516A (Bernardini et al., GCN 16285) with 
ORI-40 (0.4-m f/3)  telescope of ISON-Kislovodsk observatory. Observations 
started on  May 16 (UT) 20:39:04 and continued up to (UT) 21:11:60.   We 
obtained  several unfiltered images  of 30 s and 100 s exposures. In a 
preliminary analysis we do not detect evident source within XRT error circle 
(Bernardini et al., GCN 16285) .  The upper limit of a combined image is 
20.5m and based on USNO-B1.0 (R2) nearby stars.
