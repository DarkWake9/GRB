We observed the localization region of the gravitational wave trigger
S200213t (LVC, GCN #27042) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with
the 47 square degree Zwicky Transient Facility camera (ZTF, Bellm et al.
2019, Graham et al. 2019).

The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target
of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We
started obtaining target-of-opportunity observations in the g-band and
r-band beginning at 2020-02-13 04:36 UT, targeting ~77% of the enclosed
probability based on the bayestar skymap (LVC, GCN #27042). Each exposure
was 120s with a median depth of ~20.7 mag.

The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image
subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci
et al. 2019). Alert filtering and follow-up coordination was undertaken by
the GROWTH Marshal system (Kasliwal et al. 2019). The ZTF alert stream was
also queried using the Kowalski infrastructure (Duev et al., 2019). We
required at least 2 detections separated by at least 30 minutes to select
against moving objects. Furthermore, we cross-matched our candidates with
the Minor Planet Center to flag known asteroids. Candidates that passed our
selection are:

We encourage follow-up to classify the candidates. We caution that these
candidates are low Galactic latitude and the magnitudes reported are not
extinction corrected.
