(GWFUNC):

We have performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G275404 (LVC, GCN
20738) using the 1-m Chinese Near Earth Object Survey Telescope (CNEOST)
at Xuyi, Jiangsu, China.

CNEOST has a FOV of 3.0x3.0 deg^2, and carried out observations during
10:44:55.9 - 14:44:22.4 UT and 19:46:14.6 - 21:47:47.6 UT on 2017-02-26
in the Sloan r-filter. The skymap coverage is at

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3665676/G275404/skymap20170226NEOST.pdf

and the typical limiting magnitude is of m(r)~20.0 mag.

Preliminary analysis doesn't reveal optical transient brighter than
m(r)~17.5 mag that is positionally coincident with SDSS host galaxy
whose spectroscopic or photometric redshifts is < 0.1.
