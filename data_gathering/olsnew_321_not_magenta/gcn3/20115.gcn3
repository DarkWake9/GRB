The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161014A (Racusin et al., GCN 20035) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Oct 14.67, Oct 15.85, Oct 
17.85, and Oct 20.85 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Mingo et al., GCN 20050), with 3sigma upper limits of 225 uJy, 
285 uJy, 129 uJy, and 228 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
