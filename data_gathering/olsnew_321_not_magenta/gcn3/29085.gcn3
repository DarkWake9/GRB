M. Shrestha (Liverpool JMU), A. Melandri (INAF), R. Smith (LJMU) , I.A. Steele (LJMU), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C. Mundell (Univ. Bath), A. Gomboc (Univ. Nova Gorica), C. Guidorzi (Univ. Ferrara)  report on behalf of a wider collaboration:



We observed the field of Swift GRB 201216C (GCN 29061) with the 2.0m Liverpool Telescope (LT), La Palma on 2020 Dec 16 starting at 23:10:29.13 UT using the IO:O optical camera in the r’ bands.  Data was calibrated with respect to nearby APASS secondary standard stars.



We confirm the optical counterpart reported by Swift UVOT and VLT (GCN 29066).



At T=177 seconds after the BAT trigger time, we measure r’ = 18.38. The r’ band light curve made along with VLT (GCN 29066) data point and inferred data from FRAM-ORM (GCN 29070) show a power law decay in flux vs time with alpha = 1. From the light curve, LT observations seem to be around the peak of afterglow.
