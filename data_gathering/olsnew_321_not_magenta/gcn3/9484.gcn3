The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), India observed the field of
GRB090424 (GCN 9223, GCN 9260) on 23 May 2009 (between 11.0 UT
and 15.0 UT i.e. about 30 days after the burst) at 1280 MHz using a
bandwidth of 32 MHz. The radio transient was not detected down
to a 3-sigma upper limit of 141 microJy at the source location.

staff. This TOO was done under the GMRT Director's Discretionary Time.
GMRT is run by NCRA-TIFR, Pune (INDIA).
