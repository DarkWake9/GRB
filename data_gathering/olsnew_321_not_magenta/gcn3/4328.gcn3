TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4328
SUBJECT: GRB 051211B: a possible optical detection by TAROT
DATE:    05/12/12 00:22:43 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), and Atteia, J.L. (LAT-OMP) report:

We imaged the entire field of GRB 051211b (trig 2712) detected by INTEGRAL
(Mereghetti et al. GCNC 4327) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France. Observations started 9
seconds after the GCN notice (and 28.7 s after the GRB). The field
had an elevation of 43 degrees above horizon at the begining of the
observations.

The sky was covered by clouds except for only one unfiltered image started on
2005-12-11T22:08:29.51 (GRB+131s) and ended on 2005-12-11T22:08:59.51
(GRB+161s). On this image, we detect a candidate for the afterglow
of the GRB at R ~ 16.2 +/- 0.6 :

RA  =  23 02 48.9
DEC = +55 05 06.0
J2000.0

This object is not seen on the DSS2-R, nor on the 2MASS-K, nor
in the USNO-B1.
