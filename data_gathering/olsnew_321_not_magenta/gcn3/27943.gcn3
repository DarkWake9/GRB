Z.P. Zhu, X. Liu, S.Y. Fu, D. Xu, J. Zheng, A.Y. Zhou (NAOC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200613A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 27926; 
Bissaldi et al., GCN 27930; Ohno et al., GCN 27931) using the 
Xinglong-2.16m telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera. Observations 
were carried out starting at 12:44:18 UT on 2020-06-14, and 5x300s 
R-band frames were obtained.

The previously reported afterglow (e.g., Kann et al., GCN 27935; Kennea 
et al., GCN 27936; Pozanenko et al., GCN 27937; Izzo et al., GCN 27939) 
is clearly detected in our stacked image, with R = 19.45 +/- 0.05 mag 
(at Tmid-T0 = 1.266 days post-burst), calibrated with nearby Pan-STARRS1.
