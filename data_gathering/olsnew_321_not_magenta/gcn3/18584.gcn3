Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We observed the position of the Fermi-LAT transient detected in the error
region of LIGO/Virgo G194575 (Vianello et al. GCN 18458) with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its D configuration. The observations were
carried out in S band (3 GHz; primary beam ~15 arcmin), started on
5-Nov-2015 22:09:18 UT, and ended on 5-Nov-2015 23:09:05. We obtained 5
images centered at the positions listed below (all located within the
Fermi/LAT 0.5 deg statistical error circle). Although the VLA calibration
pipeline failed in some of the data quality scores, careful inspection and
flagging allowed us to obtain calibrated images. Further observations are
planned: we will attempt to use the images collected during this first
epoch as references for identifying variable sources in the imaged area.
