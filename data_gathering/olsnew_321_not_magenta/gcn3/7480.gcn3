N. R. Tanvir, P. T. O'Brien, J. Osborne and P. Evans (U. Leicester) note:

We note here is an SDSS source in the centre of the UVOT enhanced
XRT error circle (GCN 7479).  The source is reported as having r=22.38
and a photometric redshift estimate of z=0.35+/-0.13 according to
the SDSS web site:

 http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/tools/explore/obj.asp?id=587731890577605599

A provisional analysis of Gemini-N/GMOS observations obtained about 90
mins post-burst also shows this source (at roughly the same magnitude),
but nothing else in the error circle.

If this is the host, then the photo-z is interestingly low, and the burst
interestingly faint in the optical.

Further analysis is ongoing.
