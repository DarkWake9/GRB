The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:06:45 UT on 15 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210515A (trigger 642776810.702128 / 210515546).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 117.1, Dec = 77.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 48m, 77d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 24.0 degrees.
