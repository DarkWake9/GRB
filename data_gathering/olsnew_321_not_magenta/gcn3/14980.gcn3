report:

We observed the field of GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967; Cheung et
al., GCN 14971; Collazzi & Connaughton, GCN 14972) with the Reionization
and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2013/07 4.16 to 2013/07 4.25 UTC (51.79 to 53.82 hours
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.42 hours exposure in the r'
and i' bands and 0.60 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

At the position of the source from Singer et al. (GCN 14967), in comparison
with SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

  r'    19.22 +/- 0.01
  i'    19.06 +/- 0.02
  Z    18.85 +/- 0.03
  Y    18.70 +/- 0.03
  J     18.72 +/- 0.03
  H    18.56 +/- 0.03

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Further observations are underway.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
