A.P. Beardmore, K.L. Page (U. Leicester), H. Ziaeepour and M. de Pasquale
(MSSL/UCL) report on behalf of the Swift team:

At 2008-02-12 16:42:52UT the Swift-XRT started a TOO observation of the 
IPN burst GRB 080211 (Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 7295), some 33.3 hours 
after the trigger. The observation lasted only 656 s, at which point it 
was terminated by the Swift discovery of GRB 080212 (Ziaeepour et al., GCN 
Circ. 7296).

The photon counting mode image accumulated during this time shows no 
evidence for a source in the XRT field of view, though only ~3/4 of the 
IPN error box was sampled. The 3 sigma limiting count rate for a point 
source in the XRT image is 0.009 count s^-1, which corresponds to a 
0.3-10.0 keV flux limit of 5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a power-law 
spectrum of photon index 2 absorbed by the Galactic column density of 
7.8e21 cm^-2 in the direction of the burst).

The IPN field was also observed by the Swift-UVOT in the UW1 filter only, 
for an exposure of 646 s. The 3 sigma upper limit is UW1 > 20.3. We note 
that the background in this field is very noisy and the extinction is 
highly variable throughout the field due to the presence of gas and dust 
visible in DSS images.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT and UVOT teams.
