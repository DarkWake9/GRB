team, report:

Konus-Wind and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) have so far observed the long bright
GRB 090328 (McEnery et al. GCN 9044). We have triangulated this
burst to a Konus-SPI-ACS annulus centered at RA(2000),
Dec(2000) =26.911, +1.465, whose radius is 72.339 +/-  0.671 degrees (3 
sigma).
This annulus intersects the GBM localization, and the LAT localization
lies 0.357 degrees from the center line of this annulus. A map is
posted at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB090328_T34609/IPN/
showing the GBM contours (statistical) and best-fit position (diamond),
the IPN annulus (solid line), and the LAT best-fit position (diamond)
and error circle (68% CL, statistical).

This map will also be posted at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/090328 .

The IPN localization may be improved.
