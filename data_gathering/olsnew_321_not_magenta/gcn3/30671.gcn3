The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:40:28 UT on 21 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210821A (trigger 651224433.594692 / 210821320).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 49.3, Dec = -6.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 17m, -6d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 87.0 degrees.
