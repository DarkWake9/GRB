J. Gropp (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We provide an update on the XRT light curve evolution of the candidate
X-ray afterglow of GRB 200517A (GCN Circ. 27750).

The XRT light curve now comprises data up to 300 ks from the MAXI trigger
(GCN Circs. 27750). There is a firm indication of fading with respect to
the first observation as reported previously (GCN Circ 27754), with a decay
index of 1.04 (+0.21, -0.18). We thus confirm that this is indeed the
afterglow of GRB 200517A.
