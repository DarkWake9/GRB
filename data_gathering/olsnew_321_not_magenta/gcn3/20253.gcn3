and the CALET collaboration:

We have performed a search for an X-ray and a gamma-ray counterpart
using the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data around the on-set
of the very-high-energy neutrino candidate IceCube-161210
(Blaufuss, GCN Circ. 20247).  The position of the IceCube event at the
event time was inside the field of view of HXM (the incident angle
was 48 deg) and SGM (the incident angle was 51 deg).

No CGBM on-board trigger happened around the IceCube event time.  By using
the CGBM time-history data (0.125 s time resolution), we found no significant
signal between +-30 s from the IceCube event time.  We estimate 7-sigma upper
limit of SGM in the 50-1000 keV band as 5.6 x 10^-7 erg cm^-2 s^-1 assuming a
single power-law model with a photon index of -2 in 1 s exposure.

All the quoted values are preliminary and subject to change by a further
analysis.

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
