After analysis of the full data set for Swift-BAT trigger 155764
at 19:42:13 UT on 18 Sep 2005 (Grupe et al, GCN 3999),
we have determined that this event is not due to a GRB or any
other astrophysical source.  The trigger arose from a chance
coincidence between a rate increase due to noise and a
positive fluctuation in the image.

XRT observed the field of trigger 155764 for 2 orbits for a total
of 4.2 ks. Ground-based analysis showed no source in the field.
No further observations are planned.

[GCN OPS NOTE(18sep05): Per one of the author's request, the trigger number
was corrected in the second paragraph.]
