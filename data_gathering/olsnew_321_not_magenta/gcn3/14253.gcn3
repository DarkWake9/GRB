The long GRB 130219A (Collazzi, GCN 14243; Hurley et al., GCN 14246) was
detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2013/02/19 18:35:51.73 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve exhibited two separated pulses; which are
the 1st short pulse from T0+1 s to T0+3 s,
and the following 2nd long pulse from T0+74 s to T0+96 s,
with a total duration of 96 s. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was
2.06 (+0.16/-0.36) x 10^-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux measured from
T0+81 s was 5.03 (+0.57/-0.72) photons/cm^2/s in 100 - 1000 keV.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-2s to
T0+98s is marginally described as a power-law with exponential cutoff
model:
dN/dE ~ E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
alpha 1.23(-0.45 +0.39), and
Epeak 502(-96 +151) keV (chi^2/d.o.f. = 33.2/24).

On the other hand, the two separate pulse spectra are well fitted
by different models. The 1st pulse spectrum is well fitted by a single
power-law with a photon index of 2.12(+0.57/-0.37) (chi^2/d.o.f = 21.6/25).
The 2nd pulse spectrum is well fitted by a GRB Band model:
  the low-energy photon index alpha: -1.16(-0.35 +0.49),
  the high-energy photon index beta: -2.5(fixed),
  and the peak energy Epeak: 515(-84, +145) keV (chi^2/d.o.f = 26.1/24).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
  in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
