Jay Cummings reports on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory team

Ground data analysis shows that Swift trigger 809374 (Cummings et al. GCN
Circ # 22406) was an artifact due to incomplete subtraction of the nearby
bright source Cyg-X1, and was not due to any new astrophysical source.

[GCN OPS NOTE(12feb18): The trigger number was changed from 809371 to 809374.]
