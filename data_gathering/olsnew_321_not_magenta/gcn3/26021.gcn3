Observatory Team:

At 14:36:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191017B (trigger=929981).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 245.151, -73.561 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 20m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 33' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 8 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 14:37:50.7 UT, 103.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 245.1255, -73.5404
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 16h 20m 30.13s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 32' 25.3"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 78 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (9.84 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3
(+3.00/-2.59) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 301 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.11.
