and KONUS GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin, on
behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus, Mars Odyssey (HEND), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this
event (GCN 1941).  We confirm that this is indeed a gamma-ray
burst.  Because the burst arrived along a direction close
to the Konus-Mars vector, the triangulation annulus is imprecise.
It is centered at RA, Decl = 280.256, -23.488 degrees, and
has a radius 11.122 +/- 0.456 degrees.  This annulus is consistent
with, but does not constrain, the IBIS localization in GCN 1941.
Ulysses data are expected within 24 hours, and may improve this
triangulation.
