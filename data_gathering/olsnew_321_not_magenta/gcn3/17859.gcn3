Atish Kamble, Alicia Soderberg and Raffaella Margutti (Harvard University)
report:

We observed the position of the soft-long GRB 150518A (Kawamuro et al., GCN
17825) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2015 May
21.12 UT (2.23 days after the burst) at the mean frequency of 6.0 GHz. In
this hour long observation, we detect a faint radio source at the position:

RA: 15 36 48.25
DEC: 16 19 46.82

with an average positional uncertainty of 0.01 arcsec. The VLA is currently
operating in BnA configuration. The radio afterglow position is consistent
with that reported by the Swift-XRT (Sbarufatti et al. GCN 17827).

We measure a 6.0 GHz flux density of the afterglow to be ~222 +/- 7
microJy. This flux density is comparable to that reported by the Arcminute
Microkelvin Imager (Anderson et al. GCN 17839).

Further multiband observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations.
