report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 10:24:18.51 UT on December 12, 2017, Fermi-LAT detected
high-energy emission from GRB 171212B, which was also detected by
Fermi-GBM (trigger 534767063 / 171212434).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 39.44, -70.62 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.39 deg
(90 % containment, statistical error only).

This was 11 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
that is spatially correlated with the trigger with high significance.
The highest-energy photon is a 931 MeV event which
is observed 544 seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Francesco Longo (francesco.longo@ts.infn.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
