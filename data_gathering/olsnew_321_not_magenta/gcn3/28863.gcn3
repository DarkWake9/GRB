J. Mao, C.-J. Wang, and J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:




We observed the field of GRB201103B/ZTF20acozryr/AT2020yxz with

the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan

Observatories once again. The observation began at UT 14:27:51, 7th,

Nov. 2020. We clearly detected the source, and the preliminary magnitude

is measured to be R~20.9. It seems that the source is fading very slightly.

We suggest to perform both photometric monitors to obtain the variability

behavior and spectral observations to obtain the possible spectral evolution

in the following nights.
