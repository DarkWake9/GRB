report:

GRB 151107B (Stanbro and Meegan, GCN 18570) was also observed by Konus-Wind
and Mars Odyssey-HEND.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered
at RA, Dec(2000) = 357.447, -2.630, whose radius is 55.156 +/- 0.054 degrees
(3 sigma).  The minimum distance between the center line of this annulus 
and the MASTER-NET optical transient (Lipunov et al., GCN 18576) is 3.22
degrees, supporting the conclusion that the OT and the GRB are indeed unrelated.
A map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/151107B.
