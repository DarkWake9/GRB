Using the data set from T-239 to T+340 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160121A (trigger #671231)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 18912).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 109.080, -23.590 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  07h 16m 19.1s
    Dec(J2000) = -23d 35' 25.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 91%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at T-4 sec,
peaking at T+3 sec and returning to baseline by T+14 sec. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 12.0 +- 2.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.03 to T+14.97 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.1 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.76 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
