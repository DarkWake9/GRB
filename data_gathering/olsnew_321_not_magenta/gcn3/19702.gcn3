T. Kruehler and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf of the
GROND team:

We re-observed the field of GRB 160712A (Swift trigger 704155; Hagen et
al., GCN #19684) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner
et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPG telescope at the
ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 04:38:43 UT on 2016-07-14, 32.8 hr after the GRB
trigger, and consisted of multiple exposures with a total integration
time of around 80 minutes. The average seeing and airmass were 2‚Äù.0 and
1.0, respectively.

Within photometric errors, no variability is detected with respect to
our earlier observations (GCN 19693, see also Troja et al. GCN 19695).
The source is hence unlikely to be the afterglow of GRB 160712A.
