I.A. Steele, M. Shrestha, S. Kobayashi (Liverpool JMU), C. Mundell (Univ. Bath), A. Gomboc (Univ. Nova Gorica) report on behalf of a wider collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 200410A (GCN 27518) with the 2.0m Liverpool Telescope, La Palma on 2020 Apr 10 starting at 02:28:38 UT using the IOO optical camera for a period of ~1 hour in the r’ and I’ bands. The target was well resolved from the two nearby stars.  Data was calibrated with respect to APASS secondary standard stars in the images.

We confirm the optical counterpart reported by Swift UVOT and Ondrejov (GCN 27520).

At T=155 seconds after the BAT trigger time, we measure r’ = 18.2.

Both the r’ and i’ band light curves subsequently show a power law decay in flux vs time with alpha = 0.7 over the first hour.
