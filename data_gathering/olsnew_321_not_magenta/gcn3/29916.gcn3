The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:42:17 UT on 30 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210430B (trigger 641511742.665196 / 210430904).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 348.2, Dec = 8.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 12m, 8d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 76.0 degrees.
