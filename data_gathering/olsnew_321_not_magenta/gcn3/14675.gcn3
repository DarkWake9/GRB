Nicola Omodei (Stanford) and Julie McEnery (GSFC) report on behalf of 
the Fermi-LAT team:

At 13:54:37.53 UT on 18 May 2013, Fermi LAT detected high energy 
emission from GRB 130518A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 
390578080 /130518580, GCN 14674).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be RA=355.809, DEC=47.641 
(J2000) with an error radius of 0.34 deg (68% containment, statistical 
error only).

The burst was about 43 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the 
trigger.
The data from the Fermi LAT shows emission lasting approximately 100 
seconds with a TS of 50.
Multi-peaked emission lasting roughly 40 seconds can be seen using the 
non-standard LAT Low Energy (LLE) with a significance of ~15 sigma.

A Swift TOO request has been submitted.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Sara Cutini 
(sara.cutini@asdc.asi.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an 
international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many 
scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
