behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:56:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091024 (trigger=373674).  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 339.207, +56.874 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 36m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +56d 52' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with the first peak at T=0 and a second smaller peak at T=40s 
with a total duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+50.0 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
