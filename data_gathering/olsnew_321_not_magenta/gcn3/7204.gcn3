SUBJECT: GRB 080123: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    08/01/23 10:46:03 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 390 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
V-band data for GRB 080123, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 338.94226, -64.90090 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 22h 35m 46.1s
Dec (J2000): -64d 54' 3.24"

with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest position
can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position enhancement is
described by Goad et al. (2007, astro-ph/0708.0986
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf).

This circular was automatically generated, and is an official product of the
