GRB 050607 : Lulin R-band observation

C.W. Chen (NCU), K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN), Y. Qiu
(BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

" We have imaged the entire error region of GRB 050607 (Retter et
al. GCN 3525) by using 1.0-m telescope at Lulin Observatory,
Taiwan. The R band observations started at 16.14 UT ( about 6.95 hours
after the burst). No source was detected at the X-ray afterglow
position ( Pagani et al. GCN 3528). The limiting magnitude of our R
band co-added image ( 300sec x 8) is 21.1 by comparing with USNOB1.0
stars.
