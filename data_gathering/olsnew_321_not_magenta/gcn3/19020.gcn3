Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160216A (trigger #673978)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 19014).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 311.679, -71.550 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 46m 43.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -71d 33' 01.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a small peak starting at ~T-0.3 sec,
then two large peaks at ~T+0.6 s and ~T+3.2 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 11.0 +- 1.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.30 to T+11.70 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.48 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.70 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.3 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
