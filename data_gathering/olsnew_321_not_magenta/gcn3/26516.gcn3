M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester), D.
M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 13:29:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191220A (trigger=945344).  Swift slewed immediately to the
burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA, Dec 281.391, +26.667 which is
   RA(J2000) = 18h 45m 34s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 40' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger.

The XRT began observing the field at 13:31:50.2 UT, 132.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 281.37924,
26.65599 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 45m 31.02s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 39' 21.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 54 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.53
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.03e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV).

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter
starting 137 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow
candidate has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7'
sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper
limit has been about 19.2 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 0.00% of the XRT error circle. No correction has
been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.14.
