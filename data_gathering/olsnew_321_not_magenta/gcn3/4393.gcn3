The bright and short burst, GRB 051221A (Parsons et al., GCN4363),
triggered by Swift/BAT was also detected with the Suzaku Wideband
All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy band of 50 keV - 5 MeV
at 01:51:16 (UT).
The observed light curve exhibits two intense short spikes
with a total duration (T90) of 0.22 sec. 
The fluence in 100 - 2000 keV was (2.4 +/- 0.4)X10^-6 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak flux was 4.7 +/- 0.8 photons/cm2/s in the 
same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum 
is well fitted by a single power law with a photon index 
of 1.95 +/- 0.18. 

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
The WAM onboard calibration is still under way, and 
systematic errors, such as the flux calibration uncertainties of
about 20%, are not included in the errors.

The WAM light curve of this event is available at

Further detailed analyses are in progress.
