The XRT began observing the field at 09:42:07 UT, 177 seconds after the 
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located 
at RA(J2000) = +03h 53m 32.5s, Dec(J2000) = +21d 29' 19.3", with an 
estimated uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). This 
location is 55 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within the BAT 
error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image was 6.7e-09 erg/cm2/s 
(0.2-10 keV).
