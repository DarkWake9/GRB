Using the data set from T-239 to T+394 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071010 (trigger #293707)
(Moretti, et al., GCN Circ. 6859).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 288.040, -32.385 deg  which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 12m 9.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 23' 6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 42%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-10 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.1 to T+5.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.33 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.80 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
