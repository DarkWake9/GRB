NUMBER:  16846
SUBJECT: GRB 140927A: Swift-UVOT analysis
DATE:    14/09/27 22:34:48 GMT
FROM:    Craig Swenson at PSU/Swift  <cswenson@astro.psu.edu>

C. Swenson (PSU) and R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

Analysis of the field of GRB 140927A shows a bright DSS source
located at RA, DEC= 291.79237,-65.39323, which is 1.7" from the
enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 16843). No elongation
or fading of the known source is observed in the first 10e4 seconds
of UVOT observations, meaning that any potential afterglow contribution
is being overpowered by the known source.
