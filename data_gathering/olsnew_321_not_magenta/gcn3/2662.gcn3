report:

At 16:21:37 UTC (58897 s UT) on 25 August 2004, the HETE FREGATE and
WXM instruments detected event GRB040825B (=H3510), a long XRF.
The burst triggered the WXM in the 2-30 keV energy band;  the burst
duration is roughly 80 seconds.  

A flight localization was automatically forwarded to the GCN 31 seconds 
after the trigger.  The flight localization was a circle of 14' radius 
centered at 

  RA = 22h 47m 22s,   Dec = -02d 19' 05" (J2000)

Subsequent analysis of the full data set allowed the burst error region
to be reduced to a 160 sq. arcmin error box with the following coordinates, 
distributed by GCN Notice 1.8 hours after the trigger:

  RA = 22h 46m 38.9s, Dec = -02d 33m 40
  RA = 22h 46m 01.9s, Dec = -02d 29m 17s
  RA = 22h 46m 28.6s, Dec = -02d 15m 14s
  RA = 22h 47m 05.5s, Dec = -02d 19m 41s

Preliminary spectral analyses show the burst spectrum is well fit by
a cutoff powerlaw model with an Epeak of 23 keV.  The burst fluence
is 1.3e-6 erg/cm2 in the 2-30 keV band, 6.3e-7 erg/cm2 in the 30-400 
keV band;  GRB040825B is therefore an XRF.
