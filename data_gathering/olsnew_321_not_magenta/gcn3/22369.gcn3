A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 538030981/180119210 at 05:02:56.30 UT 
on 19 January 2018, tentatively classified as a GRB, is in fact not due to a GRB. 
This trigger is due to local particles. 

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) 
by the GBM Flight Software owing to the high fluence of the particle event. 
This ARR was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location."
