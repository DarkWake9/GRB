Starting with the data taken ~113s after the BAT trigger
(Barbier et al, GCN 3314) we have co-added the data of
GRB 050422 in each of the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope
(UVOT) V, B and U bands.  The co-added image for the V-band
is made up of 1 x 100 s and 5 x 10 s exposures, the co-added
B-band and U-band images are made up of 5 x 10 s exposures.
The XRT error circle (Pagani et al., GCN 3315) falls
partially on a known source from the DSS.  No new source
is detected in any of the bands; we estimate the five
sigma magnitude upper limits from the co-added images to be:

Filter  Upper Limit  Duration(s)  T_start(s)  T_mid(s)
   V        17.9        148.7        112.9      374.1
   B        18.2         48.8        258.6      432.5
   U        17.8         48.8        244.5      418.0

Where T_start is time after trigger, and T_mid is the midpoint
of the summed exposure.

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured
in orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.

We note that the reddening in this direction is E_{B-V} = 1.4.
