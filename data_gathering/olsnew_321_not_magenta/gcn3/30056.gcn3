The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 21/05/19 UT IceCube issued an alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/135302_36915486.amon) reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of astrophysical origin. Upon further examination by the IceCube collaboration, the event is found to be likely due to atmospheric background and not a high energy astrophysical neutrino.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.
