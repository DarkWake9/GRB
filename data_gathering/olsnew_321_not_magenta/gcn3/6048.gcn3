D.T. Durig reports the following unfiltered (CR) magnitudes:

2007 Jan 27, 04:02:58 UT: 19.4 +/- 0.2 (CR)
2007 Jan 27, 05:08:10 UT: 19.7 +/- 0.2 (CR)
2007 Jan 27, 06:13:17 UT: 19.9 +/- 0.2 (CR)
2007 Jan 27, 07:27:28 UT: 20.0 +/- 0.2 (CR)

B. Gary reports the following unfiltered magnitudes:

2007 Jan 27, 06:22:12 UT: 19.58 +/- 0.12 (clear)
2007 Jan 28, 05:36:00 UT: 20.20 +/- 0.24 (clear)

-----------------------------

Observer: D. T. Durig, D. S. Hardage, N. M. Haymond, (CLW01)
Report: Afterglow is very faintly visible in single 120 sec images with
SNR 2.5 to 3.5. Very obvious in stacks of 10, 15 and 30 frames. Position
of 07 51 17.74 +31 09 04.1. Stacks of 30 frames gives SNR of 13 with
magnitude falling from 19.6 to 19.7 to 19.9 to 20.0 in each hour long
stack. We lost about 12 minutes in the last stack because we lost our
guide star, so intervals are slightly different. GIF image posted to

Observer: B. Gary
Report: One day later (2007.01.28, UT = 5.60) CV = 20.20 +/- 0.24. CV
for Jan 27 & 28 UT asssume B-V = +0.3. All SE errors are orthogonal sum
of stochastic and estimated systematic.
