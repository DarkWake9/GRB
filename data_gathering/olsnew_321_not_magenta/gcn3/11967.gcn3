 We observed GRB 110422A (Mangano et al. GCN 11957) with griz
filters using CQUEAN camera on the 2.1m telescope at the McDonald
observatory, TX. The observation started at 2011 April 23, 02:53:11 UT,
about 11.19 hours after the BAT trigger.
 We confirm a bright afterglow in all the griz images at the location
reported earlier (Xu et al. GCN 11961; Evans et al. GCN 11965), with
a preliminary photometry of r ~ 20.36 +- 0.05  AB mag, based on the
photometric standard star data taken on the same night.
 Further analysis of the data is ongoing.
