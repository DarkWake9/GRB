The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:41:24 UT on 8 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190508B (trigger 579051689.148352 / 190508987).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 103.5, Dec = 27.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 54m, 27d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 52.0 degrees.
