Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:


"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 080229 (GCN 7335) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 March
01.50 UT. We detect a radio source of flux density of 635 +/- 44
uJy at a position of
RA(J2000) 15 12 52.21984, DEC(J2000) -14 42 15.3000.
This is 2.82" away from the X-ray afterglow position determined by
Swift-XRT (GCN 7343).
