A. Melandri (INAF/OAB), C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara) and C. G. Mundell  
(LJMU) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

Tha Faulkes Telescope South robotically observed the field of GRB  
130803A starting ~ 2.9 minutes after the Swift trigger (Page et al.,  
GCN 15059). We find no credible afterglow candidate in the XRT error  
circle.

We estimate a 3 sigma upper limit of R>20.0 (texp=30s) ~3.5 minutes  
and I>21.9 (texp=700s) ~40 minutes after the burst.

Magnitudes are calibrated against nearby USNOB-1 stars.
