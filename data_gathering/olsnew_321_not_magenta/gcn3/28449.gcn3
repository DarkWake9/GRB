Swift observed the field of IceCube 200916A (GCN Circ. 28433) between 20:59:50 2020 September 16 and 01:26:43 on 2020 September 17, collecting a total of 3.7 ks of cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found no X-ray sources.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 5-8 x10^-3 ct/sec.
