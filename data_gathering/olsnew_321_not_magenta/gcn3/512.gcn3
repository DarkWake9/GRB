K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline and E. Mazets,
on behalf of the KONUS-WIND and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, KONUS-WIND, and NEAR observed a moderately intense
(25-100 keV fluence ~10^-5 erg/cm^2), 100 s long gamma-ray burst
on December 29, 1999 at 15:10:26 UT.  Triangulation of this
event yields two alternate, ~700 sq. arcmin. error boxes whose
corners are at:

      RA(2000)          DEC(2000)               
22 h 26 m  7.91 s      28 o 43 '  45.47 "     
22 h 24 m 41.17 s      29 o 10 '  38.02 "     
22 h 25 m 45.15 s      29 o 28 '   9.61 "     
22 h 24 m  5.15 s      30 o  4 '  45.86 " 

                 AND    

22 h 17 m 11.91 s     35 o 22 '  46.66 "
22 h 17 m  2.57 s     34 o 49 '  56.05 "
22 h 18 m 45.26 s     34 o 42 '  23.34 "
22 h 18 m 49.07 s     33 o 59 '  50.67 "

Although these error boxes can be refined, it will probably
not be possible to resolve the ambiguity between them with
the present observations.
