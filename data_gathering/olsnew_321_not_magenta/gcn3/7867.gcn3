B. Sbarufatti, V. Mangano, V. La Parola (INAF-IASF Pa) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Swift-XRT continued observing the afterglow of the INTEGRAL-detected
GRB 080603A. After the first  detection of the X-ray afterglow, showing
flare like activity previously reported (Sbarufatti et al., GCN Circ.
7810) Swift detected the source also at T+234 ks, with count-rate
(8+/-2)E-3 counts/s (2.6 ks exposure) and at T+578 ks, with count-rate
(2.5+/-0.8)E-3 counts/s (6.9 ks exposure). Extrapolation from these two
points gives a power-law decay index of 1.3 +/- 0.4 (1-sigma CL) for
the afterglow.

This Circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
