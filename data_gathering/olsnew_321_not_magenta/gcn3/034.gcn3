Bruce Grossan, Robert Knop, Saul Perlmutter (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory and CfPA, U.C. Berkeley), and Isobel Hook(ESO) report that the
optical transient counterpart to GRB980326 was observed with 900 seconds of
exposure at Keck II with the LRIS instrument on UT 1998 March 30.2.  Relative
photometric measurements were made with respect to the second and third stars
given in IAUC6582, and the average of these two relative measurements yielded
approximately R=24.5 mag.  A 1.5" aperture was used in 0.9" seeing conditions
for these preliminary results.
