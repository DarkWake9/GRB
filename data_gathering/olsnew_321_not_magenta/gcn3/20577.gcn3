Mini-MegaTORTORA nine-channel wide-field monitoring system  with high
temporal resolution responded to the BAT trigger and observed the position
of GRB 170702A (Racusin et al. GCN 20575) since 2017-02-02 18:28:50 UT
(T+47.8 s) and until 2017-02-02 18:39:04 UT (T + 662.0 s). The system
acquired a series of 5 s exposure frames with all 9 channels pointed to the
object location in white light, with and without polarimetric filters
installed. No transient object is detected over this interval, with
detection limit on a single frame V=13.0 mag. Co-adding 9 simultaneous
frames improves the detection limit to V=14.0 mag at the mid-time of first
exposure (Tmid = T+50.3 s, 5 s exposure).

Mini-MegaTORTORA belongs to Kazan Federal University and is located at
Special Astrophysical Observatory near Russian 6-m telescope.
