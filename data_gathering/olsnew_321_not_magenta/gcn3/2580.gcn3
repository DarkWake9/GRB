NUMBER:  2580
SUBJECT: GRB040422: optical observations at CrAO

FROM:    Vasilij Rumjantsev at CrAO  <rum@crao.crimea.ua>

V.Rumyantsev (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 040422 (INTEGRAL trigger 1758,
GCN2572, Mereghetti et. al) with 2.6 m Shajn telescope (F/3.9) at Crimean
Astrophysical Observatory. The observation start (UT) Apr. 22, 23:37  under
poor sky conditions (seeing ~2.5 arcsec).

Several R-images taken between (UT) Apr. 22, 23:37 - Apr. 23, 01:39 with
exposition 120 s of each frame covered 60% of the GRB error box. Comparison
with DSS2 reveals no new objects brighter than limits of DSS2. The limiting
magnitude of co-added images is ~21R.
