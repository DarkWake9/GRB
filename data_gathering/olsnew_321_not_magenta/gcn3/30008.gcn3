E. Ambrosi (INAF-IASFPA), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), N. J. Klingler (PSU),
F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) has triggered on a new event and Swift has
slewed to the location of this trigger. The trigger time is believed to be no
earlier than 17:08 UT. Given the loss of real-time antennae for half the sky, we
are unable to confirm the nature, location, or exact time of this trigger until
the full data have been downloaded, in approximately 3 hours (by around 22:00 UT). 

Limited XRT and UVOT data have been received. No counterpart is detected; however,
given the location of the image centre, we infer that the BAT position must have
been around RA,Dec = 2.9670, -21.8750 degrees (J2000.0), with an uncertainty of 12â€™. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Ambrosi (elena.ambrosi AT inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
