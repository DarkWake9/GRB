Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160325A (trigger #680436)
(Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 19222).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 15.697, -72.702 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  01h 02m 47.4s
  Dec(J2000) = -72d 42' 06.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts at
~ T-60 s and ends at ~T+60 s. The burst location came into the BAT FoV
at ~T-93 s during a preplanned slew, so there could be further burst activities
beforehand. The burst structure contains two main pulses. The first pulse starts
at ~T-60 s, peaks at ~ T-34 s, and ends at ~T-25 s. The second pulse starts
at ~T0, peaks at ~T+3 s, and ends ~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.9 +- 14.7 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-51.74 to T+60.45 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.27 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-33.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
