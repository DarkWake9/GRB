We observed the field of GRB 210820A (Beardmore, et al., GCN 30664) with
the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2021/08 21.27 to 2021/08 21.50 UTC (12.47 to 17.96
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.70 hours exposure
in the r and i bands.

We detect one source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Beardmore, et al.,
GCN 30667).  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain:

  r = 22.84 +/- 0.22
  i = 22.66 +/- 0.18

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source is located at RA, Dec = 1:22:33.47, +4:36:28.1 (J2000, +/-0.5").
This is 0.2 arcsec away from the UVOT OT (GCN 30664).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
