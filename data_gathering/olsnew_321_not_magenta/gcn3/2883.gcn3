on behalf of the Swift BAT team.

At 15:38:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB041219b.  The spacecraft did not autonomously slew
to the burst since automated slewing is not yet enabled.  Automated
notification through TDRSS is also disabled during this early commissioning
phase of the mission.

The ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 167.674,-33.458 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 12 arcmin (radius, including a large systematic
uncertainty due to the lack of an on-orbit bore-sight alignment calibration).
This is ~25 degrees off the BAT bore sight and is ~90% encoded.  It was 
a 82 sigma detection.

The burst lightcurve has one strong peak (width ~5 sec) of 10 events/cm^2/sec
in the ~15 to 200 keV band.  It is preceded by one small peak and followed
by two small peaks.  The total duration was 30 sec.
