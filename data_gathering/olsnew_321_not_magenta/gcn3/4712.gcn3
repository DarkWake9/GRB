J. Kirshbrown, C. MacLeod, A. LaCluyze, J. Haislip, M. Nysewander, D.
Reichart, J. A. Crain, A. Foster, and K. Ivarsen report on behalf of the
UNC team of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We continued to observe the localization of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN
4682) with three of the PROMPT telescopes in Ui'I beginning 25.7 hours
after the burst under the automated control of Skynet.

We detect the afterglow (Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) at I = 18.79 +/- 0.16 mag
at an effective time of 26.3 hours after the burst (calibrated to five SDSS
stars; Cool et al., GCN 4695; using the transformation equations of Smith
et al. 2002.)

In the i' band, the afterglow continues to fade as a power law (Haislip et
al., GCN 4709), with a best-fit temporal index of -1.05 between 1.63 and
26.3 hours after the burst.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned at CTIO.
