GRB 140419A: ROTSE-III Detection of Optical Counterpart

T. Guver (Istanbul Univ.), F. V. Ferrante (SMU), H. Flewelling  
(IfA/Hawaii), R. Kehoe (SMU), G. Dhungana (SMU) report on behalf of  
the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB  
140419A (Swift trigger 596426, GCN 16118). The first image was at  
04:07:18.7 UT, 27.3 s after the burst (8.7 s after the GCN notice  
time). The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We  
detect a new object, not visible in the DSS (second epoch), with  
coordinates:

08:27:57.7 +46:14:25.9 (J2000), with positional uncertainty of 1' or better

----------------------------------
04:07:18.7 13.5 15.0

The object first detected with a magnitude of ~13.5, brightened to  
12.5 magnitudes in ~70 seconds then the brightness decayed fast to  
~14.3 magnitudes at about 350 seconds.

A jpeg image is available at

object marked 8 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
