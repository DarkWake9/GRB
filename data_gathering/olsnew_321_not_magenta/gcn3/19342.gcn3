The long-duration GRB 160424A
(Swift-BAT trigger #683906: Lien et al., GCN Circ. 19335;
Krimm et al., GCN Circ. 19338;
Fermi GBM detection: Hoi-Fung Yu, GCN Circ. 19340)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=42546.397 s UT (11:49:06.397).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a total
duration of ~2.3 s. The emission is seen up to 2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB160424_T42546/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.59(-0.35,+0.60)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.464 s,
of 1.71(-0.62,+0.84)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -1.24(-0.51,+0.66)
and Ep = 133(-40,+134) keV (chi2 = 58/60 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.0
(chi2 = 57/59 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
