K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, 

S.Golenetskii, E.Mazets, V.Pal'shin, and D.Frederiks on behalf
of Konus-Wind and Helicon/Coronas-F teams, and

T.Cline on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind teams, report:

Ulysses and RHESSI also observed this burst (GCN 2025). 

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA, Decl(2000)=
158.367,  41.226 degrees, whose radius is 89.886 +/-  0.065 degrees (3 sigma ).
This annulus intersects the Konus-Helicon annulus to form two
large error boxes, only one of which is in the correct ecliptic latitude
band.  The intersection points are:

RA(2000)	Dec(2000)
156.798		-48.714
156.710		-48.583
164.555		-48.558
164.440		-48.435


This error box can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
