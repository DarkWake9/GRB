  M. Im, I. Lee (Seoul National University), and Y. Urata
  (Saitama University) on behalf of the EAFON team:

   Using the Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) 1.0m telescope
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute,
  we observed GRB071020 (GCN 6949, Holland et al.),
  beginning at 09:01:45 UT on Oct 21. (1.0825 days after the burst).
   We confirm the afterglow (GCN6948 Schaefer, McKay, & Yuan; GCN6956,
  Xin et al.; GCN6953, Bloom et al.).
   Compared with the photometry in the report by Xin et al. (GCN6956),
  our data suggest that the afterglow is not fading signficiantly over
  the 12 hrs span and may even be brightenning by a small amount.
   Since the target is still bright enough for small telescopes,
  we encourage the further observations of this object.

   Photometry of the object is given below.
