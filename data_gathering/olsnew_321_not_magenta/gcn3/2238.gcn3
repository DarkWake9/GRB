>From an analysis of the HETE FREGATE data for GRB030519B (=H2716), we
find that the peak flux over 5 s is ~ 8 x 10^-7 erg cm-2 s-1 in the
7-30 keV energy band and ~ 7 x 10^-6 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 30-400 keV
energy band.  Similarly, we find that the fluence of the burst is 7 x
10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 7-30 keV energy band and ~ 6 x 10^-5 erg cm-2 in
the 30-400 keV energy band.  Thus this burst is bright and its fluence
is large (the latter is in the top 1% of those for all BATSE bursts).
In addition, a preliminary spectral analysis of the FREGATE data
indicates that the spectral slope of the burst at high (> 100 keV)
energies is > -2, and thus E_peak > 400 keV.

In GCN Circular 2235 (Lamb et al. 2003), the date of the burst was
reported as 3 May 2003 and the width of the WXM localization rectangle
was reported as 24 arcminutes.  These are incorrect; the date of the
burst is 19 May 2003 and the width of the localization rectangle is
17.4 arcminutes.  Neither affect the WXM or the HETE/IPN error boxes
reported in GCNs 2235 (Lamb et al. 2003) and 2237 (Hurley et al. 2003);
the size of the latter is ~35 square arcminutes.

Follow-up observations of this burst are strongly encouraged.
