SUBJECT: GRB001105, BVRI field photometry

FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope for
an 11x11 arcmin field that is centered on the IPN
error box (Hurley et al. GCN 874) for GRB001105.
The photometric data is based on a single photometric
night, but with poor seeing.  Additional photometry will
be acquired if an optical transient is found in this error box.

We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb001108.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors are less than 100mas.
