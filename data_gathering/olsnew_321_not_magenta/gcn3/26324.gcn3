SUBJECT: GRB 191004A: correction to reported GROND upper limits

P. Schady (Univ. of Bath) reports:

I would like to correct a mistake in the GROND g'r'i'z' upper limits reported in Schady et al. (GCN #25959). The reported afterglow position (Osborne et al., GCN #25950; Lipunov et al., GCN #25944) lay at the edge of the g'r'i'z' field of view, where the exposure coverage is not complete. Taking into account the exposure map reduces the optical band 3 sigma upper limits reported in GCN #25959 by around 0.5 mag. The correct 3 sigma upper limits (AB system) are as follows:

g’ > 23.3
r’ > 23.7
i’ > 23.1
z’ > 22.7

I would like to thank Jochen Greiner for bringing this mistake to my attention.
