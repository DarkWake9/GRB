TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB 060515: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

A. Breeveld (MSSL/UCL) and J. Cummings (GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began taking data on the field of GRB 060515, 3364s
(including the 10s V settling exposure) after the trigger (trigger
#210084). Swift did not slew immediately after the trigger because of an
earth constrait (Cummings et al., GCN Circular 5132). At the position of
the XRT error circle (Page and Kennea, GCN 5137) there are no new
sources to the following 3 sigma upper limits:

Filter  T_range(s)  Exp(s)  3sig_UL(mag)
V       3364-11674  1062.4  20.1
B       4309-5893   347.0   20.4
U       4104-5735   393.3   20.2
UVW1    3900-5531   393.3   20.4
UVM2    3695-5326   393.3   20.7
UVW2    4718-10989  1082.2  21.4
White (160-650nm)  3384-10084  1179.9  20.9

These upper limits are uncorrected for the estimated Galactic reddening
of E(B-V) = 0.03 mags.
