The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 12:10:11 UT on 23 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220323A (trigger 669730216.566582 / 220323507).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 355.2, Dec = 71.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 40m, 71d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25.0 degrees.
