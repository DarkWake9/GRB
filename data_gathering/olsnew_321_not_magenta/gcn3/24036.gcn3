report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-03-31T02:14:38.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 190331A(trigger ID: HEB190331093) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Swift/BAT(K. L. Page et al. ,GCN 24027)
and Fermi/GBM (M. Niwano et al. ,GCN 24032).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of one 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 7.65 s measured from T0+0.13 s.
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.271 s, is 1552 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 1691 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
