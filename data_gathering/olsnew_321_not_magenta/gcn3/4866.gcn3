SUBJECT: GRB060218: SARA Observations of SN2006aj
DATE:    06/03/12 23:37:38 GMT
FROM:    Autumn Homewood at Clemson U  <ahomewo@clemson.edu>

A.L. Homewood, C.A. Riddle, K.V. Garimella, M.R. Troutman, D.H. Hartmann
(Clemson University) and G.D. Henson (ETSU) report on behalf of the
Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We have imaged the field of GRB060218 (GCN 4775, 4776) beginning
approximately 4 days after the trigger notice with the SARA 0.9-m at Kitt
Peak, under good weather conditions. We obtained 9 300-seconds exposures
in V filter and 7 300-second exposures in B filter. We detect the
supernova in each exposure and have carried out the following data
analysis:

Observations in V began at UT Feb. 22.0923958 and ended at 22.1539931. We
observe magnitudes ranging from V=17.3 to 17.7 +/- 0.2 mag during that
time period.

Similiarly, observations in B began at UT Feb. 22.096088 and ended at
22.1504167. We observed magnitudes ranging from B=18.2  to 18.7 +/-0.2
mag.

These values correspond to single 300-second exposures, and quoted errors
are 1-sigma. Further analyses of observations from additional nights are
in progress.
