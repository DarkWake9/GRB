on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 220130A
(GECAM detection: Zhao et al., GCN Circ. 31533;
Fermi-GBM detection: Lesage et al., GCN Circ. 31538)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 665277280), GECAM-B (GRD),
Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) at about 83676 s UT (23:14:36).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
-----------------------
RA(2000)    Dec(2000)
    deg          deg
-----------------------
Corners:
    5.551      -47.554
  358.843      -46.178
  343.052      -61.567
  348.140      -66.257
------------------------
The error box area is 94.5 deg2, and its maximum
dimension is 19 deg (the minimum one is 4.9 deg).
The Sun distance was about 58 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi (GBM) and GECAM localizations.

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
