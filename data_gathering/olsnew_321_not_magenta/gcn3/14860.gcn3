follow-up collaboration:

We observed of  the field of  the Swift GRB 130610A (Cummings et al., 
GCN 14842)  with 0.45-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory starting on 
June, 10 (UT) 03:53:49. Series of 30 s  exposures were obtained in clear 
filter. In the combined images we detect afterglow  (Cummings et al., 
GCN 14842; Melandri et al., GCN 14843; Trotter et al., GCN 14844). 
Preliminary photometry  is based  on the SDSS nearby  stars:
