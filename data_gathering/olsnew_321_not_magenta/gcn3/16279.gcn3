We have obtained spectroscopic observations of the afterglow of GRB 140415A
(D'Avanzo et al., GCN 16267; Chornock et al. GCN 16269; Fong et al. GCN
16274; de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 16278) using the 10.4m GTC telescope
(+OSIRIS). Our observation started at 22:37 UT (13.41 hr after the burst),
with a seeing of 0.6", and consisted of 3x1800s exposures using grism
R2500I, which covers the range between 7330 and 10000 A at a resolution of
~2500.


In a preliminary reduction we detect a strong continuum above 8900 A, with
no significant absorption features. The sharp decay below 8900 A is
consistent with Ly-alpha absorption at the redshift of 6.32 suggested by
Chornock et al. (GCN 16269). The transmission of the Ly-forest is low, but
some emission is detected down to the blue limit of our spectrum.
