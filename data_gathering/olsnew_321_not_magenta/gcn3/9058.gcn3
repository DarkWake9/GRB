"Following the detection by Fermi LAT and GBM of GRB 090328 (McEnery
et al. GCNC 9044), follow-up observations were performed by the 0.6-m
Yock-Allen robotic telescope at the new BOOTES-3 astronomical station in
Blenheim (New Zealand). A co-added 1500s unfiltered image, obtained on
29 Mar (10:12-10:41 UT, i.e. 24.8 hr after the onset of the event) shows 
a rather bright optical afterglow at the UVOT position reported by Kennea et al. 
(GCNC 9046). We measure R~19.7+/-0.3 (clear filter), calibrated against USNO-B1.0
stars.  Additional observations are encouraged."

(which were local time) were converted to true UT time values; the "36.8 hrs"
was changed to "24.8"; and Cervino was added to the author list.]
