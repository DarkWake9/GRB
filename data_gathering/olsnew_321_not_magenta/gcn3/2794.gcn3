FROM:    Shashi Bhushan Pandey at State Obs.Nainital,India  <shashi@upso.ernet.in>

Kuntal Misra and S. B. Pandey (ARIES NainiTal), on behalf of 
larger Indian GRB collaboration

We observed several R_c band frames of the GRB 041006 optical afterglow, 
determined the magnitudes in comparison with the stars A and B as reported 
in GCN 2792 using 1.04-m telescope of ARIES Nainital India. The OT decayed 
by ~ 0.5 mag from Oct 6.75 to Oct 6.91 UT.

Preliminary R_c - band magnitudes are:

Oct 6.776284   19.81  0.05
Oct 6.830509   20.00  0.05
Oct 6.862395   20.02  0.05
Oct 6.877175   20.18  0.06

The temporal flux decay index is ~ -1.0. We did not notice any considerable 
steepening in the light curve using our data set.
