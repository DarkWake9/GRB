We obtained  a lot of images of the central part of the large HETE
Field-of-View during standart MASTER (http://observ.pereplet.ru)
sky survey last night (about 100 square degrees before and after
GRB time (HETE alert 3693)).
You can see the history of observations at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB050316/HETE050316.gif  .
We have 6 images per each 6 square degrees up to 19.5 magnitude on summ
and  low resolution spectra (50 A) on each central part (40'x30') of the
image.
One image was received through GRB-time: 21:10:29.385 - 21:11:14.385 UT.
There is no OT up to 16.5 with its life-time less than 45 s at this image.

After  HETE alert 3693   MASTER robotic telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru)
had  imaging  the corresponding (HETE alert 3693, 05/03/16, 21:11:17.67
UT, S/C_Update, WXM ) error box (GCN Circ 3106).  We have about 50
unfiltered images of the error box (30s
exposition, 6 square  degrees field) started at 16 Mar 2005	21:13:01
UT (103 s after   GRB time).
The limiting magnitude on the images was about 18.0.
The JPG-images  of the error box  are available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB050316/2.jpg .
No new optical sources with respect to USNO B.

The triangulation with other Gamma-detectors would be very
helpfull because HETE error box rejected.
