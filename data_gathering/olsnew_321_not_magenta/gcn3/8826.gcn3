F. Olivares (MPE Garching), A. Rossi (Tautenburg Obs.), A. Kupcu Yoldas (ESO), J. Greiner, and A. Yoldas (both MPE Garching) report on behalf
of the GROND team:

We observed the field of the possible GRB 090118 (Swift BATSS trigger, Copete et al. GCN
#8825) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405)
mounted at the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla (Chile).
Observations started at 00:55 UT, about 11 hrs after the GRB.

Comparison to the Digital Sky Survey reveals no new sources within the Swift/BAT error circle
(Copete et al. GCN #8825). Co-added images of the first 8 minutes yield the following 5-sigma limits (in AB magnitudes):

r' > 23.2
i' > 22.5

The magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS.
