O.J. Roberts (USRA/NASA) and C. Meegan (UAH) report on 
behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:11:16.40 UT on the 8th of February 2017, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 170208A
(trigger 508270281 / 170208758), which was also detected by 
Swift (A. Cholden-Brown et al. 2017, GCN 20631). The GBM 
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time using the Swift-XRT position is 117 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of a long GRB with several
episodes of bright emission over a duration (T90) of about
7 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s
to T0+7.2 s is best fit by a power law function with an 
exponential high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is 
-0.92 +/- 0.09 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak 
is 246.9 +/- 30.5 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(3.10 +/- 0.19)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.13 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.1 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
