The long GRB 070419B (Swift/BAT trigger #276212 ; Parsons et al.,
GCN 6305; Palmer et al., GCN 6327), was detected at 10:44:01 UT (=T0)
by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy
range of 50 keV - 5 MeV. The observed light curve shows two separate
peak structures with a duration (T90) of about 71 seconds. The fluence
in 100-1000 keV was (1.1 +/-0.2) X 10^-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux was
0.9 +/-0.1 photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that time-averaged spectrum from T0-5 to
T0+83 sec is well fitted by a single power law with a photon index
of 1.7 +/-0.2.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
