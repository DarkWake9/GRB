Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191101A (trigger #932742)
(D'Ai, et al., GCN Circ. 26135).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 251.845, 43.740 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  16h 47m 22.8s 
  Dec(J2000) = +43d 44' 24.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 47%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, rather weak pulse, extending from
~T-20 sec, peaking at T+0 sec, dropping sharply at T+25 sec, followed by low-level
extended emission out to ~T+140 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 137.95 +- 22.83 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-20.97 to T+143.53 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.78 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-1.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
