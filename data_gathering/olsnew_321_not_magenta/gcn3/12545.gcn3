V. Pelassa (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:50:25.48 UT on 07 November 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered and located GRB 111107A (trigger 342319827 /
111107035) which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Siegel et al.
2011, GCN 12534). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the
Swift position. The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 119 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a FRED-like pulse with a duration
(T90) of about 12 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-1.024 s to T0+11.264 s is well fit by a power law function with an
exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.38 +/- 0.21
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 108 +/- 32 keV
(Castor statistics 318.55 for 365 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.392 +/- 0.197)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.96 s in the 10-1000 keV band is
2.6 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
