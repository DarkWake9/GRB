Alexis Coleiro (APC/Universite de Paris) and Damien Dornic (CPPM/CNRS) on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration. 

Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported AMON IC-HAWC coincidence NuEm-211209A alert (GCN #31192 <https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/31192.gcn3>). 

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were detected within 3 degrees from the coincidence coordinates over a time period [12/09/2021 00h50 - 04h39 UTC] corresponding to 75% of the HAWC transit time mentioned in the AMON notice, and during which the potential source remained visible in the up-going field of view of ANTARES. 

This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino radiant fluence from a point source of about 15 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 3 TeV â€“ 3.3 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and about 26 GeV.cm^-2 (0.5 - 290 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. These indicative limits have been computed for the end of the HAWC transit time. 

A search over an extended time window of +/-1 day has also yielded no detection (53% visibility). 

ANTARES <http://antares.in2p3.fr/> is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
