The Fermi GBM Team reports:

"
Due to a data processing error, the names of two GRBs localized by Fermi
GBM were incorrectly reported in GCN 30630 and GCN 30632.

The error was corrected and the final real-time localizations of these GRBs
were re-sent in two new GCNs. The correction for GCN 30630 was sent as GCN
30635 with the name GRB 210812B. The correction for GCN 30632 was sent as
GCN 30633 with the name GRB 210812A.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused."
