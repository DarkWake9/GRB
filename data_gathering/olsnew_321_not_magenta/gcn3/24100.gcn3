and INFN Trieste), report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190412m at T0 = 2019-04-12 05:30:44.17 (UT),
a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that
the S190412m 90% c.l. localization region was occulted by the Earth.

However, exposure of the field was obtained before and after T0. Additional
analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
