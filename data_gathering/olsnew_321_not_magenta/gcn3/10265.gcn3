Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 091208B (trigger 
#378559) (Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 10256).  The BAT ground-
calculated position is RA, Dec = 29.411, 16.881 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  01h 57m 38.5s
    Dec(J2000) = +16d 52' 50.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 10%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows two separated FRED peaks. The first
at T0 was weaker and softer than the second at T+8 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 14.9 +- 3.7 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+22.3 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.74 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band was
3.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+8.1 sec in the 15-150 keV band was 15.2 +- 1.0 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
