Report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,
(=H2656, Vanderspek et al. GCN 1997), identified
by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986),
in the Johnson B-Band with the SARA 0.9m telescope at 
KPNO. We obtained 30, 300s exposures.  Observations
began at 03:06:49UT, and ended at 05:39:50UT, on April

seeing conditions.  Aperture photometry is being 
carried out, and further observations are planned.
