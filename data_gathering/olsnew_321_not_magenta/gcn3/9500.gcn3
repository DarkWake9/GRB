The first short burst from the newly discovered SGR 0418+5729
(van der Horst et al., GCN 9499) triggered Konus-RF gamma-ray 
spectrometer on-board the CORONAS-PHOTON solar space observatory
at 2009-06-05 T0(KRF)=74449.134 s UT (20:40:49.134).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of
~0.02 s. There is a hint of a weak soft emission with a duration of 
~0.03 s after the pulse.

As observed by Konus-RF the burst
had a fluence of (8.3 +/- 1.3)x10^-8 erg/cm2,
and a 2-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.238 s
of (1.53 +/- 0.43)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 10 - 200 keV energy range).

Preliminary analysis of the time-integrated spectrum shows that it is 
well fitted (in the 10 - 200 keV range) by OTTB model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-1)*exp(-E/E0)
with E0 = 35(-7, +8) keV (chi2 = 1.1/5 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
