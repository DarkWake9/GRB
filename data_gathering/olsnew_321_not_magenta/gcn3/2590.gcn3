report:

Optical observation of the field of GRB 040511 (HETE trigger #3218,
GCN 2588) was carried out using a 1k x 1k CCD Camera covering a field of 
6'x 6', mounted on the 104-cm Sampurnanand telescope located at Aryabhatta
Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Manora Peak, Nainital. We
took frames at 20:17 UT on 11 May, 2004 (7.16 hours after the burst) at
large (about 5.4) airmass. We obtained three 300s R band images.

Visual comparison of the combined images with the USNO-A2.0
catalog does not reveal any new source down to a limiting magnitude 
of R ~ 19.5 inside the 2.67 arcmin error circle around the position 
reported by HETE SXC (GCN 2588). Images can be obtained from the authors
(e-mail: brij@upso.ernet.in).
