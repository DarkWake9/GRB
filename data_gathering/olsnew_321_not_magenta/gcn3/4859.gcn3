At 01:36:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered
and located GRB 060312 (trigger=201391).  Swift slewed immediately
to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 45.768, +12.820 {03h 03m 04s, +12d 49' 12"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was 1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger.

The XRT began observing the burst position at 01:37:03 UT (51 s after
the BAT trigger).  The XRT found a bright, uncataloged, fading source
located at
RA(J2000) = 3h 03m 06.1s
Dec(J2000) = +12d 50' 04"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (90% confidence radius).
This is 58 arcseconds from the BAT position.  The initial flux
was 1.8E-9 ergs/cm2/s.

The UVOT is currently in a state where it is unable to take data.
