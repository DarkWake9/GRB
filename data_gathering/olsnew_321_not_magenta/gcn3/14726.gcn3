Using the data set from T-239 to T+464 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130529A (trigger #556930)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 14717).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 24.274, -64.143 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 37m 05.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 08' 34.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows the burst starting at ~T-20 sec,
peaking at about T+80 sec, and ending at ~T+260 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 128 +- 35 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.02 to T+150.62 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.56 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+64.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
