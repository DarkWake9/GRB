report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-02-15T18:31:22.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 190215A(trigger ID: HEB190215771) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (B. Mailyan et al., GCN 23898).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of two 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 14.80 s measured from T0+1.22 s.
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+6.155 s, is 3193.6 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 28093.7 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
