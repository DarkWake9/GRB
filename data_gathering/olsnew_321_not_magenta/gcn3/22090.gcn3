We observed the field of GRB 171102B (Ukwatta et al., GCN 22082) using 
the 0.36m and 0.60m telescopes located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. All 
imaged were taken without filter.

Our photometry was summarized as follows:
========================================
Tmid(s)+T0  Telescope  Exptime(s)       UL(R)

389               36cm        40*3             >16.10

645               60cm        30*3             >17.80

1365             60cm        60*15           >18.55

========================================
Note: (1) Photometry is calibrated with stars (R2 magnitude) in the USNO 
B1 catalogue, although images were taken without filter.
