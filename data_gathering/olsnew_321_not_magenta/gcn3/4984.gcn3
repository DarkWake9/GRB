GRB 060418 : IR afterglow observations

" We have performed IR follow-up observations for GRB 060418 (Falcone
et al. GCN 4966) with CFHT/WIRCam at 8 hours after the GRB. The
afterglow was detected in JHKs bands clearly.  The afterglow
brightness estimated from 2MASS catalog is Ks = 16.8 +/-0.1 at 8.11
hours after the burst. During our observational period, the decay
index is about 1 in Ks band. "
