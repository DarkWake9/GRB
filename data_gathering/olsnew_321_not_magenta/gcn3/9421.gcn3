V. Chaplin (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:35:35.34 UT on 13 May 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located the weak GRB 090513B (trigger 263946937 / 090513941).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 99.1, DEC = -72.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 6 h 36 m, -72 d 54 '), with an uncertainty
of 8.8 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 119 degrees.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
