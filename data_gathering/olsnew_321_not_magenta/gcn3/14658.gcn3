Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130515A (trigger #555880)
(Malesani, et al., GCN Circ. 14650).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 283.436, -54.283 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 53m 44.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 16' 57.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 69%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks starting
at ~T+0.00, peaking at ~T+0.00 and ~T+0.30, and ending at ~T+0.40 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.29 +- 0.06 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.04 to T+0.33 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.77 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.35 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
