"At 05:09:32.233 UT on 5 November 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201105B (trigger 626245777 / 201105215).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data,
is RA = 244.5, DEC = 16.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent
to 16h 18m, -16d 02'), with an uncertainty of 1.0 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally a 
systematic error which we have characterized as a mixture of two Gaussians,
one with a radius of 1.8 degrees (52% contribution) and one with a radius 
of 4.1 degrees (47% contribution) [A. Goldstein et al. 2020, ApJ, 895, 1] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 92 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a FRED emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 17 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+23 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 512 +/- 21 keV,
alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.35 +/- 0.09.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.13 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.7 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 28.5 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
