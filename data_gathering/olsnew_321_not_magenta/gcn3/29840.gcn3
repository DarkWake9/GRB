WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 210419C (Moss et al.,

GCN 29834) starting at 6.87 hours after the burst. A total of

30x60s images were obtained in the clear (roughly R) filters.

We do not detect any new source within the enhanced XRT error circle

(Beardmore et al., GCN 29839) in the co-add images, down to a limiting

magnitude of ~21.5 mag calibrated to the PS1 catalog.
