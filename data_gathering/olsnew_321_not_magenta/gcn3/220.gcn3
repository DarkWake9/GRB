TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  220
SUBJECT: GRB990123 Optical Observations

A. Maury (Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur), M. Boer, S. Chaty (Centre
d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements), report:
We observed GRB 990123 from the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur 0.9m
Schmidt Telescope. The optical counterpart of the GRB is clearly
detected as well as the host galaxy. Below are the unfiltered
magnitudes, corresponding approximately to R magnitudes, given the
detector response. The mean uncertainty is 0.4 mag. The resulting decay
slope, is 1.35, which is in good agreement with the slope mentionned by
Bloom et al. (GCN Report #208), given the uncertainties.
