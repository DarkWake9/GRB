Edo Berger, Gus Oemler, and Mike Gladders (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"On 2005, April 6.99 UT we imaged the position of GRB 050406 (GCN 3180)
with LDSS-3 on the Magellan/Clay telescope in the r-band and i-band.  
Within the 5" radius XRT error circle (GCN 3184) we find a single faint
source (r~22 mag) close to the detection threshold of both images.  The
position of this object is (J2000):
        RA =  02:17:52.3
        DEC= -50:11:15
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  At the present we
cannot confirm whether the object has faded."
