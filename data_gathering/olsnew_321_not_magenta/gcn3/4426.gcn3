The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=175653) at ~04:03 UT on 03 January 2006
is probably not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source.
The background is high while entering the SAA.  This was a single-sided
trigger criterion which is susceptible to rising backgrounds.

The XRT began observing the field in the SAA and attempted to find a 
centroid of a bright source in the field of view, but failed to find a 
source.  This is consistent with a non-burst origin for this event, but 
this is not conclusive, as we only succeed in on-board centroids 
approximately 40% of the time due to faint afterglows.

This GCN Notices have the same incorrect trigger time as did
the previous burst.  This problem is being worked.
