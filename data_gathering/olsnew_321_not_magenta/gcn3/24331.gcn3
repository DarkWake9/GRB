(GROWTH) collaborations:

We continued observations of the gravitational wave trigger S190426c 
(LVC et al. GCN 24237) with ZTF on UT 2019-04-28. We covered 1150 sq deg 
in g-band and r-band with over 54% of the enclosed probability targeted 
based on the latest sky map (LALInference1.fits.gz, GCN 24277). Each 
exposure on the second night was 300s, with a typical depth of 22 mag. 
In total, over both nights, we have covered 4420 sq deg, enclosing 56% 
of the the total probability. See details in Coughlin et al. (GCN 24283) 
for additional details on data processing.

Additional candidates with no detections prior to merger, inside the 90% 
localization area of the LALInference sky map, and not consistent with 
the locations of known AGN or other variable objects, are:

Notes:
[rising] : Rising light curve
[lowb] : Galactic latitude less than 15 degrees
[agn?] : WISE colors consistent within an AGN within 1" of the transient.
[hostless] : No discernable host galaxy or other counterpart.
[nuc] : Close to the host nucleus.
[fading] : Clear fading is observed over the past two nights, with no 
prior rise.  This may indicate a CV / dwarf nova.

Three candidates (ZTF19aassfws, ZTF19aasmddt, ZTF19aaslszp) are 
interesting given that their photometric redshifts are consistent with 
the LVC error volume.  ZTF19aaslzjf is also in a galaxy that is likely 
nearby, although no redshift estimate is available.  ZTF19aasmftm is 
interesting given a (probable) rising light curve that suggests a young 
object, although its galaxy counterpart is very faint (r=21.2 in PS1). 
Deep upper limits preceding the detections are not available for any of 
these sources, and they could be unrelated SNe.

Additional follow-up and analysis is ongoing.
