D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Fugazza (INAF/Brera), S. Covino (INAF/Brera), 
L. Angelo Antonelli (INAF/Roma), A. Harutyunyan (INAF/TNG), G. Tessicini 
(INAF/TNG), G. Andreuzzi (INAF/TNG), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 110106A (Mangano et al., GCN 11520) in the 
K band with the 3.6m TNG equipped with NICS. A total of 60 min 
integrations were obtained with a mean time Jan 7.07 UT (10.33 hr after 
the GRB).

We detect no sources within the refined X-ray position (Osborne et al., 
GCN 11526; see also http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions), down to a 
3-sigma limiting magnitude K > 20.3. We clearly detect the z=0.093 
galaxy just outside the error circle (Malesani et al., GCN 11524; 
Piranomonte et al., GCN 11530), with a magnitude K=14.90 +- 0.06 
(calibration against 2MASS stars in the field).
