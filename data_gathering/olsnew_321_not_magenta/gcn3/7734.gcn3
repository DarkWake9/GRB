D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), P.E. Nissen (Univ. Aarhus), W.J. Schuster 
(UNAM), and J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 080514B (Rapisarda et al., GCN 7715; 
Giuliani et al., GCN 7716; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 7719) with the 
NOT equipped with ALFOSC. Observations were carried out with the B, R 
and I filters.

We clearly detect the afterglow in all bands. On mean time May 16.184 UT 
(1.77 days after the trigger), we measure R = 22.52 +- 0.10 (AB), 
calibrated against SDSS r magnitudes. The detection in B implies a 
redshift limit z < 3.7.
