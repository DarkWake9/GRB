The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the S191222n (2019-12-22 03:35:37, GCN26543) the spacecraft
was preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2173 and 2174 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2019-12-21T18:45:19 and
2019-12-22T10:44:07.
