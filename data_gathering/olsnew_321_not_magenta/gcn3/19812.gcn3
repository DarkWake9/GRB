The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160801A (D'Elia et al., GCN 19744) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Aug 02.75, Aug 04.75, and 
Aug 08.73 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Goad 
et al., GCN 19746), with 3sigma upper limits of 147 uJy, 123 uJy, and 
126 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
