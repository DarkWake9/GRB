K.Y. Huang (NTNU), Y. Urata (NCU) on behalf of EAFON report:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB131231A (Xu et al., GCN 15641)
using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) with g, r, i, and z
filters. The monitoring observation was made on the night of 1, 2 and
4, Jan, 2014. Based on nearby stars reported by Halpern (GCN15646) and
Perley (GCN15650), we made photometry of the GRB afterglow. The
temporal decay index alpha remains ~1 including the latest epoch. Some
of photometry is summarized below.

epoch(d) g-mag g-err
1.259    19.6  0.1
2.247    20.3  0.1
4.377    20.9  0.1
