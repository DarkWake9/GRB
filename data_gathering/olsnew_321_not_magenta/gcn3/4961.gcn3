 Using the data set from T-239 to T+510 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
 we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060413 (trigger #205096)
 (Pagani, et al., GCN 4957).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec =
 291.288,+13.746 deg {19h 25m 9.2s,+13d 44' 45.5"} (J2000) +- 1.9 arcmin,
 (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 100%.
  
 The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a slow rise starting at ~T+20
 to a cusp-like double peak, then followed by a slow decay
 ending at ~T+220 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 150 +- 10 sec
 (estimated error including systematics).
  
 The time-averaged spectrum from T+29.6 to T+257.1 is best fit by 
 a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
 spectrum is 1.67 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
 3.6 +- 0.1 x 10-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
 from T+90.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
 All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
