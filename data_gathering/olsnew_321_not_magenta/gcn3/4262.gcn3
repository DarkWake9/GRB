GRB 051111A : R-band temporal decay index based on Lulin observations

F.Y. Huang, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 051111 (GCN # 4247,
4248) using the Lulin 1m telescope with BVRI band filters between
10:07 UT and 14:54 UT on Nov 11 2005. Combine with our previous
preliminary result (GCN # 4258), the R-band light curve shows shallow
decay. When we fit all our R-band data with single power-law the
temporal index is determined as alpha~-0.6.

Further analysis is in progress."
