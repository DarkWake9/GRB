P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed optically bright burst GRB 071112C (GCN 7059) using the VLA
at a frequency of 8.46 GHz. The observations were taken at 08.01 UT on
2007,
November 16th. We do not detect any radio emission at the Swift-UVOT
afterglow position (GCN 7059). The flux density limit at the afterglow
position is    -19 +/- 38 uJy.
