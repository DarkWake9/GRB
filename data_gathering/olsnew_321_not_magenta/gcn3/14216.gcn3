Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

T11 (iTelescope Observatory, Mayhill, New Mexico) TEL T11 0.50-m/6.8
astrograph (0.50 m) f/6.5 and FLI ProLine PL11002M CCD camera were
used to detect GRB 130215A optical afterglow. The observations were
started at 2013-02-15 02:20:23 (UT) and stopped at 2013-02-15 03:22:20
(UT). Three unfiltered, two photometric R filter and two photometric V
filter observations with different exposure times were made.
The afterglow was detected at following position RA 02:54:00.73 and
DEC +13:23:43.4.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using
NOMAD1 1034-0036172 (R = 14.220, V = 15.030) as the comparison:
