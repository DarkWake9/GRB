N. Butler (UC Berkeley) reports:

We detect 12 X-ray sources with signal-to-noise ratio >3 with wavdetect 
in the 25.3 ksec exposure XRT image of the short GRB 060108 field (Racusin 
et al. 2006; GCN 5378).  Six position matches with optical sources in SDSS 
DR5 (see, sdss.org) give the following sizable frame shift:

        dRA   -4.29", dDec   -0.70"; +/-0.73" (90% conf.)

and the refined position:

        RA, Dec: 14 12 01.30  +16 58 54.4; +/- 1.1" (J2000, 90% conf.)

Our refined position is marginally consistent with the refined position
of the XRT team (Racusin et al. 2006; GCN 5382).  The position is fully
consistent with that of optical source B and marginally consistent with
that of optical source D (Castro-Tirado et al. 2006; GCN 5384; Piranomonte 
et al. 2006; GCN 5386).  It is inconsistent with the source A and C positions.
