report:

"Following the detection by SWIFT/BAT of GRB 050416B
(Hullinger et al., GCN 3279), the 0.6m BOOTES-IR
telescope at IAA's Observatorio de Sierra Nevada
responded automatically at 23:13 UT (i.e. 38 minutes
after the event). Although we are still testing the                    
telescope during the commissioning phase, and the                    
near-IR camera is not yet installed, an optical camera                    
was available. A co-addition of first 20 R-band images                    
taken at that particular instrument reveals no optical                    
counterpart in the SWIFT/BAT error box down to R = 19.                    
The instrument sensitivity was highly compromised due                    
to the presence of the nearby moon. Additional info on                    
BOOTES-IR can be found at www.iaa.csic.es/BOOTES-IR.html."
