S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU), D. M. Palmer (LANL),
M. C. Stroh (PSU) and C. A. Swenson (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 23:06:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on probably
noise in the image domain near the on-board catalog source NGC0746
(trigger=600914).  Swift did not slew because of the Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is  RA, Dec 29.393, +44.977, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 01h 57m 34s
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 58' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT real-time light curve does not show anything
significant as is typical for image trigger.  We will know more when
the full data set is downlinked and analyzed.
