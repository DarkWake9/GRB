D. A. Frail (NRAO) and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"Beginning on September 28.16 we observed the IPN error box of
GRB000926 (GCN #801) with the VLA at 8.46 GHz and 4.86 GHz.  A
quick-look analysis of the 8.46 GHz data reveals a ~0.5 mJy radio
source positionally coincident with the optical candidate reported by
Gorosabel et al. (GCN #803) and Dall et al. (GCN #804). Further
observations are planned."
