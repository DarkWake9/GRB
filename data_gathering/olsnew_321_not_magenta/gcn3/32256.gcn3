The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:58:35 UT on 24 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220624A (trigger 677732320.15865 / 220624124).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 179.0, Dec = 20.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 56m, 20d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
