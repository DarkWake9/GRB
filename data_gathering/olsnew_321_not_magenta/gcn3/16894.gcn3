N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and V. D'Elia (ASDC) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 141005A
94 s after the BAT trigger (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 16882).
This GRB was observed also by Fermi GBM (Roberts, GCN Circ. 16889), and
in the r and i bands (P60: Perley et al., GCN Circ. 16884, RATIR:
Littlejohn et al.,GCN Circ. 16885). A nearby galaxy was reported by
Perley et al., and is also seen in the UVOT images.
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position (Beardmore et
al. GCN Circ. 16888), or the P60 position is detected in the initial
UVOT exposures, although the event data for the UVOT b-band show a
slight brightening peaking around T+700s..
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.17 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
