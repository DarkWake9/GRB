A. Kuepcue Yoldas, A. Yoldas, J. Greiner, T. Kruehler (all MPE Garching),
A. Rossi (Tautenburg Obs) report for the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080212 (trigger 303105) detected by Swift/BAT 
(Ziaeepour et al. 2008, GCN 7296) simultaneously in grizJHK with GROND 
(Greiner et al. 2008, astro-ph/0801.4801), mounted at the 2.2m MPI/ESO 
telescope at La Silla (Chile). Observations started on Feb. 13, at 05:30 UT 
(12 hrs after the GRB), when the GRB location was becoming visible at 
20 degrees above horizon.

We detect a new source in all filters, suggesting the Ly-break being below the 
g'-band (and thus z<3.5). It is clearly separated from the galaxy mentioned by 
Berger et al. (2008, GCN 7294). The position is

  RA (2000.0) = 15:24:35.4 
  Decl (2000.0) = -22:44:30

At 6:36 UT we measure i'=22.6 mag. No statement about variability can be 
made at this stage. GROND observations are continuing.
