D. Xu (DARK/NBI), H.-B. Niu, J.-Z. Liu, G.-J. Feng, C.-H. Bai, A.
Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

Continued observations of GRB 131128A, 120s each for the beginning and
240s each for the subsequent all in R-band, at the Nanshan observatory
show that the afterglow candidate in Xu et al (GCN 15535) has decayed
by more than 1 magnitude at 1.95 hr after the Swift trigger,
calibrated with the same nearby SDSS stars. The initial magnitude is
R~19 mag in GCN 15535. We thus conclude that this object is the
optical afterglow of GRB 131128A.
