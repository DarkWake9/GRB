Astronomy and  Geophysics MAS),  I.Molotov (KIAM),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) 
report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

After receiving a full data set we report details of the  observation of 
the   field of GRB 140709B (Swenson et al., GCN 16551) with ORI-40 
telescope of Khureltogot observatory.  We started observation on July 09 
(UT) 15:31:51 and obtained 60 unfiltered images of 60 s exposure. 
Within enhanced XRT error circle  (Goad et al., GCN 16556) we do not 
detect any new object neither in separate, nor in stacked images. 
Details of a photometry is following

UT start   t-T0,d   Exp,s  Filter Up_lim (3 sigma)

15:31:51  0.01334   5*60   None   18.9
15:31:51  0.01940  20*60   None   19.5

The photometry is based on SDSS star J094401.61+633253.8 assuming 
R=16.010+/-0.013 (using gri -> R Lupton transformations).
