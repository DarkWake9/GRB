At 11:04:44.5 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and 
located on-board GRB050416 (trigger #114753).  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is RA, dec 188.478, 21.043 (J2000) with an 
uncertainty of 3.00 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including estimated 
systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve shows double 
structures with a duration of about three seconds. The peak 
count rate measured by BAT was about 3000 counts/sec in the 15 -
350 keV band.  The burst signal is mostly seen in 15-50 keV.  

The XRT observed the target field at 11:06:12 UT and detected 17 counts in  
a single CCD frame, just under the number needed for a reliable on-board  
centroid.  Initial indications based on the raw spectra and lightcurve  
transmitted via TDRSS suggest that there is a real X-ray source in the  
field.  We will issue an update following the next ground station pass at  
12:18 UT.
