The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

We have performed the off-line analysis of the LIGO data around
the time of the burst event G274296 using the Coherent WaveBurst
(Klimenko et al., PRD 93, 042004 (2016)) with a better estimation
of the background. The new estimated FAR is one event in 6 months.
The low significance of this candidate is not expected to improve
with further analysis.

An updated localization,  skyprobcc_cWB_170629.fits, is available for
retrieval
from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G274296

This is the preferred sky map at this time. The localization is consistent
with the previous sky map, however, its error region is smaller due to
improved
calculation of the coherent Waveburst skymaps for the low SNR events.
The 50% credible region spans 245 deg2 and the 90% credible region spans
1153 deg2.

Further updates on our analysis of this event will be sent as they become
available.
