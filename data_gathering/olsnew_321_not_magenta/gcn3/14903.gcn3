Shaolin Xiong (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 23:56:09.74 UT on 14 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130614A (trigger 392946972 / 130614997).

High peak flux from the GRB caused GBM to issue a repoint request
that reoriented the satellite to place the GRB near the LAT boresight
for 2.5 hours, subject to Earth limb contraints.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 324.18, DEC = -33.89 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 21 h 36 m, -33 d 53 '), with an uncertainty
of 1.2 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a 'FRED' shape pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 9.3 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+9.4 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.45 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 101 +/- 5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.1 +/- 0.2)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.19 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 20.7 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
