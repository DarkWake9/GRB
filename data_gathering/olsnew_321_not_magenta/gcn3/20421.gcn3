We observed the field of the optical transient ATLAS17aeu (Tonry et al.,
LVC GCN 20382; Kasliwal et al., GCN 20398) that is within the error region
of LIGO/Virgo G268556 (LVC, GCN 20364) with the 2.4-m GMG telescope at the
Lijiang Observatory in Yunnan, China. We obtained an R-band image with the
Yunnan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (YFOSC) on 2017-01-07 14:55:35
UT. ATLAS17aeu was not detected with a 3-sigma limit of about R~23 mag.

ATLAS17aeu was detected with i=21.9 mag on 2017-01-07 08:05:33 UT (Kasliwal
et al., GCN 20398) and was proposed to be the afterglow of GRB 170105A. Our
observation indicates that the source is fainter than the suggested
power-law decay. However, due to the use of different filters in ATLAS,
Palomar, and Lijiang, the lightcurve should be treated with caution.
