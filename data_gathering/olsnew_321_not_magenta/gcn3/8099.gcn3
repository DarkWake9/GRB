C. Guidorzi (INAF-OAB), D. Bersier (LJMU) and N. Tanvir (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 080810 (Page et al. GCN Circ. 8080) with the 2 m Liverpool
and Faulkes North telescopes starting on August 11 (23:34:09 UT) and
12 (13:14:49 UT), respectively, with r' and i' filters.
We clearly detect the afterglow with the following magnitudes:

Telescope   Filter  T_mid[hr]   Exposure[s]      Mag
-------------------------------------------------------------
LT          i'        34.657       6x300       20.01 ± 0.06
LT          r'        39.525       6x300       20.78 ± 0.05
FTN         i'        48.367       5x300       20.38 ± 0.04
-------------------------------------------------------------

The calibration was performed using nearby USNOB1 stars as described
in our previous report (Guidorzi et al. GCN Circ. 8093).
Combining with our previous observation, we derive a power-law index
of 0.94 ± 0.05 from 15 to 48 hr post burst, thus confirming the
flattening of the optical decay, in agreement with Galeev et al.
(GCN Circ. 8098).
