Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the fields of GRB 131128A (Sonbas et al., GCN 15533),
using the 1m telescope located on Mt. Nanshan, Xinjiang, China.
Observations started 880s after the Swift trigger and a series of
R-band frames were obtained.

An optical source is clearly detected at coordinates:

R.A. (J2000) = 23:41:13.75
Dec.(J2000) = +31:18:23.14

Error Radius: ~1 arcsec

which is consistent with the SPER XRT position of this burst
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/), thus it's likely the afterglow of the
GRB.

Note that there is a very bright star (r=14.76 mag from SDSS) just a
few arcsec away from this optical transient. Observations are ongoing.
