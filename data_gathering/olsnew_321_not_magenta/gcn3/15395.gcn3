We observed GRB131011A (GCN 15324) with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array at 34GHz for 55 minutes centered on 11:20UT  Oct-17-2013 in
poor weather.

We detect no radio source at the optical location of the GRB and place a
3sigma upper limit of 120uJy on the flux of an
afterglow.

These observations were obtained as part of ATCA project C2689. We
thank the observatory staff for their support and scheduling the
observations. The Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of
Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
