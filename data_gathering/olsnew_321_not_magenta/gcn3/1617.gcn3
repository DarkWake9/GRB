K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 25250 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~30 s,
a 25-100 keV fluence of 8.5E-5 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux over 0.5 s of 1.3E-5 erg/cm2 s.  We have
triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered
at RA, Decl (2000)=175.616, 36.839 degrees, whose
radius is 14.065+/-0.126 degrees.

This annulus can be constrained further, but at this
point it is not clear whether the event was observed
by Mars Odyssey, and thus whether an error box can
be derived for it.
