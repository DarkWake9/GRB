the Swift team:

Swift has carried out further observations of S191216ap. We performed a
series of tiles to cover the HAWC error region (GCN Circ. 26472) for
500 s per tile, and then 3ks observations of each of the galaxies
listed by Singer et al (GCN Circ. 26479). All of the Swift pointings
and associated metadata have been reported to the Treasure Map (Wyatt
et al., GCN Circ. 26244;
http://treasuremap.space/alerts?graceids=S191216ap).

In these observations, we detected 17 X-ray sources, these are either
new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the last
circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes how
likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 13 sources of rank 3
  * 4 sources of rank 4


RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.

RANK 4 sources
==============

These are catalogued X-ray sources, showing no signs of outburst
compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.

| Source ID	 | RA		  | Dec 	   | Err90   |
| S191216ap_X11  | 21h 32m 41.01s | +04d 24' 18.6" |	6.2" |

| S191216ap_X16  | 21h 31m 22.64s | +05d 02' 37.5" |	5.4" |

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3x10^20 cm^-2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7
