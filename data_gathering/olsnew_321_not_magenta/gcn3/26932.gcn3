The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 09:48:44 UT on 29 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200129A (trigger 601984129.18217 / 200129409).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 346.3, Dec = -45.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 05m, -45d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 111.0 degrees.
