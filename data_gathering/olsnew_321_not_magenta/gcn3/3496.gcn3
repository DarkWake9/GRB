At 04:06:45 UT on May 28, 2005 the BAT instrument on the Swift
spacecraft triggered on (trigger = 130679) and located possible
GRB 050528.  The BAT on-board calculated location is RA 353.529d
{+23h 34m 07s} (J2000),  +45.944d {+45d 56' 37"} (J2000) with
an uncertainty of 4 arc minutes (radius, 3-sigma, including systematic
uncertainty).

Due to the temporary lack of BAT lightcurves and engineering work on the
XRT, there is no additional information on this burst at this time.
We can not say if this is a real GRB or not.  The full data set from
the next available Malindi downlink will be available at approximately
10:00 UT.   A burst validity statement will be made at that time.
