K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of GRB 050716 (Rol et al. GCN 3623) was observed by
the Automated Response Telescope. The observation started at 2005 July
16 12:38:26 UT (142 s after the trigger) and BVRcIc frames of 60s
integration were acquired.

 We do not detect an optical counterpart of the X-ray afterglow (GCN
3623, 3624) and derive its 3-sigma upper limit relative to
USNO-B1.0 magnitude as follows.
