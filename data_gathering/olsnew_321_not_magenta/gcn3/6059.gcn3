A. Pelangeon & J-L. Atteia (LATT-OMP) report:

We provide an improved computation of the pseudo-redshift** of GRB 070125
(Hurley et al., GCNC 6024), based on the spectral parameters measured by 
KONUS
(Golenetskii et al. GCNC 6049, and Val'Palshin, Ioffe Physico-Technical 
Inst., private communication).

We find a pseudo-redshift pz= 1.3 ± 0.3

This value is more precise than the value of pz= 1.6 ± 0.8 (GCNC 6033)
that we have obtained with the spectral parameters measured by RHESSI
(Bellm et al. GCNC 6025).

We provide this new estimate as a contribution to the on-going debate
on the distance of GRB 070125.

We thank V. Pal'shin for having kindly performed the spectral analysis 
of KONUS data.
