report on behalf of the GRANDMA collaboration.

We performed galaxy-targeted observations of the LIGO/Virgo event
S191213g event (GCN #26402) with the amator astronomers
of GRANDMA citizen science program "kilonova-catcher" created
by CNRS/IRAP and CNRS/LAL [1].

Denis St-Gelais and Marc Serrau performed galaxy-targeted
observations in clear filter of the S191213g event.
Denis St-Gelais imaged 12 fields with a 36-cm telescope located
in Quer√©taro (Mexico). Marc Serrau imaged 1 field with a 28-cm telescope
located near Haute Provence Observatory (France). The typical magnitude
is 19 for both sites with an exposure time of 26 min and 76 min
respectively.

The target galaxies are selected from the list of potential host
galaxies from the Mangrove catalog [2] in the 90% credible area of the
localization region of the LIGO/Virgo GW event (LALInference skymap 
created on 2019-12-14 00:59:57 UTC).


No significant transient candidates were found during our analysis [3].

The list of the galaxies we observed is given in the table below.
TStart and TEnd refers respectively to the time of the first and last
exposure for a given galaxy. Observations are not necessarily continuous
in this interval.
