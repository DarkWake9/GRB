S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, 
D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER NS GRB team, and

V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, and V. Pelassa, on behalf of the Fermi
GBM team, report:

GRB140801A (Fermi trigger 428612396) has been observed by Konus-Wind,
Fermi-GBM, and MESSENGER, so far, at around 68393 SOD (18:59:53) UT.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma annulus centered at
RA, Dec (2000)=123.886, +21.098 degrees, whose radius is 70.951 +/-
0.125 degrees.  The bright MASTER OT (Gorbovskoy et al. GCN 16653) lies
0.0093 degrees from the center line of this annulus, and is therefore
likely to be the optical afterglow of this GRB.

A map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/140801A.  This localization
may be improved.

The spectral and temporal properties of this GRB will be given in
forthcoming GCN Circulars.
