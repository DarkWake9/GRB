"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060807 (GCN 5409) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 14:44:19 UT on Aug. 8.
After co-adding a set of 44 images (14:44:19 - 15:52:33 UT,
164s after the trigger) of 30 sec exposures,
we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.

Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 17.6 mag. "
