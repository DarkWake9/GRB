A. M. Soderberg, P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and D. A. Frail
(NRAO) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie collaboration:

"We have undertaken additional VLA observations of GRB050724 (GCN 3665) on
2005 July 26.21 UT. The flux density of the radio source, identified in
GCN 3676, has varied significantly between these two epochs.

This radio variability, together with the close proximity of the radio
source with the XRT position (GCN 3676; chance coincidence<0.15%), and
the optical variations noted in GCN 3681, argue that this is the afterglow
of GRB050724. Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
