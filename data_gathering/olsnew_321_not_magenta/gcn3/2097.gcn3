E.Pavlenko, V.Rumyantsev, O.Antoniuk, N.Primak  (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI)
report:

The OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985)  was imaged Cassegrain 38-cm
telescope of CrAO.  Several 300 sec. exposures in  R (Johnson)  obtained
during Apr. 4.  Based on filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN 2023)  we
estimate the OT magnitude:

Mid time                      exposure       R
(UT)

 Apr 4.7686                  4x300c        18.12 +/-0.11
       4.8236                  5x300Ó        18.32 +/-0.10
       4.8412                  5x300c        18.04 +/-0.07

After nearly flat period between end of 030402 and end of 030403 (GCN
2083,2084,2092) the OT definitely start  a new fading phase. A power-law
index between Apr 3.8160 and  Apr 4.8049  can be estimated as alpha ~1.7

A 10x180 sec. exposure image obtained on April 04.8012 can be found in
