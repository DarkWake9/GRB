A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:46:20.36 UT on 11 October 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 141011A (trigger 434702783 / 141011282).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
that was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 254.9, DEC = -8.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 16h 59m, -08d 18'), with an uncertainty
of 2.7 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a short structured pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.16 s to T0+0.080 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.50 +/- 0.09 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 603 (+78/-63)keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.05 +/- 0.05)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 0.016-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.16 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 70 +/- 4 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with 
Epeak= 573 (+90/-75) keV, alpha = -0.5 +/- 0.1 and beta = -2.7 (+0.4/-4.2).

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
