report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:24:42.74 UT on 15 July 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220715B (trigger 679616687 / 220715934), which was
also detected by the Swift/BAT (E. Troja et al. 2022, GCN 32405)

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 32404) is consistent with
the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 69
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 40 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.024 s to T0+43.008 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.09 +/- 0.23  and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 118 +/- 28 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.2 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
