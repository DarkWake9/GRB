J. L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) and D. Kocevski (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team: 

At 17:19:39 on September 10, 2016 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 160910A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 495220782/160910722; Veres et al. GCN #19901). 

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be
RA, Dec = 221.26, 38.76 (J2000)
with an error radius of 0.35 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only). 

The GBM location was initially at the edge of the LAT field of view at an angle of 71 degrees to the LAT boresight and triggered an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.  The highest-energy photon is a 500 MeV event which is observed 9 ks after the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Dan Kocevski (daniel.kocevski@nasa.gov). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
