TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4329
SUBJECT: GRB 051211: TAROT optical limits
DATE:    05/12/12 00:23:57 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), and Atteia, J.L. (LAT-OMP) report:

We imaged the entire field of GRB 051211 (H3979) detected by HETE-2
(Atteia et al. GCNC 4324) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France. Observations started 8.1
seconds after the GCN notice (and 3.14 hours after the GRB). The field
had an elevation of 33 degrees above horizon at the begining of the
observations and then decreased.

Two images of 90s were co-added. We compared the 3 arcmin field
centred on the HETE-2/SXC error box with stars of the USNO-B1
catalog. No new source appears brighter than R=15.3.
