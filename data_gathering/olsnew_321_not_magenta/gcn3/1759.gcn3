We have continued to observe the afterglow of GRB 021211
with the MMT plus MiniCam imager (GCN 1750). R-band images
obtained Dec. 13.4 and Dec. 14.4 (UT) in 0.8" seeing
clearly show the afterglow and a rapid fading. From PSF
fitting photometry, we estimate the power-law decay index
between Dec. 12 and  Dec. 14 is 1.03+/-0.14. This is
consistent with the decay rate measured by Chornock et al.
(GCN 1754) beginning 12 minutes after the burst.

Combining the three epochs allows a clear detection of
the possible host galaxy noted on GCN 1750 (also GCN 1758).
A galaxy centered 1.5" north and east of the afterglow
is cleanly separated from the optical transient . It has an
approximate brightness of R=24.8. This is likely the source
of emission lines found by Vreeswijk et al. (GCN 1756)
at a redshift of z=0.80. Another galaxy of similar brightness
is detected 2.7" north of the burst.
