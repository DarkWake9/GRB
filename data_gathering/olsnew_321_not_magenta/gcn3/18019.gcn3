The long-duration GRB 150710B (Swift-BAT ground detection:
Cummings et al., GCN 18009)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=29133.922 s UT (08:05:33.922).

The KW light curve shows a multi-peaked emission complex with
a total duration of ~8.5 s.
The emission is visible up to ~5 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB150710_T29133/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of 1.1(-0.2,+0.2)x10^-5 erg/cm2, and a 64-ms peak flux,
measured from T0+4.032 s, of 6.8(-1.3,+1.2)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.81 (-0.23,+0.30),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.27 (-0.33,+0.18),
the peak energy Ep = 154 (-30,+37) keV,
chi2 = 75/97 dof.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
