V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), V. Kumar (IUCAA), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), S. Vadawale (PRL)  report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of Astrosat data showed the detection of GRB 160525C (Sakamoto
et al., GCN 19471; Konus Wind trigger time 10:54:28.0 UT) in CZTI data.
The source was clearly detected in the 40-240 keV energy range. The
light curve shows a complex structure, with the strongest peak at UT
10:54:23 and a peak count rate of 640 counts/sec above the background
(four quadrants summed together), with a total of 2796 counts. The local
mean background count rate of 86.2 is counts/sec. Using cumulative
rates, we measure a T90 of 5.1 sec.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=node/9 . CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and
facilitated the project.
