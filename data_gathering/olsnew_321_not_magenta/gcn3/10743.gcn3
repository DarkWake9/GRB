Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), G. Grant
Williams (MMTO), and Peter A. Milne (Steward Observatory) report:

We observed the field of Swift trigger 421695 (Sbarufatti et al., GCN
10737) with the 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope located at KPNO beginning 21
seconds after the trigger.  Within the BAT error circle, we detect no new
sources to a limiting magnitude of R = 17.5 (as compared to the USNO B1.0
catalog) in our first 3 minutes of stacked exposures.
