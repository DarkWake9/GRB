"The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North robotically followed up GRB060116
(SWIFT trigger 177533) 18.5 min after the GRB trigger time.
The 4.6'x 4.6' field of view covered about 75% of the BAT error circle. 
The automatic "detection mode" procedure did not find any afterglow
candidate brighter than R~19 mag (vs USNOB1) from a 3x10s exposure.
The visual extinction of the field is A_V~0.8 according
to the Schlegel et al. maps.
Further automated observations were conducted immediately following the
"detection mode" exposures in B, R and SDSS-I filters.
Manual inspection of subsequent datasets
reveals no afterglow candidate down to the DSS limit."
