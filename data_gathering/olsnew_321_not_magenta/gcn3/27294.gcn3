The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:34:23 UT on 3 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200303A (trigger 604895668.847358 / 200303107).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 207.4, Dec = 50.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 49m, 50d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
