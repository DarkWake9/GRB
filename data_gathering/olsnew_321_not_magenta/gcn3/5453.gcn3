FROM:    Antonino Cucchiara at PSU  <cucchiara@astro.psu.edu>

A. Cucchiara and A. Moretti report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began observing GRB 060814 (trigger #224552,
A. Moretti et al., GCN Circ. 5447) 80 seconds after the BAT
trigger. No optical afterglow is detected in the XRT refined error
circle (A. Moretti et al, GCN Circ. 5451).

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for the finding chart and the
coadded images for the UVOT filters are listed below:

Finding chart:

White         80-178         98              19.70

Coadded images:

Filter        T_range (s)    Exposure (s)    3sigma UL

V             180-12176      2008            20.36
B             388-25364      2085            21.53
U             364-24651      2310            21.04
W1            340-23738      2138            20.52
M2            285-13073      1080            20.50
W2            416-7882       349             20.02

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. No correction has
been made for the Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.04 mag
(Schlegel et al. 1998) along the line of sight to the burst.
