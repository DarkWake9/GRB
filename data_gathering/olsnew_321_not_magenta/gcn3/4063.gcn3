Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink, we report
further analysis of Swift-BAT Trigger #158593 (Norris, et al., GCN 4061).
The ground-analysis position is RA,Dec 110.808,+9.510
{7h 23m 13.8s,+9d 30' 36.3"} (J2000) with an uncertainty
of 1.7 arcmin (radius, 90%, stat+sys).  T90 is 26 +- 1 sec.
The lightcurve has an initial cluster of 3 overlapping peaks at T-5 to T+8 sec
and a fourth peak at T+20 sec.  Fitting a simple power law
over the full interval from T-5.9 to T+24.7 sec, the photon index
is 1.4 +/- 0.2 with a fluence of 1.28 +/- 0.13 X 10^-6 erg/cm^2.
The peak flux in a 1-sec wide window starting at T+3.2 sec
is 1.9 +/- 0.3 ph/cm^2/sec.  All values are in the 15-150 keV band
at the 90% confidence level.
