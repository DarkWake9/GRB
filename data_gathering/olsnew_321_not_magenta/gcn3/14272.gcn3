A. Cucchiara (UCSC/UCO Lick Observatory), S. B. Cenko 
(UC Berkeley), D. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of 
a large collaboration:

"On March 7.21 UT we observed the field of GRB 130305A 
(Cummings & Palmer, GCN 14257; Yu & Xiong, GCN 14261; 
Guiriec et al., GCN 14260) with the Gemini-North telescope
equipped with the GMOS camera.

We obtained 14x180s exposures, for a total integration time
of 42 minutes (T_mid = T0+1.70 days). No clear object is 
detected within the XRT error circle down to r' > 26.1 mag.

Nevertheless we note the presence of several galaxies
just outside the current XRT error circle (2.7 arcsec radius), 
in particular of a relatively bright object in the S-W direction, 
which seems to show a distorted morphology 
(https://www.dropbox.com/s/pyir6g8mqd658xn/GRB130305A.jpeg). 
The galaxy coordinates are

RA: 07:46:58.9  (J2000)
Dec: +52:01:55.72 (J2000)


We thank the Gemini staff for performing this observations,
in particular J. Rhee."
