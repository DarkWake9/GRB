on behalf of the Swift UVOT team.


Swift/UVOT observed GRB 050820B in its UV filters only, due to the 
presence of a
V=4.5 star in its field of view.  The afterglow was not detected at the 
XRT position.
5-sigma upper limits are:


Filter     Magnitude      Exp (s)   T_start    T_stop
UVM2         >19.1         100       1987       2087
UVW1         >19.0         100       2091       2191
UVW2         >19.3         100       2198       2298

where T_start and T_stop are in seconds after the trigger (Page et al. 
GCN 3839).
