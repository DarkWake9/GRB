Using the full data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report final analysis of BAT GRB 130609B (trigger #557828)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 14841; Lien at al., GCN Circ. 14862).

In addition to the peaks described in Lien at al., GCN Circ. 14862, we report
that there is a small peak in the BAT at around T+270 sec, coincident with a
second flare in the XRT.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 210.6 +- 15.1 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.8 to T+307.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.32 +- 0.04.  The fluence and peak photon flux are as reported in GCN Circ. 
14862. The quoted error is at the 90% confidence level.

The results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at
