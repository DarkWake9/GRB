A. Klotz (IRAP, CNRS/UPS), and M. Boer (ARTEMIS, CNRS/OCA/UNS) report on 
behalf of the TZAC collaboration:

We have reduced and analysed the whole set of images acquired from 
TAROT-Chile (see LV GCN 18348, 18332 for the field coordinates and 
observing log). Depending on the field, the final limits are between R 
 >18.5 and 19.8. If we take a conservative limit of R> 18.5 at 2.8 days 
after the GW event, this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 19.6 at 
the distance of GW 150914.
