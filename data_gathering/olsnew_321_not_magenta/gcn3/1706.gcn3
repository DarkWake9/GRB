TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1706
SUBJECT: GRB021125 : A long GRB localized by INTEGRAL
DATE:    02/11/26 15:04:05 GMT
FROM:    INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>

A. Bazzano, A. Paizis and the INTEGRAL Science Team
report the detection of GRB021125 at 17:58:30 UTC
of duration 20 sec in IBIS field of view with ISGRI and PICsIT
detectors.

The event is confirmed by the SPI anticoincidence system. The most
probable preliminary position is RA 19h 47m and DEC +28.1deg.

The position uncertainty is entirely systematics and estimated
to be 30 arcmin at this early stage of INTEGRAL commissioning.

A refined position will be published as soon as possible.

The burst peak intensity was about 2-4 Crab in the energy range 15-120 keV.
