Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151127A (trigger #665268)
(D'Ai, et al., GCN Circ. 18643).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 19.664, -82.762 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 18m 39.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -82d 45' 42.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at T_zero and
ending at ~T+0.25 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.19 +- 0.04 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.016 to T+0.220 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.26 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.6 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.38 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
