S. W. K Emery (UCL-MSSL), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 06:48:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered (trigger #847216). 
However, we believe that this was an erroneous trigger due to a known race
condition in the Swift/BAT software, which causes BAT to misidentify 
IGR J16385-2057 as a different source (Trigger 847216). The full ground 
data is required to confirm the nature of this trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift did not slew immediately to the
location of this trigger. Thus there will be no prompt XRT or UVOT
data. A delayed slew will be executed.
