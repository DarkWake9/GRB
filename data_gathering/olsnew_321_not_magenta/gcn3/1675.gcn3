At 07:01:02.93 UTC (25262.93 s UT) on 4 Nov 2002, the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments detected event H2434, a long, X-ray-rich GRB.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a location,
which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 9:47 UT, 166 minutes
after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 5.  The WXM location
can be expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle that is approximately
24 arcminutes in width and 42 arcminutes in length.  The corners of
the rectangle lie at the following J2000 coordinates:

RA = 3h 52m 40.3s, Dec = 38o 19' 26"
RA = 3h 54m 44.6s, Dec = 38o 17' 10"
RA = 3h 54m 56.2s, Dec = 37o 34' 59"
RA = 3h 52m 52.6s, Dec = 37o 37' 12".

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was ~26s.  A total of 2120
counts were detected during that interval, corresponding to a fluence
of ~4 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 . The peak flux was >3 x 10-8 ergs cm-2 s-1
(i.e., >1 x Crab flux).
