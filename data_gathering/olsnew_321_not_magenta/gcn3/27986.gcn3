The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:48:43 UT on 19 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200619B (trigger 614260128.085724 / 200619492).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 200.4, Dec = -45.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 21m, -45d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54.0 degrees.
