The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:31:16 UT on 9 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200709A (trigger 615958281.763912 / 200709147).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 119.9, Dec = -53.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 59m, -53d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 115.0 degrees.
