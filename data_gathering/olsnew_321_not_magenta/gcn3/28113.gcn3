The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:34:28 UT on 16 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200716B (trigger 616577673.479748 / 200716316).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.4, Dec = -15.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 57m, -15d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67.0 degrees.
