University and Bologna Astronomical Observatory), F. Giovannelli 
(Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale-CNR) and G. Pizzichini (IASF-CNR, 
Sezione di Bologna) report: 

On 2002 August 12, 20h18m35s UT we started observations of the error box 
of GRB 020812 (GCN 1468) with the 152 cm telescope in Loiano, (R band, 
2x600 + 2x780 + 10x900 sec exposures). Observations of the field ended on 
August 13, 01h49m42s UT.
Coverage of the entire error box was performed two times.
By visual inspection in our frames there is no new source brighter than 
the limit of DssII.
The field containing the brigt object mentioned in GCN 1479 was imaged on 
August 12, 21h17m54s UT, i.e. 2.5 hours after the detection of the possible
afterglow candidate. Our frame, somewhat deeper than DssII, does not reveal 
any new object. 
Our images can be retrieved by sftp at 'ermione.bo.astro.it', 
username 'publicGRB', password 'GRB_bo', starting on August 16.
