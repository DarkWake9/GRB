We observed the field of GRB 131031A (Cummings et al., GCN 15421) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/11 1.21 to 2013/11 1.48 UTC (17.44
to 23.99 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.47 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.81 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

The source within the XRT error circle (Gompertz et al., GCN 15424) and 
confirmed by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 15426) is clearly detected. 
In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we
obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

 r	22.38 +/- 0.07
 i	22.34 +/- 0.09
 Z	21.89 +/- 0.14
 Y	> 21.81
 J	> 21.36 
 H	> 20.69 

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
