TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2868
SUBJECT: GRB041219: Prompt Optical Observations from ROTSE-IIIb
DATE:    04/12/19 04:11:28 GMT
FROM:    Eli Rykoff at Univ. of Michigan/ROTSE  <erykoff@umich.edu>

E. Rykoff (U. Michigan) and R. Quimby (U. Texas) report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded automatically to
INTEGRAL trigger #2073, GRB041219.  Our first 5-s exposure started at 01:44:11.6
UT, 74 seconds after the start of the GRB, and 6 seconds after the trigger, and
during the GRB itself (GCN 2866).  Our unfiltered images were calibrated
relative to USNO A2.0. Comparison to DSS reveals no new sources to a limiting
magnitude of around 17.2.  Due to the low galactic latitude, field crowding is
a significant issue. Imaging is ongoing.
