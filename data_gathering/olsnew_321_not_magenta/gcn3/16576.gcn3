TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16576
SUBJECT: GRB 140710B: a long GRB detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    14/07/10 23:59:31 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at CEA  <diego.gotz@cea.fr>

D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, D. Malishev (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:
a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 21:37:30 UT of July 10, 2014. Due to a S/W maintenance problem at ISDC no refined coordinates can currently be computed. So the automatic coordinates should be considered at this time. Refined coordinates will be posted as soon as the attitude files will be available again. The automatic coordinates are:

R.A.=  204.657 deg
DEC.=  -58.5854  deg

with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux of about 1.2 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 1e-6 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
