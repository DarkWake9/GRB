Using the data set from T-61 to T+191 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121117A (trigger #538696)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 13967).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 31.617, 7.432 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  02h 06m 28.1s
    Dec(J2000) = +07d 25' 55.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak.  Swift was close to
the SAA and BAT entered SAA mode about 250 seconds after the trigger.  T90
(15-350 keV) is 30 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+158.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.16 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
