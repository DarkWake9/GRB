The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:01:22 UT on 9 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200909A (trigger 621316887.38726 / 200909168).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 338.9, Dec = -16.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 35m, -16d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 104.0 degrees.
