report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-06-13T10:47:00.00 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190613B (trigger ID: HEB190613449) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (GCN #24806) and Swift/BAT 
(D'Ai et al. 2019, GCN #24807). 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of two 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 3.59 s measured from T0-0.56 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+2.09 s, is 2847 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 6013 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
