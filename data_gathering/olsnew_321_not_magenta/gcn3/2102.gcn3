V.Metlov (Crimean Laboratory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute,
Moscow State University) report:
I have made photographic observations of the GRB030329 OT found by B.A.Peterson
and P.A.Price (GCN 1985) with 50-cm Maksutov telescope in Crimea.
Exposures: 60 minutes and 50 minutes in B and V filters accordingly.
Based on filed photometry presented in GCN 2023 by A.Henden (12 stars were used 
to do the calibration) I estimate the OT magnitudes:

UT, Apr 2		filter	  mag	 err

19:33:00 - 20:33:00       B      18.15   0.15
