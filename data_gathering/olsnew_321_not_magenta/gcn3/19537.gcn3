report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:12:48 UT on 2016-06-12, a number of gamma ray instruments, including
Swift-BAT, detected the short-hard GRB 160612A (Burns et al., GCN Circ. 19531).
BAT was slewing to a pre-planned target at that time, so it did not immediately
trigger.  However, ground analysis of the slew data reveals the GRB location
of RA, dec = 348.364, -25.375 which is
 RA(J2000) = 23h 13m 27s
 dec(J2000) = -25d 22' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This position is consistent with the IPN error box 
(Kozlova, GCN Circ 19535).  The lightcurve shows a short, complex peak
with a duration of T90 = 0.25 seconds and a peak count rate of 
~18,000 counts/s (15-350 keV)..

The time-averaged spectrum over the T90 interval is best fit by a
simple power-law model, with a photon index of 0.74+/-0.17
and a fluence in the 15-150 keV band of 1.16 +/- 0.12 x 10^-7
erg/cm^2.  All quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level

Swift ToO observations are underway (GCN 19536).
