"The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely Long GRB.

At 10:49:49 UT on 12 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200212A (trigger 603197394.1517 / 200212451). 

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 124.8, Dec = 23.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 19m, 23d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.7 degrees. 

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
