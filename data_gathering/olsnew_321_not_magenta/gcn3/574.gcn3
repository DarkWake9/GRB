D. A. Frail and G. B. Taylor (NRAO) report:

"We imaged the IPN error box of GRB000301A (GCN #567) with the VLA at
frequencies of 4.86 GHz and 8.46 GHz, starting on March 3.86 UT. The
radio source reported by Rol et al. (GCN #569) is visible. We obtain
an improved position of (J2000) r.a.= 23 39 47.51 (+/-0.05), dec. =
+75 46 14.5 (+/-0.2). The VLA flux density at 4.86 GHz is 408+/-61
microJy, consistent with that measured at WSRT 30 hrs earlier. The
8.46 GHz flux density is 432+/-68 microJy, and indicates a flat
spectrum. A search of the NRAO All Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et
al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) shows that the VLA observed in this direction
at a frequency of 1.4 GHz on 1993 October 20. At the position of the
radio source there is a weak (2.5-sigma) NVSS source with a flux
density of 1.1+/-0.45 milliJy.

The absence of significant variability, the flat spectrum and the
possible identification of a NVSS source at this position, makes it
unlikely that the radio source is related to GRB 000301A."
