report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:10:12.86 UT on 01 January 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160101B (trigger 473317816 / 160101215).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 1.4, DEC = 55.2 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 0 h 5 m, 55 d 14 '), with an uncertainty
of 1.4 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 9 degrees.


The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 6.9 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.5 s to T0+6.7 s is
adequately  fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.33 +/- 0.07 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 952 +/- 468 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.73 +/- 0.14)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
