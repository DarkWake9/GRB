Observatory Team:

At 15:41:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180705A (trigger=846299).  Swift did not slew due to an observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 212.594, -11.630, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 10m 23s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 37' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time light
curve does not show anything significant. The image trigger significance is 7.8
sigma, therefore we have high confidence in this event. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+54
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Stamatikos (Michael.Stamatikos-1 AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
