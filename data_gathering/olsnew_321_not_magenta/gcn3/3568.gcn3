J. Haislip, C. MacLeod, M. Nysewander, A. Foster, J. A. Crain, D. Reichart,
M. Bayliss, J. Kirschbrown, and C. Mack report on behalf of the UNC team of
the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the BAT localization of GRB 050525a (Band et al., GCN 3466)
with PROMPT-5 beginning 5.3 hours after the burst.  We detect the afterglow
(Rykoff et al., GCN 3465) in VRcIc across multiple epochs.

Using the field calibration of Nysewander et al. (GCN 3566), we find that
Rc = 19.84 +/- 0.11 mag at a mean time of 8.1 hours after the burst.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
