Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink, further
analysis of Swift-BAT GRB 050713A (Trigger #145675; Falcone et al., GCN
Circ 3581) yields a refined position of RA, Dec 320.587, +77.070 {21h
22m 21s, +77d 04' 12"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% confidence, statistical+systematic).

The burst duration (T90) was determined to be 70 +/- 10 seconds (15-350
keV) starting at T-1.0 seconds.  There is an initial ~12 second long basically
square hump which shows some structure:  three separate peaks of roughly
equal intensity in the 15-50 keV energy band, but falling in intensity with time
above 100 keV.  There are additional, much smaller peaks at T-60, T+50
T+65, and T+105 seconds.

The spectrum over the interval from T-70 to T+121 seconds can be fit
with a power law with photon index 1.58 +/- 0.07 and yields a fluence of
9.1 +/- 0.6 X 10^-6 erg/cm^2 in the 15-350 keV band.  The peak flux
in a 1-sec wide window starting at T+1.2 seconds is 6.0 +/- 0.4 ph/cm^2/sec.
