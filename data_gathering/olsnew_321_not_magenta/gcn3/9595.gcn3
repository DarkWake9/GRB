S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks,
P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov, and D. Svinkin on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and Konus-RF teams, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long bright GRB 090626 localized by IPN and Fermi/LAT (Golenetskii 
et al., GCN 9588; Piron et al., GCN 9584; corresponding to the Fermi/GBM
trigger 267683530: von Kienlin, GCN 9579) triggered Konus-Wind at 
T0(KW)=16330.962 s UT (04:32:10.962) and Konus-RF at T0(KRF)=16332.013 s 
UT (04:32:12.013).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a duration of
~60 s

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 7.78(-1.01, +0.91)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+21.056 s
of 1.41(-0.25, +0.24)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 7 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+61.696 s) can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 7 MeV
range) by GRB (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.26(-0.08, +0.09),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.43(-0.54, +0.20),
the peak energy Ep = 202(-24, +29) keV (chi2 = 98.7/78 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
