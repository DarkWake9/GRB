We observed the field of GRB 171120A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 22133) 
using the 2.16-m telescope located at Xinglong, Hebei, China, equipped 
with BFOSC. We obtained 1x600s and 2x900s R-band frames, starting at 
18:54:02 UT on 2017-11-20, i.e., 5.57 hr after the BAT trigger.

No optical source was detected in the stacked image at the XRT position 
(Evens et al., GCN 22135), down to the limiting magnitude of R~21.5 mag 
at the median time of 5.95 hr post-burst, calibrated with the SDSS field.
