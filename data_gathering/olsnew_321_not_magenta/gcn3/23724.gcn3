Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190114C (trigger #883832)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 23688).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 54.503, -26.938 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  03h 38m 00.7s
  Dec(J2000) = -26d 56' 17.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts at
~T-7 s. The brightest emission contains two complex pulses and ends at ~T+50 s.
Afterwards, the emission appeared to decay exponentially out to beyond ~T+720 s,
when the burst went out of the BAT field of view. The burst did not come back into the
BAT field of view until ~T+3800, and nothing significant was detected at that time.
T90 (15-350 keV) estimated using data before the burst went out of the BAT field of view
 is 361.5 +- 11.7 sec (estimated error including systematics). Please note that this
T90 might be an underestimate.

The time-averaged spectrum from -6.604 to 703.192 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.43 +- 0.02.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 101.0 +- 1.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
