Using the data set from T-240 to T+754 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060923B (trigger #230702)
(Stamitikos, et al., GCN Circ. 5590).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 238.193, -30.907 deg {15h 52m 46.3s, -30d 54' 25.8"} (J2000)
+- 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 36%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve has a single peak starting at T-1 sec
and ending at T+10 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.8 +- 0.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+9.9 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 2.53 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.8 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.93 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
