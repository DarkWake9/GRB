GRB team report:

A short hard intense GRB 050112 was detected
by Konus-Wind at 11:10:22.358 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 11:10:24.351 UT.
It was also detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.
It consisted of two separate pulses, first of which
was multipeaked and had a duration of ~0.150 s,
the second contained a single peak and had a duration of ~0.080 s.
The time separation between pulses was about 0.3 s.
The total duration of the burst was about 0.52 s.

We have triangulated it to Wind-Helicon annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 297.993 deg, Decl(2000) = -16.680 deg,
whose radius is 68.634 ± 0.045 deg (3 sigma)
and Wind-Integral annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 300.904 deg, Decl(2000) = -18.663 deg,
whose radius is 69.489 ± 0.192 deg (3 sigma).

These annuli intersect to form 2 error boxes,
one of which may be eliminated by the Konus
ecliptic latitude response.

The resulting error box has an approximate
area of ~1300 sq. arcmin.  Its coordinates are:

		     RA(2000)   DEC(2000)
   ERROR BOX CENTER:   221.935  -42.778
   ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 222.084  -40.378
   ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 221.620  -46.583
   ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 221.831  -45.150
   ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 222.347  -38.905


As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a
fluence  ~1.0x10^-5 erg/cm2, a peak flux ~1.6x10^-4 erg/cm2 s
(both in 20-5000 keV range), and a Ep ~700 keV
