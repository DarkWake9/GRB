A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR)  and Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) report:

We carried out the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 1400903A (Cummings et al. GCN 16763) in the 1390 MHz band on 2014
September 11.05 UT. We detect a 3.1-sigma source at the GRB position 
(Cenko et al.
16770) with a flux density of 102+/-33 uJy. This is most likely the 
radio afterglow of
GRB 140903A. We are carrying out further observations to confirm this 
detection.

We thank GMRT staff for making these observations possible.
