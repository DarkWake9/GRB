We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 140430A (Siegel et al., GCN 
16190) with the ESO VLT equipped with X-shooter. Observations started at 
23:09 UT on 2014 April 30 (2.5 hr after the GRB), still in twilight, and 
two 10-minute spectra were secured. The covered wavelength range is 
3000-25000 AA.

We detect a clear continuum, and several absorption features, which we 
interpret as due, among others, to Si II, C IV, Al II, Fe II, and Mg II 
at a common redshift z = 1.60. In the infrared arm, we also detect the 
[O III] 5008 nebular line in emission at the same redshift.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff at Paranal, in 
particular Andrea Mehner, Rodrigo Romero, and Stephane Brillant.
