S. Piranomonte (INAF/OAR), D. Malesani (SISSA), A. Pizzella, J. 
Mendez-Abreu, L. Lessio (INAF/OAPd), I. Yegorova (SISSA), and N. Masetti 
(INAF/IASF Bo) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the possible GRB 060203 (Swift trigger 180151; 
Retter et al., GCN 4641) using the 182 cm Copernico telescope located in 
Asiago (Italy), equipped with the AFOSC camera. Our images were taken in 
the R filter, under moderate conditions (seeing 1.8 arcsec, thin cirrus).

Coaddition of three exposures lasting 10 minutes each one (mean time Feb 
4.067 UT, 1.6 h after the trigger) reveals no new sources with respect 
to the DSS 2, which reaches a comparable depth.
