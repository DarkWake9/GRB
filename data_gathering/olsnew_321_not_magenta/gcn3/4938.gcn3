report:

At 06:41:42 UTC on March 31, 2006 HETE-2 detected a long, bright
and soft event at the extreme edge of the WXM field of view.

Ground analysis yields an error box centered at (J2000):
(RA,DEC) (deg) = 233.444d  -15.235d (15h 33m 47s  -15d 14' 04")

with the following corners (J2000):
(RA,DEC) (deg) =   233.792   -15.396
(RA,DEC) (deg) =   233.081   -15.456
(RA,DEC) (deg) =   233.096   -15.072
(RA,DEC) (deg) =   233.806   -15.015

The error box area is 944 square arc minutes.

The time profile shows a rise time of ~10 seconds and a fall time
of >100s, with little obvious spectral evolution. Neither a power-law
nor a blackbody yields an acceptable spectral fit.

This event is unusual. It resembles an X-ray burst from a galactic binary,
yet its location at high galactic latitude, its long duration without the
expected spectral evolution from photospheric expansion, and the failure
of a blackbody spectral fit all argue against this interpretation.

On the other hand, it is unusually bright for an X-ray flash, and the
failure of a power law fit argues against this interpretation.

There is  a known x-ray source (1RXS J153521.7-150420) in the error box,
but this is not unlikely for a box this large.

A light-curve of the event is given at http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/GRB060331/

We urge further observations of this unusual event at all wavelengths.
