B. E. Cobb (GWU), reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we obtained
optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 160425A (GCN 19343,
Krimm et al.) at two epochs. For each epoch, total summed exposure times
amounted to 15 minutes in I and V and 12 minutes in J and K.

No source is detected at the position of the optical
afterglow (e.g. GCN 19343, Krimm et al.; GCN 19344, Lipunov
et al.; GCN 19349, Bodensteiner et al.) to the approximate limiting
magnitudes listed below. The first epoch was obtained under particularly
poor seeing conditions.

Magnitudes are calibrated using USNO-B1.0 stars in I, and
2MASS stars in J and K.
