At 05:59:41 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB051111  
(trigger=163438).
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec=348.157,+18.367
{23h 12m 38s,+18d 22' 03"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys). The BAT light curve showed a
broad single peak with a 10 second rise to a peak of 4000 counts/s
(15-350 keV) around T+0 with decaying emission at least to T+20.
The spacecraft did not automatically slew due to Moon constraint.

A ToO observation is being planned.
