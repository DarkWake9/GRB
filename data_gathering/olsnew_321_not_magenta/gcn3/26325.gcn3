The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:57:19 UT on 3 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191203A (trigger 597049044.076016 / 191203290).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 332.4, Dec = 51.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 09m, 51d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 34.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 15.0 degrees.
