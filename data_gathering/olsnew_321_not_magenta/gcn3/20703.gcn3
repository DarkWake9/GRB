The short/hard GRB 170219A (IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al.,
GCN 20702) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=186.125 s UT (00:03:06.125).

The light curve shows a single, bright pulse with a
duration of ~0.25s. The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(1.6 ± 0.6)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0, of (2.8 ± 0.9)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum, measured from T0 to T0+0.064 s,
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff (CPL) model
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.24 (-0.15,+0.17), Ep = 1620 (-660,+1920) keV,
Cstat=47/56 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
