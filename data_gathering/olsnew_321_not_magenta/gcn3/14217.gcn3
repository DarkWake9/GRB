(YNAO) report on behalf of 2.4m telescope group:

We observed the field of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 14204) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope. Observations
started at 11:59:03 UT on 2013-02-15 (i.e., 10.46 hrs after the burst) and 5x300s R-band images were obtained. The optical afterglow of this burst was clearly detected in each image. The mag is R~19.2 calibrated with USNO B1 stars. 
   
We thank the GMG staff, especially Wen-Bo Xu, De-Qing Wang for
performing these observations.
