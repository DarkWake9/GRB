TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4804
SUBJECT: GRB060218: Optical Spectroscopy of GRB-SN

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech), E. Berger (Carnegie), and B. P. Schmidt (ANU)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We obtained an optical spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 060218 (GCN 4775)
with GMOS on the Gemini-south telescope starting on 2006 Feb 21.024 UT,
for a total of 1800 sec.  We confirm the presence of narrow emission lines
at z=0.033 (GCNs 4792,4803), as well as the presence of broad absorption
features similar to those seen in SN1998bw and other broad-lined 
Type Ibc supernovae (GCN 4803).

A plot of our spectrum is available at:

Further observations are planned."
