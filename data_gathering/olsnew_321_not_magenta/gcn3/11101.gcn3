S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL) and
C. J. Saxton (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:48:41 UT (15-Aug-2010), Swift-BAT triggered (#431756) on a spurious
source on the sky while the star tracker had lost lock. 
As such, the source in the image domain did not match anything
in the on-board catalog.  This is not a gamma-ray burst. 

[GCN OPS NOTE(15aug10): Per author's request, the "15-Mar-2010"
was changed to "15-Aug-2010".  We thank E.Winter bringing
this mistake to our attention.]
