We have imaged the field of GRB071020A (Barthelymy et al 
GCN6949) using the TNT 0.8 telescope at Xinglong observatory.
A series of R-band images were obtained from 17:08:19.4, 
10.1 hours after the burst. 

In our 15*600s combined image,  we detected afterglow 
(Schaefer et al GCN6947, Beardmore et al GCN 6955), 
The estimated brightness derived from USNO-B1.0 was 
R=21.14 +/- 0.08 at 11.5 hours after the burst
(mean time of the stacked image).

Further observations are encouraging.
