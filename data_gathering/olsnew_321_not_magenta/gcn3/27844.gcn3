The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:56:39 UT on 29 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200529A (trigger 612406604.278114 / 200529039).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 239.2, Dec = -18.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 56m, -18d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
