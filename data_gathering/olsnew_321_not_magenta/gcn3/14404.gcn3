report:

We re-observed the field of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale, et al., GCN 14377)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 20.14 to 2013/04 20.26 UTC
(32.30 to 35.30 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.13
hours exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.89 hours exposure in the Z, Y,
J, and H bands.

Relative to our observations last night (GCN 14388), the GRB afterglow has
faded significantly, by approximately 3 magnitudes in all bands.  In
comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we find:

  r'    21.74 +/- 0.12
  i'    21.80 +/- 0.16
  Z     21.52 +/- 0.26
  Y     21.01 +/- 0.21
  J     20.65 +/- 0.17
  H     20.98 +/- 0.35

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Uncertainties are 1-sigma.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
