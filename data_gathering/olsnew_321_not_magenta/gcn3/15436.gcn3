We again observed the field of GRB 131030A (Troja, et al., GCN 15402) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/11 1.08 to 2013/11 1.20 UTC (29.01 to
31.91 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.13 hours exposure
in the r and i bands and 0.88 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We continue to detect the uncatalogued source reported by UVOT (Troja et
al., GCN Circ. 15414), at fainter magnitudes than the first epoch of RATIR
observations (Littlejohns et al., GCN Circ. 15420). In comparison with the
SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

  r     20.73 +/- 0.03
  i     20.45 +/- 0.03
  Z     20.19 +/- 0.05
  Y     20.06 +/- 0.07
  J     20.07 +/- 0.08
  H     19.57 +/- 0.11

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. In comparison with the first epoch
of
RATIR observations these magnitudes can be modelled with power-law
decays, with indices of approximately t^-1.1 for the r and i bands, t^-1.0
for
the Z, Y and J bands and t^-0.8 for the H band.
