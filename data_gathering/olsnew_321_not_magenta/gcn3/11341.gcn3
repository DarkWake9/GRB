Dave Tierney (UCD) and Adam Goldstein (UAH) 
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 04:11:52.62 UT on 14 October 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101014A (trigger 308722314 / 101014175 ).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 26.94, DEC = -51.07 (J2000 degrees, 
equivalent to 01 h 47 m, -51 d 04 '), with an uncertainty 
of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54 degrees.
This burst resulted in a Fermi spacecraft repointing maneuver.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple pulses
with a T90 of about 450 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+1.5 s to T0+473.6 s is 
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 181.40 (+5.66/-5.44) keV, 
alpha = -1.27 (+0.01/-0.01), and beta = -2.07 (+0.02/-0.02)
(C-stat of 2499.1 for 591 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(2.072 +/- 0.009)E-04 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+208.77 s in the 8-1000 keV band 
is 58.96 +/- 0.42 ph/s/cm^2.



The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
