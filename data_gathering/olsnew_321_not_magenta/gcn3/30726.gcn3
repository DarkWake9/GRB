The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:10:16 UT on 27 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210827B (trigger 651751821.143562 / 210827424).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 308.8, Dec = -19.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 35m, -19d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
