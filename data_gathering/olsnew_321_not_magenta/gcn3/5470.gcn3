(IfA,UH) report:

Starting at August, 22nd at 06:05:49 UT, we obtained 2x900 sec spectra 
of the
candidate host galaxy of GRB 060801 (extended source B in GCN5389) using
Gemini North observatory and GMOS spectrograph with 1 arcsec slit and 
R400 grating.
 
We detect a bright emission line at 7942A, with no other apparent
features.  Identifying this line as [OII] at 3727A yields a redshift of
z = 1.131 for this galaxy. At this redshift, the observed fluence of 
8.1e-8 erg/cm2
(GCN 5381) corresponds to an isotropic-equivalent energy of 2.7e50 erg.

We thank the staff at Gemini for performing the observations.
