U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160824A detected by SWIFT(trigger 709765)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy. Member of: 
AAVSO - American Association of Variable Star Observers.
ISSP - Italian Supernovae Search Project.

The observations started 20.77 min after the GRB trigger,  
with our Schmidt telescope D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions not good for Moon proximity.

We co-added 4 series of 20 exposures of 120 sec each.
