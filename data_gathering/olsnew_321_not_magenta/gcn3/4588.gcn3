GRB 060124 : Optical observation at Xinglong and Kiso 

"We started R and I band imaging observation of GRB 060124 field at
16:21 (UT) using 0.8-m telescope at Xinglong observatory, China.  The
OT reported by (Kann # 4577) was detected clearly at RA = 05:08:25.9
Dec +69:44:27.

   The I band image is available at

     http://cosmic.riken.jp/grb/eafon/GRB060124_Xinglong_Iband.jpg

   Based on our preliminary R and I band photometry for Xinglong data,
the OT light curve do not show clear decay in our observational phase.

   We have also checked R-band data obtained under bad seeing
condition at Kiso observatory (Tomita et al. #4575). Due to
contamination from nearby bright star (USNOB: 1597.0077413), it is
hard to identify the OT by visual inspection. However, we also found
the OT in Kiso R band images."
