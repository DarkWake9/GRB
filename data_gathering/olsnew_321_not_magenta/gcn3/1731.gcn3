D.W. Fox and P.A. Price (Caltech) report:

We have observed the error circle of HETE trigger #2493 with the Palomar
48-inch + NEAT unfiltered CCD camera.  We find a point source at
approximate J2000 coordinates: 

	8:08:59.883 6:43:37.88	

that is not present on the DPOSS F plate.  The source appears stationary,
and appears to be fading.

Further observations are planned.
