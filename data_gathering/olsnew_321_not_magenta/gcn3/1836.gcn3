NUMBER:  1836
SUBJECT: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    03/01/31 10:30:47 GMT
FROM:    INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>

J.Borkowski, D.Gotz, S.Mereghetti on behalf of the IBAS Localization
Team,
S.Deluit, R.Walter, the INTEGRAL Science Data Center and the INTEGRAL
Science Working team report the detection of GRB030131 at UTC 07:39 in
the
field of view of the IBIS telescope.

The burst lasted about 100 seconds.


The preliminary position is RA 13h 27m 8s and DEC +30deg 46m with an
uncertainty of 10' radius, due to the fact that most of the GRB occurred

during a satellite slew.
