Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220806A (trigger #1119268)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 32445).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 260.858, -26.021 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 23m 26.0s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 01' 15.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The BAT light curve showed a single peaked structure with a duration of about 6 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 4.78 +- 2.00 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.30 to T+6.66 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.81 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.76 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
