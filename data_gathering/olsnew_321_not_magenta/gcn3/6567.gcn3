the Swift team

Using 746 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT V-band
data, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the  
XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):  
RA, Dec =
323.79225, -24.81752 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  21 35 10.10
Dec (J2000): -24 49 03.1

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (90% confidence).
