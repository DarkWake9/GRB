M. Capalbi, M. Perri (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the first 3 orbits of XRT data for GRB 060717
(trigger #219646, Sakamoto et al., GCN 5326). A ~2.6ks PC mode
image reveals a faint (30 photons), fading X-ray source at the following
coordinates:

RA(J2000) =   11h 23m 21.74s
Dec(J2000) = +28d 57' 03.2"

with an estimated uncertainty of 5.3 arcseconds (90% containment).
This position lies 3 arcseconds from the XRT position given in GCN 5326
and 76.5 arcseconds from the center of the refined BAT error circle
(Markwardt et al., GCN 5330).

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
