V. Rumyantsev, V.Biryukov (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI)  report on behalf of 
larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  the Swift GRB 090912 (Ukwatta  et al., GCN 9905) 
with Zeiss-600 telescope of  SAI MSU Crimean branch in  R-filter on Sep.12 
between  (UT) 17:41:36 - 19:08:10.  Within XRT error circle (Beardmore et 
al., GCN  9906) we do not detect any source. However  in a stacked image we 
detect faint source at the coordinates RA(J2000)=  12 32 09.82 Dec(J2000)= 
+61 29 04.54 with uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec. It is 3.5" apart from XRT 
center of the circle of 1.8" radius. We suggest the detected source as 
afterglow candidate and urge  deep observation to confirm variable nature of 
the source.

The photometry of the source against nearby USNO-B1.0 star 1515-0196640 
RA(J2000)= 12:32:18.77 Dec(J2000)= +61:30:00.3 assuming R=19.06 is 
following:

T0+     Filter, Exposure, mag.,     err.

0.1086  R     4620     21.8 +/- 0.3
