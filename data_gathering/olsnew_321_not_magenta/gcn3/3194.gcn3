report:


Tautenburg started observing the field of GRB 050408 (Sakamoto et al.
2005, GCN 3189) at 19:01 UT on Apr 08. Observations were performed in
V, R, and I, even though the weather conditions were not good.

A first inspection of the R-band images obtained between 19:29 and 19:40
UT does not show a source in the Swift/XRT error circle, implying R>20
about 3 hrs after the burst.
