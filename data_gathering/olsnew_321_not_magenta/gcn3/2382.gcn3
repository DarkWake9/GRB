report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind
observed this GRB at 09966 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 15 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  6.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
1.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl
(2000) = 343.697, -21.207 degrees, whose radius is 77.209 +/-  0.012
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as Earth, Mars,
and Ulysses are practically aligned, it will not be possible to derive
a small error box for this event.
