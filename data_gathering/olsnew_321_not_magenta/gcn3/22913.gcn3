GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 180705A  (Stamatikos et al., GCN 22902) 
with Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory 
starting on July 05 (UT) 16:13:52. We obtained several images in 
R-filter.  Within enhanced XRT Swift-XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 
22906)  we do not detect any object.  Preliminary photometry of the 
field is following.
