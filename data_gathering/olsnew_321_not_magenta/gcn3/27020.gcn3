report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200208q at T0 = 2020-02-08
13:01:17.991 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, 100% of the S200208q 90% c.l. localization region
was accessible to the AGILE MCAL.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs)  are obtained for a 1 s integration time
at different celestial positions within the accessible S200208q localization
region, from a minimum of 1.4E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 6.6E-06
erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with
photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV,
sensitive in the energy range 0.4-100 MeV.
Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
