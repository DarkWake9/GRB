P. Gokuldass (Florida Institute of Technology), N. Orange (OrangeWave
Innovative Science, LLC), K. Noonan (UVI), R. Querrard (UVI), K. Smith
(UVI), D. Morris (UVI) report:

We observed the field of GRB220701A (Evans et al., GCN 32306) with the 0.5m
Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 07-01-2022 starting at 05:16:18.64 UT (T+24
min). We performed a series of exposures in the R filter with a total
exposure of 3300 s. The weather conditions were partly cloudy during the
hours of observation with an average airmass of 2.

We detect no new source within the enhanced XRT position error circle
(Evans et al., 32308), consistent with other non-detections (Zheng et al.
GCN 32307;  O'Connor  et al. GCN 32309; Oates  et al. GCN 32310; Hu et al.
GCN 32311; Strausbaugh et al. GCN 32313; Belkin et al. GCN 32317) and
report the following 5-sigma upper limit:


T_mid            ||Exposure     ||Filter      ||Limit

T+ 1.5 hrs      ||3300s         ||R          ||>19.8


The limit is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and is not
corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the commissioning
phase.
