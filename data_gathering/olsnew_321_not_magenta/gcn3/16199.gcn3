Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:19:41.41 UT on 01 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140501A (trigger 420607184 / 140501139).
This burst, tentatively classified as Unreliable Location by the FSW,
is in fact due to a gamma-ray burst.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 171.9, DEC = 24.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 11h 27m, 24d 36'),
with an uncertainty of 10.7 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 0.256 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-0.128 s to T0+0.064 s is well fit by a power law function with an
exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.57 +/- 0.35
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 502 +/- 222 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.4 +/- 0.4)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 in the 10-1000 keV band is 5.6 +/- 1.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
