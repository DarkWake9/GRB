K. Torii (RIKEN) reports:

 The entire SXC error region of GRB 030528 (HETE trigger 2724,
Sequence number 6) was observed by the automated system at
RIKEN. Observations with 0.20-m telescope (f/4.0, equipped with
unfiltered AP7p) and 0.25-m telescope (f/6.8, equipped with unfiltered
AP6E) started at 13:04:48 UT and 13:05:31 UT on 2003 May 28,
respectively.

 Preliminary inspection of the first frame from the 0.25-m telescope
(60-s integration) does not show an optical transient candidate
brighter than about 15.8 mag (USNO-A2.0 red magnitude). Further
analysis and observation are in progress.
