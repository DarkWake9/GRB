TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  378
SUBJECT: IPN localization of GRB990705

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

We have obtained a preliminary IPN annulus for GRB990705.  This
annulus is centered at RA=147.5135 deg., Decl.=-8.0335 deg. (J2000),
and has a radius of 76.3049 +/-  0.0128 deg. (3 sigma).  It intersects the
BeppoSAX NFI error circle (GCN 373) to form a 5.4 arcmin.^2 error
box whose corners are:

RA(2000)	Decl.(2000)
05h 09m 52.5s	-72o 09' 53"
05h 09m 39.2s	-72o 06' 29"
05h 10m 12.1s	-72o 09' 34"
05h 09m 57.9s	-72o 05' 55"

This error box excludes the three radio sources reported in GCN 376,
but includes the ESO NTT source reported in GCN 377.  A map may be found
at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990705/.  This annulus can be refined considerably.
