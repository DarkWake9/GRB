The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:39:00 UT on 22 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220522A (trigger 674879945.37741 / 220522110).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 32.6, Dec = 4.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 10m, 4d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 37.0 degrees.
