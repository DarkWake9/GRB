WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 140705A (Stamatikos et al.,
GCN 16520) starting at 09:34:02 UT, 74 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect any new source within the enhanced 
XRT error circle (Osborne et al. GCN 16521) in our individual images, 
nor in the coadded images of the first 5 or 10 clear band images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about 
19.2 calibrated to USNO B1.0.
