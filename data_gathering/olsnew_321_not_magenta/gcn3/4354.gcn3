S. Covino (INAF/OABr), S. Piranomonte (INAF/OAR), D. Malesani (SISSA), 
L.A Antonelli (INAF/OAR), W. Boschin and G. Mainella (INAF/TNG), report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the possible GRB 051215 (Holland et al, GCN 
4352), using the 3.6m telescope TNG equipped with the NICS instrument. 
Observations were carried out under moderate seeing conditions (~1.5"), 
and started 1.3 hr after the GRB trigger. The total exposure times was 
10 min in J (mean time: Dec 15.087 UT) and 10 min in Ks (mean time: Dec 
15.099 UT). The field of view encompasses about 80% of the BAT circle 
(3' error circle).

We looked in our J-band images for objects not present in the SDSS 
catalog provided by Cool et al. (GCN 4353). The following two objects 
are not present in the SDSS catalog and have a brightness comparable to 
objects listed in the catalog:

1: alpha = 10:52:36.211, delta = +38:37:47.55 (J2000);
2: alpha = 10:52:40.123, delta = +38:37:08.67 (J2000).

Of course, color effects may be responsible for the lack of counterparts 
in the SDSS.

Further observations are planned to look for variability.
