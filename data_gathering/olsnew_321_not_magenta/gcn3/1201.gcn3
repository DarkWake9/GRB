GRB 011212: optical observation at Oslo

O. Trondal, Oslo, Norway, and H. Yamaoka, Kyushu Univ., report on
behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

"The field of GRB 011212 (=H10001, GCN 1194, 1196) is observed by O.
Trondal with 0.25-m F/4.2 telescope and CCD on Dec. 12.813 - 12.924
UT, i.e. 0.64 - 0.75 days after the burst.  The image almost coveres
the joint HETE/RXTE_ASM error box except a small Decl. > +32o17'00"
region.  The limiting magnitude of the combined (25 times 5 minutes)
image is rmag about 18.5.  We detect no afterglow candidate in the
error box."
