NUMBER:  5088
SUBJECT: GRB 060507: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits
DATE:    06/05/07 17:12:56 GMT
FROM:    Frank Marshall at GSFC  <marshall@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov>

F. E. Marshall and L. M. Barbier (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf
of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began observing GRB 060507 (trigger #208870, Barbier et
al., GCN 5084) 46 minutes after the BAT trigger.
No optical afterglow is detected inside the error region of the
candidate XRT afterglow (Vetere et al. GCN 5085).
Typical upper limits for a 3.5 arc sec aperture are given below
for the initial UVOT exposures. T is the time since
the BAT trigger in seconds at the start of the exposure.
No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) = 0.16 mag.
