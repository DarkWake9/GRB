Subject: GRO J1744-28: Fermi GBM observation

Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:46:41.88 UT on 12 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered on a burst from the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28 (trigger 416288804 / 140312157),
which was also detected by Swift (Kennea et al. 2014, ATel #5845).
A second burst triggered GBM at 06:55:18.28 UT. Both triggers were
classified as unreliable sources by the FSW, but were indeed due to GRO J1744-28.

The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight for both triggers is 58 degrees.

The GBM light curve of both triggers show a single pulse with a duration
of about 10 s (8-300 keV). For the first trigger, the time-averaged
spectrum from T0-3.712 s to T0+6.528 s is adequately fit by a simple power law
function with index -5.3 +/- 0.1. For the second trigger, the time-averaged
spectrum from T0-6.432 s to T0+5.856 s is adequately fit by a blackbody with
kT 4.04 +/- 0.08 keV.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary."
