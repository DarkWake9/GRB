The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of 
GRB050603 on June 3, 2005 at 15:42:59 UT, ~9 hours after the initial Swift 
BAT trigger (Retter et al, GCN 3509).  The observations were delayed 
because automated slewing was not enabled during engineering tests at the 
time of the burst. A fading source is detected in the V band at the 
afterglow position first reported by Berger & McWilliam (GCN 3511). The 
coordinates of this source are

Ra, Dec = 02:39:56.839, -25:10:54.92

Astrometry was performed using reference stars from the GSC.

Magnitudes from the two long exposures are as follows:

Filter	Magnitude 	Duration(s)	T_start(s)
V	18.2 +/- 0.12	1298		32997
V	21.8 +/- 0.4	2103		38782
