Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080330 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 308041) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 20.4s after the GRB trigger
(4.5s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
from 26 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detect a new raising source in the error box given by SWIFT
We detected the candidate couterpart in the XRT location
at the following position (+/- 1 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 11h 17m 04s47
DEC(J2000.0) +30d 37' 26"90

OT was R~16.8 at 300s after GRB.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=197.8461 lat=+69.1207
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.0 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
