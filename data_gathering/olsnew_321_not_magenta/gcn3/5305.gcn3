L. Vetere (ADSC), M.L.Conciatore (ASDC), J. R. Cummings (NASA/ORAU)
report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

XRT started observing the field of GRB060712 193 s after BAT trigger
in PC mode. The 2.2 ks analysis of the first two orbits provides the
refined XRT position:

RA(J2000)  =  12h 16m 16.3s,
Dec(J2000) = +35d 32m 17.8s

with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcsec (90% containment). This position is
0.1 arcsec away from the XRT position quoted in Cummings et al.
(GCN5301) and 8.2" arcseconds from the refined BAT position (GCN5304).

The light curve shows a fast initial decay.
Further osbervations are ongoing.
