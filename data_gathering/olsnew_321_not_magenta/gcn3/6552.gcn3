M. Yoshida, K. Yanagisawa, Y. Shimizu, S. Nagayama (OAO, NAOJ)
and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We performed optical imaging observation (g', Rc, and Ic) of the
field of GRB 070616 (Starling et al. GCN 6542) with 50cm MITSuME
telescope at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory from UT 18:04:40
(1h 35m after burst) to UT 18:10:30 on June 16 2007.

We coadded 5 CCD frames for each band. Exposure time of each
frame is 1 minute. We made flux calibration using USNO B1.0
catalg. We could not identify new source at the position of the
afterglow candidate reported by Fatkhullin et al. (GCN 6547) and
Ugarte Postigo (GCN 6548). Three sigma limiting magnitudes of
our observation are listed below.
