Analysis of AstroSat LAXPC data showed the detection of a long
GRB 210116. The light curve showed a peak profile triggered at
T0 = 05h 53m 33s UT on 16 Jan 2021. The light curve showed a peak
profile with T90 = 9 sec. The measured peak count rate above the
background associated with the burst is 867 +/- 37 cts/s in
LAXPC10 and 773 +/- 31 cts/s in LAXPC20 at T0+4 sec. The total
counts in the peak are 3219 +/- 85 cts in LAXPC10 and 2683 +/- 68
in LAXPC 20.

Both LAXPC instruments (LAXPC10 and LAXPC20) have registered this
burst profile in the light curve. For LAXPC20 the nominal energy
range is 3-100 keV, but due to lower gain in LAXPC10 the energy
range is about 30-400 keV.

The background subtracted light curve with 1 sec time-bin is
available at the web-site:

LAXPC was built by TIFR in collaboration with the Indian Space
Research Organisation. The Indian Space Research Organisation
funded, managed and facilitated the project.
