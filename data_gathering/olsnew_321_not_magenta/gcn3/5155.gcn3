S. B. Cenko (Caltech), E. Berger (Carnegie), S. G. Djorgovski, A. A.
Mahabal (Caltech), and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have observed the location of the afterglow of GRB060522 (Fox et al.,
GCN 5150; D'Avanzo et al., GCN 5151) with the Low-Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer mounted on the 10-m Keck I telescope.  We obtained an 1800
s spectrum shortly before morning twilight at a mean epoch of May 22.65
UT (~ 12.5 hr after the burst).

We find a prominent absorption feature centered around ~ 7425 A, with a
strong depression in flux blue-ward of this break.  Identifying this as
the Lyman-alpha break and fitting a DLA profile to the spectrum, we find
z = 5.11 +/- 0.01 and log(nH) = 20.5 +/- 0.5.

At this redshift and using a 15-150 keV fluence of 1.1e-6 (Krimm et al.,
GCN 5153), we find the prompt emission isotropic energy release from
GRB060522 is 5.1e52 ergs.
