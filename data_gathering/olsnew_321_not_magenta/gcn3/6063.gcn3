FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 070125 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at January 30 16.78 UT to January 31
4.76 UT, i.e. 5.39 - 5.89 days after the burst (GCN 6024).
We detect a radio source with a flux of 102 +/- 26 microJy at the position
of the optical counterpart (GCN 6034).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
