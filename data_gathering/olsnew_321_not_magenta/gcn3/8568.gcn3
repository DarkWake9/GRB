We observed the field of GRB 081126 detected by Swift (trigger #335647)
with the 14-inch Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT) located at the 
Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory 
(http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).  

Five set of 30s and 60s exposures were taken in the R filter starting 
from Nov. 27 03:58:18 (UT).  We do not detect any OT at the XRT 
position (Osborne et al. 2008 GCNC 8556).  The estimated 3-sigma 
upper limit of the combined image is ~17.5 mag using the USNO-B (r) catalog.
