R. Sanchez-Ramirez, S. R. Oates, J. C. Tello (IAA-CSIC Granada), S. Geier
(GRANTECAN), P. Tristam (Mt. John Univ. Observatory) and A. J.
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC and ISA-UMA) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160121A (Hagen  et al. GCN 18912) with the
10.4m GTC telescope (+OSIRIS) at La Palma. 6x900s spectra were taken at
the position of the optical afterglow, detected by the 1.8m MOA (Oates et
al. GCNC 18917), starting at 22:30 UT (i.e. 8.7 h post-burst). We identify
Mg II and several Fe-II absorption lines at z = 1.960 which we propose to
be the host galaxy redshift. An intervening system at z = 1.645 is also
detected.
