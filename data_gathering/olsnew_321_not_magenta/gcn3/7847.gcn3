D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:07:27 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080607 (trigger=313417).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 194.967, +15.900 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 59m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 54' 01"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peak
structure with a duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~35000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 06:08:49.1 UT, 82.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 194.9462, +15.9208 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 12h 59m 47.0s
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 55' 14.8"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 103 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the
column density using X-ray spectroscopy. 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 92 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate
afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	12:59:47.21 = 194.9467
  DEC(J2000) = +15:55:10.9  =  15.9197
with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5 arc sec. This position is 4.9 arc sec. 
from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is 19.7 with a
1-sigma error of about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02. 




Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vanessa AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
