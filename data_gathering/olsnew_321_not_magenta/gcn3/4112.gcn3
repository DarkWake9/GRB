K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the soft GRB 051016b (Parsons et al. GCN 4103)
was observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope. VRcIc
imaging started at 2005 October 16, 18:29:54 UT (105s after the
trigger) and 60s integration was repeated.

 The optical afterglow candidate (Chen et al. GCN 4105) is not
detected in our frames and the following limiting magnitudes for
single and stacked frames are derived.

------------------------------------------

18:30:58 Ic	15.2I	1
