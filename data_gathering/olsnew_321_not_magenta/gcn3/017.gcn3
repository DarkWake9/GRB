and Jonathan Davies (Cardiff, UK) report:
"Visual comparison of optical R-band observations made on December 
28.237 UT (1800s) and December 29.108 UT (900s) with the 2.5m Isaac 
Newton Telescope at La Palma of the inner 12'x12' region of the 
SAX WFC errorbox of GRB971227 shows no obvious varying object. 
Preliminary photometry shows that this corresponds to an upper limit 
on variability of 0.3 mags down to a limiting magnitude of R=22.8"
