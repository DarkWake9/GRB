Using the data set from T-239 to T+841 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120213A (trigger #514767)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 12942).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 300.987, 65.413 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 03m 56.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +65d 24' 48.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse starting
at ~T-7 sec, peaking at ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+75 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
48.9 +- 12.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.31 to T+74.46 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.37 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+5.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
