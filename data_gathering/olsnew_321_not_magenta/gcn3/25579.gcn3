Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190829A (trigger #922968)
(Dichiara, et al., GCN Circ. 25552).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 44.542, -8.958 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 58m 10.0s 
  Dec(J2000) = -08d 57' 28.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 5%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows an early peak centered at T-50 sec, coincident 
with the Fermi/GBM trigger (Lesage, et al., GCN Circ. 25575).  This early peak 
shows more counts in the higher energy bands (> 50 keV) than is typical for a precursor.  
This was followed by the main peak of emission from T-5 to T+10 sec, peaking at the 
trigger time.  Finally, there was a weak, hard peak between T+15 and T+20 sec.  
T90 (15-350 keV) is 58.2 +- 8.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-51.9 to T+7.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.56 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.4 +- 0.7 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 18.0 +- 2.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
