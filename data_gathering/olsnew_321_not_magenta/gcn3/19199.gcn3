A. Volnova (IKI),  E. Chornaya  (UAFO),  E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Matkin 
(UAFO, ISON),  I. Molotov (KIAM),   A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf 
of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

After receiving full data set of our observations (GCN 19184) we refine 
photometry and correct UT time of the observations.

The field of the GRB 160314A (D'Elia et al., GCN  19182) was observed 
with SANTEL-650 (0.65m)  telescope of UAFO/ISON-Ussuriysk observatory 
starting on March, 14 (UT) 11:56:51 under clear sky but with a high 
ground wind speed. We obtained series of unfiltered images of 30 s 
exposure. In a combined image we do not detect optical afterglow 
(D'Elia et al., GCN 19182; Siegel & D'Elia, GCN 19187; Malesani et al., 
GCN 19191). Photometry of combined images  is following

Date       UT start  t-T0   Filter  Exp.    OT     U_limit (3sigma)
                      (mid, days)    (s)

2016-03-14 11:56:51  0.01728  none    3*30  n/d    18.7
2016-03-14 11:56:51  0.04575  none   30*30  n/d    20.1

The photometry is based on nearby  SDSS star J073110.29+170129.9
assuming R_Lupton = 16.132.
