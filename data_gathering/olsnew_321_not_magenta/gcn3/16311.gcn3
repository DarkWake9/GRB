Swift Team:

At 17:34:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140521A (trigger=599546).  Swift did not slew to the burst
due to an observing constraint.   The BAT on-board calculated location 
is RA, Dec 320.013, +67.602 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 21h 20m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = +67d 36' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 12 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not 
slew until 00:39UT on May 22. There will be no XRT or UVOT 
data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (eleonora.troja AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
