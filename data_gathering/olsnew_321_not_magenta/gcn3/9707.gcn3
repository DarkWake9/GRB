SUBJECT: GRB 090726: Swift-XRT position of probable counterpart

FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <kpa@star.le.ac.uk>

K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Following a delay caused by an Earth-limb constraint, the Swift-XRT 
started observing GRB 090726 about 49 minutes after the trigger, at 
23:36:32 UT. The XRT initially centroided on a cosmic ray; however, using 
promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued X-ray source with an 
enhanced position: RA, Dec = 248.6788, 72.8843 (degrees) which is 
equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) = 16 34 42.90
DEC (J2000.0) = +72 53 03.3

with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This location 
is 156.1 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, inside the BAT error 
circle.

It is not possible to determine whether the source is fading at this time.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
