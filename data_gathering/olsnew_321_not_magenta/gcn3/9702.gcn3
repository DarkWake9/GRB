A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"The six Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers 269935914, 
269946189, 269952212, 269957694 and 269963785 observed at 06:11:52.75 UT,

22 July 2009  and trigger 270021937 observed at 06:05:35.05 UT on 23 July
2009, in some cases tentatively classified as a GRB, are  not due to a GRBs.

These triggers are all due to local particles events which occurred near
the SAA boundary."
