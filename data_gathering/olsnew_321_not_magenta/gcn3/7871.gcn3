NUMBER:  7871
SUBJECT: GRB 080613 : a long GRB detected with INTEGRAL

D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), A.Paizis, S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano),
V.Beckmann, M. Beck, R. Galis (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski  
(CAMK, Torun) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at
09:35:21 UT of June 13 2008. The coordinates (J2000)  are:

  RA:  213.2742 [degrees]
  DEC: +5.1687 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis yields a peak flux integrated over 1 s of about
1.3 ph/cmsq/s (20-200 keV) and a fluence over the same energy
range of about  1.3e-6 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
