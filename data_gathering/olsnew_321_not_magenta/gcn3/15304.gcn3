We observed the field of GRB 131004A (Hagen et al., GCN 15303) using the 
NOT equipped with AlFOSC. Consistent with the XRT position, we detect a 
new source at coordinates:

RA = 19:44:27.08
Dec = -02:57:30.2

The source is not visible in the DSS, and brighter than its limiting 
magnitude, hence it is very likely the afterglow of GRB 131004A. At a 
time of 0.43 hr after the GRB, we measure R = 20.2 +- 0.1 mag compared 
to nearby USNO-B1 R2 magnitudes, where the error is mostly due to 
calibration.
