GRB 170206A: Fermi-LAT detection

F. Fana Dirirsa (U. Johannesburg ), D.Tak (UMD/NASA-GSFC), G. Vianello (Stanford Univ.), J. Racusin (NASA/GSFC), D. Kocevski (NASA/MSFC)  report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 10:51:57.70 on February, 06, 2017 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 170206A which was also detected by Fermi-GBM starting at 10:51:57.70 UT (trigger 508071122 /170206453; Oliver J Roberts et al. GCN 20616).  

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 212.79,  14.48 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.85 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only). 

This was 67 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate that is spatially and temporally correlated with the trigger with high significance. 

The highest-energy photon is a 811 MeV event which is observed 5.17 seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Feraol Fana Dirirsa (fdirirsa@uj.ac.za <mailto:fdirirsa@uj.ac.za> ).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
