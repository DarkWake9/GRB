K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the NEAR and KONUS Wind GRB teams, E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team, and F. Frontera, E. Montanari,
and C. Guidorzi, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, NEAR, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed this
burst at 01853 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
~20 s, a 25-100 keV fluence ~2x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux
over 0.25 s ~8x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to
a preliminary 45 sq. arcmin. error box whose 3 sigma coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 14 h 47 m 14.72 s     41 o 13 '  14.81 "  (CENTER)
 14 h 47 m 26.87 s     41 o  5 '   1.45 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 46 m 53.86 s     41 o 17 '  31.63 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 47 m 35.54 s     41 o  8 '  58.02 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 47 m  2.53 s     41 o 21 '  28.85 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
