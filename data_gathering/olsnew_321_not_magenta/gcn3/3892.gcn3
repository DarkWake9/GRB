On August 10, 2005, at 07.7 UT we observed the field of GRB050724 with
Subaru+FOCAS and I filter.  The exposure time was 2 minutes. The seeing
was 0.4".  No object is detected at the position of the optical transient
reported by Berger et al. (submitted to Nature, astro-ph/0508115).  The
3-sigma upper limit is I = 23 (this is not corrected for the Galactic
reddening).
