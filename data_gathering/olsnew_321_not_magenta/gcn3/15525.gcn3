We observed the field of GRB 131127A (Markwardt, et al., GCN 15516) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/11 28.11 to 2013/11 28.26 UTC (16.42
to 19.94 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.49 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.04 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We do not detect any sources within the Enhanced Swift-XRT error circle
(Evans et al., GCN 15520), in comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the
following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 24.19
  i > 23.53
  Z > 22.78
  Y > 22.16
  J > 22.04
  H > 21.48

However, we do detect a red source just outside (3.3" away from the center)
of the XRT position, at a position RA, DEC = 332.731227 , 36.609171 (J2000,
+/- 0.5").  We measure:

  r = 24.21 +/- 0.35
  i = 22.48 +/- 0.11
  Z = 21.85 +/- 0.16
  Y = 21.22 +/- 0.15
  J = 21.03 +/- 0.14
  H = 20.88 +/- 0.20

The faint flux in r band relative to the redder bands could be due to IGM
attenuation at high redshift, z ~ 5.  We cannot confirm fading of this
source.  Further observations of this source are encouraged.

The magnitudes above are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction, E[B-V]~0.1, in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
