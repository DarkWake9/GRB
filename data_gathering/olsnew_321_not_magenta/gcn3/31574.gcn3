I. M. Carrasco-Garcia (UMA) and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The optical afterglow candidate reported in GCNC 31573 (Carrasco-Garcia et al.) is ruled out as it is detected in DDS-2 Infrared Survey and therefore is a highly reddened object unrelated to the GRB. We apologize for the inconveniences this may have caused. Further observations are still ongoing at San Pedro Martir reaching a limiting magnitude of 20.5.
