(INAF - TNG) report:

We observed the afterglow (Updike et al., GCN 6515; Cenko et al., GCN 
6525) of GRB 070612A (Grupe et al., GCN 6509) with the Italian 3.6m TNG 
telescope equipped with
the DOLORES camera on 2007 Jun 18.89 and 19.90 UT. Because of visibility 
constraints, images have been taken at high airmass (~ 3). The average 
seeing was of about 1.7". An extended object is clearly visible at the 
position of the optical afterglow (Cenko et al., GCN 6525) and its 
brightness remains constant at both epochs at a level of R ~ 21.4 
(calibrated against the USNO B1.0 catalog). This is consistent to what 
reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 6555) and suggests that the afterglow's 
brightness is now below the host galaxy level.

We acknowledge the support of the TNG staff.
