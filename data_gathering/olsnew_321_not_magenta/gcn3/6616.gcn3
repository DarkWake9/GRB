and Suzaku WAM team report:

The long burst, GRB 070704 (Swift/BAT trigger #283791; T. Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 6594;
A. Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 6602; S. Karpov et al., GCN Circ.6603) was triggered 
at T0=2007-07-04 20:05:02 UT by Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers the energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV.
The observed light curve shows the multiple peaked structures 
with a duration (T90 in the 50-5000 keV band) of nearly 35 seconds.
According to the GCN Report 69.2, the light curve observed by Swift BAT shows an upsurge
around T0+350, while in the light curve by Suzaku WAM, there is no such a structure.

The fluence in the 100-1000 keV band was (8.4+/-1.7)*10^-6 erg/cm^2,
and the 1-s peak flux in the same band was 0.19+/-0.06 photons/cm^2/s.
Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-5 to T0+40 is
well fitted by single power law with a photon index of 2.0+/-0.4 in 100-1000 keV range.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level, 
while systematic errors are not included.
