The automated robotic telescope 'pt5m' (Hardy et al.
2015, MNRAS 454, 4316) on La Palma observed the field
of GRB 151215A (Gibson et al., GCN 18691) starting
at 03:02:42 UT on Dec 15, 53 seconds after the alert
notice release and 74 seconds after the GRB detection.

Observations comprised of 59 x 60-second exposures in
the Johnson/Cousins R-band with approximately 6-seconds
dead time between images. The final image was taken 65
minutes after the first.

We detect the optical counterpart to the GRB and observe a
rapidly declining light curve. Photometry is performed using
historical instrumental zeropoints. We measure an initial
magnitude of R = 17.13 +/- 0.04 (2 minutes after the GRB) and
a final magnitude of R = 20.8 +/- 0.7 (67 minutes after the GRB).
