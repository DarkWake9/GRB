H. Swan (U Mich), C. Akerlof (U Mich), E. Rykoff (U Mich), S. Yost (U 
Mich) and I. Smith (Rice), report on behalf of the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS telescope, located at the Maui  
Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, observed the fading counterpart 
to GRB 060116 (Swift trigger 177533 (GCN 4519)). Images were taken 
between 08:45:11 UT (7.7 minutes after it was detected by Swift) and 
09:09:38 UT.  These are unfiltered optical images.  The diffraction 
grating normally mounted on the ABC was temporarily removed to 
accommodate observations of the final approach of the NASA Stardust 
mission.  After a comparison of our images with the USNO B 1.0 R2 
catalog, we see a fading optical transient centered within 0.06" of the 
OT reported by Kocevski (GCN 4528). A preliminary analysis gives an 
R-equivalent magnitude of approximately 20.0+/-0.1 at 08:45:29 UT. 
Further analysis is in progress.
