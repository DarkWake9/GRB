The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:11:36.16 UT on 31 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220831B (trigger 683644301 / 220831550).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 167.3, Dec = +1.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 09m, +01d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 63.0 degrees.
