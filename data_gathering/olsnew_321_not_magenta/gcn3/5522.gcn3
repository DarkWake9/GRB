K. Aoki, I. Tanaka (Subaru Telescope, NAOJ) and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech)
report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team:

"We began observing the field of GRB 060904A (Grupe et al., GCN 5502)
with MOIRCS on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope at ~6 UT (5 hours after the
burst). 

In the stacked image of the 18 x 120 sec exposure (mid time UT 6:24)
in Ks band, we detected an object with 20.2 mag in the XRT error
circle, though the object may be extended.  In the the J band image
of 21 x 120 sec exposure (mid time UT 7:13), we did not detect an
object brighter than 21.0 mag in the XRT error circle.  The magnitudes
were estimated based on the 2 MASS objects in the field."
