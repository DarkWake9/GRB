Using the data set from T-2.3 to T+7.7 sec, we report further analysis 
of BAT GRB 070406 (trigger #274153) (Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 6247).  
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 198.956, 16.530 deg 
which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 15m 49.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = 16d 31' 46" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 92%.
 
The lightcuve shows two peaks at T+0 and T+0.7 sec.  The burst was very
faint in BAT, and additional peaks may be hidden in the noise.  
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.7 +- 0.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+0.7 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 0.9 +- 0.4.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.5 +- 1.0 x 10^-08 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
