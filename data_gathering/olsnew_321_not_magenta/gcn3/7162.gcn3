V. D'Elia, L.A. Antonelli (INAF/OAR), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), E. Maiorano 
(INAF/IASF Bo), A. Magazzu' and N. Pinilla-Alonso (INAF/TNG), report on 
behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We took a 300s R-band image of NGC 2770 on 2008 Jan 11, starting at 
01:30:14 UT, with the DOLoRes camera on the TNG telescope located in the 
Canary Islands (Spain). An optical source, likely coincident with the 
object reported by Deng & Zhu (GCN 7160) and Thoene et al. (GCN 7161), 
is clearly detected at a position consistent with that reported for the 
X-ray transient (Berger & Soderberg, GCN 7159). The coordinates of the 
object are (J2000):

RA: 09:09:30.65
Dec: +33:08:20.3

with an estimated error of 0.3" (against USNO-B1.0).

We estimate the magnitude to be R~18.0 based on the USNO catalog (e.g. 
assuming R=17.2 for the star at 09:09:37.28, +33:09:35.1). A finding 
chart is posted at the following link:

Further analysis is underway.
