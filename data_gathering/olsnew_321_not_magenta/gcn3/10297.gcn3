report on behalf the Swift team:

Using the full data set from telemetry downlinks, we report
that Swift Trigger 381434 is due to a cosmic ray shower event
in the BAT instrument.  It is not due to a GRB nor any other
astrophysical source.  There were two showers ~8 msec apart
which caused the 64msec trigger to fire.

The XRT observed the field of the target starting 68 s after
the trigger. In the initial 7 ks in PC mode no source is
detected within the 3 arcmin BAT error circle down to a limiting
flux of 8 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Three X-ray sources are
detected with more than 3 sigma significance in the whole XRT 
field of view, the brightest one likely associated to 
1RXS J050001.1-550121, and the other two unidentified. 
All of these sources are further than 4 arcmin from the target position.

The UVOT began settled observations of the field of the target 
65 s after the BAT trigger. No new source is detected. 
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system 
(Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) for the first finding chart 
(FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

w2                 582         1551          117         >20.1

The values quoted above are not corrected for the Galactic extinction 
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of the burst 
(Schlegel et al. 1998).

The lack of a bright X-ray/optical counterpart of Trigger 381434 in 
prompt observations strengthens the spurious trigger interpretation.
