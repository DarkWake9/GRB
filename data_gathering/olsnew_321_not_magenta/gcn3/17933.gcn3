S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC/UCL-MSSL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of V404 Cyg
184 s after the BAT trigger (Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 17929).
A source consistent with the XRT position is detected in the initial
UVOT exposures. The white filter is approximately constant for
the first 600s after the trigger, but a slight increase in flux is observed
in white after this time until observations cease at ~900s. The increase
in flux is also observed in the v and b filters.

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the large Galactic
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 2.02 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
