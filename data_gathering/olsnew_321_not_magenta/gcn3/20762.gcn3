We observed the transient MASTER PSN reported in LVC GCN #20759, using LRIS
on the Keck I Telescope, on 2017-02-26 at 05:45 UT. The spectrum shows
relatively broad features at z=0.017. A SNID fit is consistent with a Type
Ic (possibly Ic broad-line) a month after maximum light. The host galaxy,
which does not have a previously known spectroscopic redshift, is also a
line emitter in the CLU (Census of the Local Universe; Cook et al. 2017)
narrow-band redshifted Halpha imaging, consistent with being local.
