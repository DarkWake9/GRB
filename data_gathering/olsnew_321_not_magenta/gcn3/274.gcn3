TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  274
SUBJECT: GRB990308 not a new SGR
DATE:    99/03/10 17:48:16 GMT
FROM:    David Palmer at USRA/GSFC  <David.M.Palmer.1@gsfc.nasa.gov>

David Palmer, on behalf of the Konus team, writes:

More complete data from Konus suggests that the spikes in GRB light curves
on 990307 and 990308 reported in GCN #271 are instrumental in origin.

In addition, the pulses were absent in data from other spacecraft, including Ulysses (K. Hurley, priv. comm.), RXTE (F. Marshall, priv. comm.) and BATSE (Woods et al.  GCN 273).

We therefore retract our suggestion that these observations are of a new
Soft Gamma Repeater.
