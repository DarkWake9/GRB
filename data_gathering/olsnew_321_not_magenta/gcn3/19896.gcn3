Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160905A (trigger #711084)
(D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 19887).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 162.249, -50.803 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  10h 48m 59.7s
    Dec(J2000) = -50d 48' 09.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 98%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a bright main episode with several
overlapping peaks starting at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+10 sec and ending
at ~T+25 sec.  The additional peak is seen starting at ~T+30 sec, peaking
at ~T+35 sec and ending at ~T+40 sec.  The further weak extended emission
is visible up to ~T+180 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 64 +- 16 sec (estimated
error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.2 to T+96.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.04 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.50 +- 0.02 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+8.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.3 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
