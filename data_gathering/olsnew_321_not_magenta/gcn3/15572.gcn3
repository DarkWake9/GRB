L. P. Singer (Caltech), M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie Observatories), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory (iPTF) collaboration:

The short-hard GRB 131126A triggered Fermi GBM (Fermi trigger
407130853) at 2013-11-26 03:54:10 and was localized by IPN using
Fermi and Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN 15550; Golenetskii
et al., GCN 15551).

Starting 2013-11-26 10:50:40, we imaged about 60 deg^2 surrounding
the trigger's localization using the Palomar 48-inch Oschin telescope
(P48), covering most of the GBM 1-sigma statistical+systematic error
region and most of its intersection with the IPN Fermi-Konus 3-sigma
annulus. Sifting through candidate variable sources using standard
iPTF vetting procedures, we find no afterglow candidates to an
average limiting magnitude of R~19.5 at 7 hours after the burst.

IPN localizations.
