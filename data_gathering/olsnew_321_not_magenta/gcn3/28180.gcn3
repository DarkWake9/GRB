Z.P. Zhu, D. Xu, X. Liu, S.Y. Fu (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 Senior High 
School), X. Zhang, J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200729A (Evans et al., GCN 28165) using the 
NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 
10x100s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 15:51:05 UT on 
2020-07-30, i.e., 20.22 hr after the burst.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the enhanced XRT 
position (Osborne et al., GCN 28168), down to a limiting magnitude of 
r~20.2, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
