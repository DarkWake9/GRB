A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed again
the field of GRB050408 (GCN 3189) on 2005 Apr 11.21 UT.
We still do not detect a radio source coincident with the
X-ray or optical afterglow positions (GCNs 3191 and 3192).
Coaddition with our previous observation (GCN 3210) yields a
flux of 74 +- 29 uJy at the optical position."
