D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT, La Palma), A. Pozanenko (IKI), and M. Ibrahimov
(MAO) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We have observed GRB060218/SN 2006aj (Cusumano et al. GCN 4775) with
Maidanak 1.5m  telescope in BVR on  Feb.27,  Mar.08, and  in BR bands with
NOT/StanCam on Mar.15. The following photometry is based on Modjaz, et. al.
(2006, astro-ph/0603377) calibration and the same reference stars in each
epochs:

Mid  time (UT),     B,          V,         R


Feb.27.63       18.08 (.01) 17.40 (.01) 17.21 (.01)
Mar.08.66       18.98 (.02) 17.83 (.02) 17.39 (.01)
Mar.15.86       19.66 (.03) -           17.84 (.02)

Only measurement errors are presented. The photometry is preliminary,
reduction and observations are continuing.  Our observations confirm a
maximum of the light curve (Modjaz, et. al. 2006, astro-ph/0603377)  between
Feb.27 and Mar.08. It is also evident gradual reddening of the SN.
