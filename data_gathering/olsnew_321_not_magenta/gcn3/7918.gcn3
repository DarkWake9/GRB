TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7918
SUBJECT: GRB 080701A, VATT optical upper limit
DATE:    08/07/01 22:43:48 GMT
FROM:    Peter Garnavich at U of Notre Dame  <pgarnavi@nd.edu>

C. Peters (Goshen College) and P. Garnavich (Notre Dame) report:

We observed the field of GRB 080701A with the Vatican Advanced Technology
Telescope (VATT) beginning July 1.46 (UT) or 45 minutes after
the bursts (Stroh et al. GCN 7910). Four exposures totaling 190 sec
in the R-band were obtained. The combined image was calibrated assuming
the
brightness of the USNO-B1 star at RA=3:03:21.50 DEC=75:28:15.48
is R=16.52.

No source is detected down to R=22.0 at the improved XRT
position (Evans et al. GCN 7914).
