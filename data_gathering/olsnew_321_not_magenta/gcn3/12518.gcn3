report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:35:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111103A (trigger=506902). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 327.122, -10.547 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 21h 48m 29s
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 32' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multiple-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 20:12 UT on 2011 November 05. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
