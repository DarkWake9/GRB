the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200213t at T0 = 2020-02-13
04:10:40.238 (UTC), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE mini calorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 96% of the S200213t 90 % c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are
obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions
within the accessible S200213t localization region, from a minimum of
1.6E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.5 E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as
spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive
in the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is
in progress.
