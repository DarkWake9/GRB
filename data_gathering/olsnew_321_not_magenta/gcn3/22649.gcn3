Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), M. Perri (ASDC) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 180418A at 07:35:27.5 UT,
3081.4 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 170.12059,
24.93276 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 11h 20m 28.94s
   Dec(J2000) = +24d 55' 57.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 88 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.07
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
