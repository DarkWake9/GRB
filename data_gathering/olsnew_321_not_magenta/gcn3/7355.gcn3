M. De Pasquale (MSSL/UCL) and J. K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC) report
on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of 080229B, detected by
SuperAgile (Evangelista et al. GCN CIRC 7340), starting 76.3 Ks
after the trigger. Exposures were taken in the v band.
No optical afterglow is detected at the position of the refined
XRT position (Moretti et al. GCN CIRC 7354) in the first 5
summed exposures.

  The following 3-sigma upper limit (in the UVOT photometric
system, Breeveld et al., GCN Circ. 6614) was determined at the
XRT position (RA=13:17:00.4 DEC= -64:51:44.6 J2000):

  We note that this field is very crowded and it suffers from a
high Galactic reddening E(B-V) = 1.9.
