GRB 160409A found in Swift BAT ground analysis

K. L. Page (U Leicester), and  D.M. Palmer (LANL)
report on behalf of the Swift Team

At 05:54:14 UT on 2016-04-09 BAT triggered and located
GRB 160409A (trigger #682162).  Swift did not immediately 
slew to this source because its location approximately
matched a known source (4U 1916-053) in its on-board catalog.  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, dec 289.705,-5.390 which is 
RA(J2000) = 19h 18m 49s
Dec(J2000) = -5d 23' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
peak structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger.

The catalogued source, 4U 1916-053, is identified by Simbad as being
the LXB V* V1405 Aql.  However, this object is 9 arcminutes from the 
BAT position, and well outside the error circle.  BAT has detected a burst
from that source (1.1 arcmin offset from the V1405 Aql location)
in April 2006.  During the 6-minute accumulation that overlaps the
trigger, SAX J2103.5+4545 is detected (at lower significance and 
correspondingly larger position uncertainty) with a 3.3 arcmin offset.
Therefore we can confidently state that this trigger did not come
from the location of V1405 Aql and is due to a different source.

A Swift Target of Opportunity was requested and XRT began
observing the field at 00:34:58 UT on 2016-04-12, which is
2.8 days after the BAT trigger. No unknown sources were 
detected in the 3 kiloseconds of data, although two known 
sources and possible scattered X-rays from V1405 Aql were seen.
No new sources were detected in UVOT down to a limiting
magnitude of 21.3 in white.

Qualitatively, about half of long GRBs would be visible in a 
3 ks XRT observation at that delay after the trigger, so the 
non-detection of an afterglow does not rule out a GRB.
