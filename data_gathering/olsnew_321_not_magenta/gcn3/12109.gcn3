behalf of the Swift Team:

At 07:48:43 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
trigger=456780.  Swift slewed immediately to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 22.861, +16.758 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 31m 27s
   Dec(J2000) = +16d 45' 29"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a rapidly rising 
background as the spacecraft entered the SAA.  In addition to the fact
that the image significance was less than the 7 sigma canonical threshold, 
this trigger is not a burst. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:49:44.2 UT, 60.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 

No prompt UVOT data products were received.  We are waiting for the
full dataset to search for a UVOT counterpart. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is W. H. Baumgartner (wayne AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
