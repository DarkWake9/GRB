report:

We observed the position of the Integral trigger 9073 (GRB 210312.87 or B)
with the D50 robotic telescope of the Astronomical Institute Ondrejov, near
Prague, Czech Republic. We performed a series of 10s and 20s unfiltered
exposures starting 23.8 s after the trigger.

In the first images we detect a rapidly fading object not present in the
DSS catalogue at 10:23:15.312 +76:52:06.96 J2000.  The preliminary
magnitude of the
object in the earliest images was R~18m.
