M. Perri, M. Capalbi (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the first 2 orbits of ground data from GRB 051008
(trigger #158855, Marshall et al., GCN 4069). We find a previously
uncatalogued, fading X-ray source within the BAT error circle at the
following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 13 31 29.3
Dec(J2000) = +42 05 59

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds (90% containment). This
position lies 35 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 4069.
