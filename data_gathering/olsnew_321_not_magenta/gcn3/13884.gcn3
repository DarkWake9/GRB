A. Volnova (SAI MSU, IKI), A. Matkin (UAFO, ISON), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. 
Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We report the light curve of the optical afterglow of the Swift GRB 121011A 
(Racusin et al., GCN 13845). The afterglow was observed with VT-50 (0.5-m) 
telescope of UAFO/ISON-Ussuriysk observatory starting on Oct. 11 (UT) 
11:21:29 (Volnova et al., GCN 13855). The light curve obtained from series 
of 30 s unfiltered imaging can be found at

The photometry is based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2).
