S. Kobayashi, D. Bersier, M.F. Bode (Liverpool JMU) report:


"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope immediately observed the field of
GRB060418 (Falcone et al. 4966) and started observing its position
about 5.0 minutes after the GRB.

The automatic "detection mode" procedure clearly detected the 
optical afterglow candidate at the XRT position reported by 
Falcone et al. (GCN 4966).

This source has a R magnitude of ~14.0 after ~6 minutes from 3x10-s 
images and clearly show a rapid early optical decay.

Further analysis and observation are still ongoing."
