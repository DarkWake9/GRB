J. Mao, Y. X. Xin, and J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:


We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station 
of Yunnan Observatory. We obtain the following results of optical counterpart:


Date begin UT r' begin UT i'
Nov. 21, 2014 17:00:04 20.45+/-0.04 17:41:21 19.90+/-0.03
Nov. 22, 2014 17:57:44 22.46+/-0.09 18:38:40 21.89+/-0.08
Nov. 25, 2014 17:16:11 21.32+/-0.05 17:36:44 20.99+/-0.04
Nov. 27, 2014 18:28:57 22.60+/-0.08 18:49:23 21.99+/-0.05


Due to the poor seeing, we could not distinguish between the afterglow and the possible host galaxy.


J. Mao apologizes for this very late GCN circular submission.
