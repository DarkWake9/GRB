report:

Starting at about UT 2004/07/09 12:45 (JD 2453196.0312) 
we obtained a series of J and H-band images covering 
2 x 2 arcmin with the ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring 
Observatory (E Long 149:03:39.8, S Lat 31:16:23.5). 
The images are centered on 20:53:53.0 -28:13:29 J2000 
(GRB040709, HETE trigger 11549 at UT 2004/07/09 00:58:07.96,
 JD 2453195.54037).

Comparison of our J, H images with the STScI DSS (B, R, and IR 
UKST plate scans from http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form ) 
reveals objects in the J, H images beyond the limit of the
DSS. We plan to obtain J, H images at a second epoch in order to
identify the GRB with a variable object declining in intensity.
