GRB 081222, localized by Swift (Grupe
et al. GCN 8691), was observed with 1.04m telescope at NainiTal
starting ~ 9 hours after the burst in R_c  and I_c
filters.
Photometry of the co-added R_c frames (300 sec x 6)
did not detect the optical afterglow candidate (Covino et al. GCN
8692) down to a limiting magnitude of ~ 21 mag in comparison to
nearby USNO stars.
