Ulysses and HETE-FREGATE  observed this GRB at 25133 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 20 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.6E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.7E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 342.016, -41.985 degrees, whose radius is 42.684 +/-  0.077
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
