Using the data set from T-240 to T+421 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061121 (trigger #239899)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 5823).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 147.228, -13.188 deg {9h 48m 54.8s, -13d 11' 16.6"} (J2000)
+- 0.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding
was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve starts with small smooth pulse at ~T-5 sec
and returning to instrumental background level at T+20 sec.  The the second
and much brighter started at ~T+50 sec with a series of overlapping peaks
the last of which was the brightest.  Then there was roughly exponential decay
out to ~T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 81 +- 5 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+121.8 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.41 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
 1.37 +- 0.02 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+74.48 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 21.1 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.

The isotropic equivalent energy using the reported redshift of 1.314 
(GCN Circ. 5826; Bloom, Perley & Chen) is 7e52 erg in 
the 35 keV -  347 keV band at the GRB rest frame.  

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
