We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the INTEGRAL XRF 050522
(Gotz et al., GCN 3446).  Analysis of 10077 seconds of Photon Counting mode 
data reveals a weak uncataloged X-ray source within the INTEGRAL error circle.
The probability that the source is a fluctuation of the background is about 
5.6E-5.

The source coordinates are:

RA(J2000) = 13 20 35.0
Dec(J2000) = +24 47 18

We estimate an uncertainty of 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This source is located 12 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position reported
in GCN 3446.  The count rate in the 0.3-10 keV band is  1.6E-03+/-0.5E-03.
We cannot yet determine whether this X-ray source is fading.

We confirm that the X-ray source outside the INTEGRAL error circle
reported previously on the basis of a preliminary analysis (Kennea et al.,
GCN 3452) is not fading and is no longer considered an afterglow candidate.

Further XRT observations are planned.
