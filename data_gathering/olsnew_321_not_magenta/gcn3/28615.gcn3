report:

The 25cm robotic telescope FRAM-ORM at La Palma (Spain) reacted robotically
to the alert of GRB201013A (Page et al GCNC 28607), obtaining a series of
20 s unfiltered images starting at 03:47:01.3 UT, i.e. 31.3s post trigger.

There is a relatively bright star (R~16.3) within the errorbox of the XRT
localization. With the relatively coarse resolution of the 25 cm telescope,
direct detection of a faint object within the XRT errorbox is impossible.

We performed aperture photometry of the star. There seems to be an excess
flux of ~3.5 sigma by ~ 570 s post trigger. This is when optical afterglows
often show maxima in their
lightcurves.

We also performed image subtraction of a sum of four images obtained at the
time of the detected peak and twelve latest images of the series. The
resulting frame contains a very
weak residual towards the position of the X-ray afterglow from the star
center.

We therefore conclude that there is a slight possibility of an afterglow
peaking at R~17.0, which was outshined by a nearby star of R~16.3.
