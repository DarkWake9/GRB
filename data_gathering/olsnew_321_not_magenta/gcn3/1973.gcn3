G. Masi (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and European Southern Observatory, 
Chile), B. L. Jensen, J. Hjorth (Copenhagen University) and R. Michelsen 
(Astronomical Observatory, Copenhagen) report: 


Further to GCN 1960, we performed additional photometry of the OT initially 
reported by Gilmore at al. (GCN 1949). The Danish 1.54m telescope (La Silla) 
+ DFOSC CCD camera were used to grab three, 360s R-band images; summing them 
we obtained the following Rc magnitudes (based on GCN 1948): 

Mar. 26, 00:54 UT   21.3 Rc
Mar. 27, 00:50 UT   21.6 Rc
Mar. 28, 03:45 UT   22.8 Rc 

(Errors around 0.2 mag)
