The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160703A (Cenko et al., GCN 19645) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. While the first observation on 2016 Jul 03.83 was severely 
affected by RFI, our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jul 04.99, Jul 
07.00, and Jul 11.00 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (D'Elia et al., GCN 19655), with 3sigma upper limits of 150 
uJy, 210 uJy, and 120 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
