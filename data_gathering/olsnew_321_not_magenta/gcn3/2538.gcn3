Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS) and Konus-Wind observed H3066 (GRB040228 at
00536 s, GCN 2536).  In addition, Konus-Wind observed H3067 (GRB040228
at 00764 s) and the 50 s long X-ray pulse which followed it (GCN
2536).  Neither of these was observed by Odyssey, but this is
consistent with the lower intensity of H3067, and the spectral softness
of the X-ray pulse (the Odyssey lower energy threshold is ~100 keV).
Ulysses was off.

We have triangulated H3066 to an annulus centered at RA, Decl (J2000) =
222.855, -17.387 degrees, whose radius is 31.387 +/- 0.055 degrees (3
sigma).  The minimum distance between this annulus and the position of
the X-ray pulse determined by the HETE WXM is ~37 degrees; in addition,
this position is Mars-blocked to Odyssey.  We therefore conclude that
H3066 and the X-ray pulse are unrelated.

Using Mars-blocking, the IPN annulus, and the Konus ecliptic latitude
determination, we can restrict the arrival direction of H3066 to that
portion of the annulus which lies between RA, Dec = 246, -42 degrees,
and 253, -33 degrees.  This area was far outside the HETE WXM FOV,
further proof that H3066 and the X-ray pulse detected by the WXM are
unrelated.

However, Konus-Wind data indicate that the arrival directions of H3066,
H3067, and the X-ray pulse are all consistent with an ecliptic latitude
of -10 to -20 degrees.  Thus H3067 may be related either to H3066 or to
the X-ray pulse (but not both). It may also be an independent event.

Finally, we note that the Odyssey data display a strong, 5 s long pulse
~350 s after the signal corresponding to H3066.  We are investigating
the possible relation of this pulse to the other bursts.
