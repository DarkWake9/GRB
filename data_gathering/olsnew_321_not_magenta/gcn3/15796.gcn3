report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:18:15.98 UT on 06 February 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140206A (trigger 413363898 / 140206304),
which was also detected by the Swift (Lien et al. 2014, GCN 15784)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 123 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 27 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.5 s to T0+14.3 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 120 +/- 6  keV,
alpha = 0.2 +/- 0.1, and beta = -2.4 +/-0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.47 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 17.4 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
