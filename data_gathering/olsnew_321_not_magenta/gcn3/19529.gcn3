Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160611A (trigger #690598)
(Malesani, et al., GCN Circ. 19522).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 164.417, -70.396 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  10h 57m 40.0s
    Dec(J2000) = -70d 23' 45.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 45%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single episode with several overlapping
pulses.  The emission starts at T-15 sec, peaks at T+3 sec and ends at T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 34.1 +- 5.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
A pre-planned spacecraft slew moved the source out of the field of view at
about T+165 sec.
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-31.38 to T+10.37 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.67 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.1 x 10^-6  erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.84 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
