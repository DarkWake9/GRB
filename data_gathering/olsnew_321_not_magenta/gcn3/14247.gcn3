A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

We have analysed 8 ks of XRT data for GRB 130216A (Melandri et al.,  
GCN Circ. 14223), from 317.7 ks to 347.4 ks after the BAT trigger. The  
data are all in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No X-ray afterglow is  
detected inside the refined BAT error circle (Sakamoto & Berthelmy,  
GCN Circ. 14240). The 3sigma upper limit is of 4.7 x 10^-3 cts/s.

This corresponds to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.8 x 10^-13 erg/ 
cm2/s (assuming a typical GRB spectrum with photon spectral index of  
2). If we consider the Galactic absorption in this direction (1.5 x  
10^21 cm^-2; Kalberla et al. 2005) this corresponds to an unabsorbed  
flux of 2.4 x 10^-13 erg/cm2/s.
