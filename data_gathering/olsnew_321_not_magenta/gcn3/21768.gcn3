L. Resmi (IIST),  K. Misra (ARIES),  N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), P. T. O’Brien (U. Leicester) and S. Schulze (Weizmann Institute of Science) report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the LIGO/Virgo G298048 source SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN Circ. 21529) with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 25 Aug 2017 10.5 UT at 1390 MHz for a total integration time of 2 hours.  
 
Preliminary analysis of the data does not reveal any emission at the location of the optical transient up to a 3-sigma upper limit of 130 micro Jy. 
 
We report a weak detection of ~ 160 micro Jy at

RA(2000) = 13:09:47.74
Dec(2000) = -23:23:01.24  with a positional uncertainty of 3".   
This is consistent with the position of the optical host galaxy and the JVLA/ALMA radio source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC GCN Circ 21589) and Williams et al (LVC GCN Circ 21750). 

Further analysis is underway. Continued follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the GMRT staff for prompt scheduling of these observations. The GMRT is run by the National Center for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
