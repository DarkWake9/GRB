A. Rowlinson (U. Leicester), K. Page (U. Leicester) and N. Lyons (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 100216A (Cummings et al. GCN
Circ. 10428), from 214.4 ks to 249.2 ks after the BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

We do not detect any fading source within the BAT refined error circle
of Cummings et al. (GCN Circ. 10428). A source is detected within the
BAT refined error circle at RA, Dec = 154.25836, +35.56772 which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 10h 17m 2.0s
Dec (J2000): +35d 34' 3.8''

with an uncertainty of 5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence) and is likely
to be the known X-ray source 1RXS J101702.9+353404. This source has a
count rate of 0.004 count s^-1, corresponding to a flux of 2.6e-13 erg
cm^-2 s^-1, however fading cannot be determined at this time and futher
observations are being planned.

The three sigma upper limit 0.3 - 10 keV count rate for a source at any
other position within the BAT error circle is 6e-4 count s^-1, which
corresponds to an observed flux limit of 2.3e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical count-to-observed flux conversion factor of 3.8e-11
erg cm^-2 ct^-1, Evans et al., 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
