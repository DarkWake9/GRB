TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 74964 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 0.06 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3E-7 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  7E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.03125 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 336.064, -27.164 degrees, whose radius is 38.543 +/-  0.020
degrees (3 sigma).

The Ulysses and INTEGRAL time histories are identical in duration, but
otherwise rather featureless.  Although the annulus does not pass
through any of the known SGRs, given the current activity of
SGR1806-20, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Ulysses response
is due to SGR1806-20, and occurs by chance within the +/-2900 s Ulysses
crossing window, while the INTEGRAL response is due to a short/hard
GRB.

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
