report on behalf of the SVOM Ground Follow-up Group:


We observed 4 sky regions to cover the initial skymap of the 
LIGO/Virgo trigger S190521g (GCN24621), with the SVOM/GWAC-F30 
telescope operated by Huaibei Normal University and NAOC, CAS 
at Xinglong Observatory, China. 
The SVOM/GWAC-F30 is equipped with Standard Johnson filters
and 3Kx3K FLI CCD (FOV~1.8x1.8 degree). The GWAC-F30 is using
tiling observation strategy. The tiles are calculated to cover
the most probable regions of the 90% localization area given in the
GW probability skymap. Several images with a single exposure of 60s
time in R band are taken for each tile.
The 4 tile coordinates and the observation periods are listed below:

The first image was taken ~10.8 hours after the event trigger time. The
weather conditions were partly cloudy during the night. 
No credible new source is detected by our online pipeline.
A more detailed image analysis is in progress with our offline pipeline
to search for any fainter transient candidate.
