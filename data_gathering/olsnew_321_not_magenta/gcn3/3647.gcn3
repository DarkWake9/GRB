on behalf of the Swift-BAT/-XRT teams:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=146731) at 13:58:52.85 UT on 19 July 2005
(reported in GCN 3645, S. Vaughan) is not due to a real GRB or any other
astrophysical source.  Further analysis using the full BAT data has shown
this to be 3 cosmic ray showers in the instrument within a 15 msec window.
In addition, XRT did not detect any point source inside the BAT error circle
in 2 orbits of data.
