On 16 December 2003 BART telescope observed the region reported by GCN as GRB 
2974. We have acquired 14 120 sec wide field images in I and R filter of the 
region before meteorological conditions worsened so we were unable to take 
further images. Limiting magnitude estimate is 13. The first image exposure 
started at 19:48:27 UT, 14 minutes 20 second after event.

During first quick analysis we did not find any transient like source. Further 
data analysis is planned.
