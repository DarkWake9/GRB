Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151114A (trigger #663490)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 18599).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 120.947, -61.033 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 03m 47.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -61d 01' 58.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 30%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-4 sec,
peaking at ~T0 sec, and ending at ~T+1 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
4.86 +- 0.98 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.26 to T+1.25 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.14 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
