S. Kobayashi, D. Bersier, M.F. Bode (Liverpool JMU) report:

"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope followed up the field of GRB060319 
(Ziaeepour et al., GCN 4885) and started observing its position 
about 7.0 minutes after the GRB. 

The automatic "detection mode" procedure did not reveal any obvious 
afterglow candidate at the preliminary XRT position reported by 
Kennea et al. (GCN 4886), brighter than about R~19 mag from 6x10-sec 
images, confirmed by visual inspection.

Limiting magnitude has been derived with reference to USNOB1.
Further analysis is still ongoing."
