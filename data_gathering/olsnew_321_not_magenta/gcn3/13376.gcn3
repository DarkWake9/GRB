and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The bright, short-duration GRB 120624A has been observed by Fermi (GBM
trigger 362215467), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, Swift (BAT), and
MESSENGER (GRNS), so far, at about 26665 s UT (07:24:25). The burst was
outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
     RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
    ---------------------------------------------
    Center:
       4.773 (00h 19m 05s)  +7.167 ( +7d 10' 00")
    Corners:
       5.349 (00h 21m 24s)  +5.841 ( +5d 50' 28")
       5.463 (00h 21m 51s)  +5.941 ( +5d 56' 27")
       4.182 (00h 16m 44s)  +8.484 ( +8d 29' 02")
       4.068 (00h 16m 16s)  +8.384 ( +8d 23' 01")
    ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 0.42 sq. deg, and its maximum dimension is 2.9 deg
(the minimum one is 0.2 deg).

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
