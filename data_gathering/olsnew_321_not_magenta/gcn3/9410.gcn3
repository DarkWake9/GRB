D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), C.C. Thoene (INAF/Brera), P. Jakobsson (Univ. 
Iceland), A.J. Levan (Univ. Warwick) J.P.U. Fynbo, B. Milvang-Jensen 
(DARK/NBI), report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We provide further analysis of the photometric data on the afterglow of 
GRB 090519 (Perri et al., GCN 9400) taken at the NOT and VLT (Thoene et 
al., GCN 9403; Levan et al., GCN 9409).

Calibration of the field based on archival VLT zeropoints yields a 
significantly fainter magnitude for the afterglow with respect to our 
previous GCN 9403, which was based on USNO stars. The new calibration is 
consistent with SDSS stars and with the value reported by Rossi et al. 
(GCN 9408). We find for the afterglow R = 22.8 on 2009 May 19.897 UT 
(0.33 hr after the GRB).

The decay of the afterglow is well described by a power law with index 
alpha = 0.44 +- 0.03 between 0.33 and 3.6 hr after the GRB.
