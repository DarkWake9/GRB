  Earlier, we reported the detection of the after glow of GRB080307
  (GCN Circular, #7364). Our reported afterglow at the UVOT position
  turned out to be a known star, and we retract our earlier report.
  We do not detect the GRB afterglow at the enhanced XRT position
  (GCN Circular #7366), and we place the limit of R > 21.2 at 3 sigma.
  Further analysis is ongoing.
