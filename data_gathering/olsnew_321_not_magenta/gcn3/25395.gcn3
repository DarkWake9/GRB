Report on behalf of the 1M2H and the UC-NASA-Keck collaborations:

We obtained near-IR spectroscopy of DG19njmjc (= AT 2019nra), a transient
spatially coincident with the localization of S190814bv (GCN #25324, GCN #25333),
being approximately on the 55th percentile confidence contour, with the 
Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I telescope
on Maunakea, starting at UT 2019-08-18 14:24:52, aproximately 3.7 days after
the LIGO/Virgo alert.

Our spectrum covers the J-band (1.15-1.35 microns). The spectrum has relatively
low S/N (S/N ~ 10), and appears featureless, with no obvious emission or 
absorption features.

We thank the staff of Keck observatory, especially Carlos Alvarez, Randy Campbell,
Jim Lyke, Alan Hatakeyama and John O'Meara, for facilitating this
Target of Opportunity observation.
