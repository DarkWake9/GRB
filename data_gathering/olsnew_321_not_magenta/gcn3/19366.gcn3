Z. Cano (Univ. Iceland), N. Tanvir (Univ. Leicester), D. Malesani
(DARK/NBI)  & J. Saario (NOT) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160501A (Cummings et al.; GCN Circ. 19365)
with the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with the StanCam and the
NOTCam, starting at 01:57 UT on 01 May 2016.  We obtained 15 minutes in the
I-band (StanCam) and 18 minutes in the H-band (NOTCam).  In our co-added
optical and NIR images we do not detect any new source within the XRT error
circle to the following limits:

I > 22.3 mag
H > 19.0 mag

These upper limits (Vega) are for a single point source in the GRB field,
they are calibrated against the USNO-B1 (optical) and 2MASS (NIR)
catalogues, and they have not been corrected for foreground extinction.
