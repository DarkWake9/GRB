A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and J. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT carried out further observations of the field of the Fermi GRB 161015A (Ohno et al., GCN Circ. 20054; Stanbro & Meegan, GCN 20056) between T0+371.3 ks and T0+395.9 ks. The total exposure time is 5.0 ks, entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

The source reported in D'Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. 20057) as an X-ray afterglow candidate is no longer detected. The 3sigma u.l. is about 3.4e-3 ct/sec (corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 1.7e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1, assuming a typical GRB spectrum). We thus confirm it as the X-ray afterglow associated with GRB 161015A.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
