After  HETE alert 3274 (Probable GRB, known X-ray sources)  MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had automatically imaging  the
corresponding area of the sky (58 seconds after trigger time).  We have 30
unfiltered images of the error box (30s exposition, 6 square degrees
field).
Under the bad weather condition the limiting magnitude was about 13.
There is no  OT at SGR1806-20 position.
