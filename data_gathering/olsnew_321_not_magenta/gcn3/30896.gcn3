The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:42:22 UT on 29 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210929B (trigger 654637347.41104 / 210929821).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 263.0, Dec = 2.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 32m, 2d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70.0 degrees.
