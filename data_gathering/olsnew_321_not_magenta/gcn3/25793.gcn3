Page (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the INTEGRAL-detected
burst GRB 190919B (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 25788), collecting 3.0
ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+28.6 ks and T0+36.4 ks.


An uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected 1.1 arcsec from the
reported GROND afterglow position (Bolmer, GCN Circ. 25789):

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  311.87783  =  20:47:30.68
  Dec (J2000.0): -44.69542  =  -44:41:43.5
  Error: 2.1 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: 0.0222 [+0.0032, -0.0031] ct s^-1   
  Distance: 0 arcsec from INTEGRAL position.
  Flux: (7.16 [+1.03, -0.98])e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)


The source is below the RASS limit and, due to the limited amount of
data available so far, shows no signs of fading.


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
