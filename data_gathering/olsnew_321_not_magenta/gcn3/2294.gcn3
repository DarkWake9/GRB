TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2294
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030709 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 38245 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 30 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.8E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 155.101,  28.225 degrees, whose radius is 64.127 +/-  0.030
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.

It is not known at this point whether this event was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
