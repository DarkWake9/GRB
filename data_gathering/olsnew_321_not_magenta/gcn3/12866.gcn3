Anna Pancoast (UCSB), Rebecca Rosen (Cal Poly), Vardha Bennert 
(Cal Poly), A. Cucchiara (UCO) and J. Xavier Prochaska (UCO) 
on behalf of GRAASP report:

"We observed the afterglow of GRB 120119 with the Kast
dual spectrometer for 1800s total starting at UT 05:30
under fine conditions.  Analysis of the red side exposure
shows strong absorption from ZnII and FeII transitions
at a common redshift of z=1.73 confirming the reported
redshift of Cucciara & Prochaska (GCN 12865).  

Further analysis is in progress.
