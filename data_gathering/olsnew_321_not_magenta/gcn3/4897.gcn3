TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4897
SUBJECT: GRB 060319: WHT K-band candidate afterglow
DATE:    06/03/19 16:23:49 GMT
FROM:    Nial Tanvir at IofA U.Cambridge  <nrt@ast.cam.ac.uk>

N.R. Tanvir (U. Hertfordshire), E. Rol (U. Leicester),
K. Wiersema, R. Starling (U. Amsterdam) and N. O'Mahoney (ING)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060319 with WHT/LIRIS.  A 10 min K-band
exposure was made beginning at Mar 19 06.38 UT (ie. approximately 5.4
hours post-burst).

A faint source is visible within the XRT error circle reported by
Beardmore et al. (GCN 4895).  The coordinates of the source are
(relative to DSS system) approximately:

   11 45 33.5  +60 00 39.0  (J2000)

The magnitude relative to two nearby 2MASS stars is K=19.0+-0.3.
It is not possible to tell whether the source is constant or variable.
