P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov, and D. Svinkin on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and Konus-RF teams, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long bright GRB 090406  triggered Konus-Wind
at T0=62531.417 s UT (17:22:11.417),
and Konus-RF instrument onboard CORONAS-PHOTON s/c
at T0=62535.495 s UT (17:22:15.495).

The burst light curve shows a smooth single-peaked structure
with a duration of ~12 s.

--
As observed by Konus-Wind the source of the burst
is in the south ecliptic hemisphere
at ecliptic latitude of -46.5 +/- 3 degrees.
The burst had a fluence of 6.6(-0.26, +0.17)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 0.256-ms peak flux measured from T0+1.536 s
of 2.1(-0.15, +0.14)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+15.616 s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range) by GRB (Band) model
for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.04 +/- 0.05,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.69(-0.29, +0.19),
the peak energy Ep = 241(-15, +16) keV (chi2 = 53.4/58 dof).

--
As observed by Konus-RF the burst
had a fluence of 7.3(-0.23, +0.11)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 0.300-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.600 s
of 2.2(-0.16, +0.14)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0-0.800 to T0+10.500 s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range) by GRB (Band) model
for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.86 +/- 0.03,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.54(-0.13, +0.10),
the peak energy Ep = 228(-10, +11) keV (chi2 = 153/133 dof).

--
Due to uncertainties in the burst incident angles
the quoted values are preliminary. All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
