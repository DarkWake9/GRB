D. A. Perley (LJMU), Anna Y. Q. Ho (Berkeley), Y. Yao (Caltech), and R. 
A. Perley (NRAO) report:

We obtained observations with the Very Large Array of ZTF21aaeyldq 
(AT2021any; Ho et al., GCN 29305) at a mean frequency of 10 GHz between 
04:50 and 05:50 UT on 2021-01-21, approximately 4.95 days after the ZTF 
discovery observation.

A source is clearly detected at a position consistent with that of the 
optical transient.  The flux density at this time is approximately 90 
microJy.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly scheduling and executing these 
observations.
