S. T. Holland (STScI) and
V. Mangano (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observations of the field of GRB 131231A 136.5 ks
after the Fermi/LAT trigger (Sonbas et al., 2013, GCNC 15640).  The
preliminary UVOT position is

     RA (J2000)  00:42:21.66  =  10.59025 (deg)
    Dec (J2000) -01:39:10.6   =  -1.65294 (deg)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.43 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence,
statistical + systematic).  We detect the optical afterglow at the
position reported by Xu et al. (2013, GCNC 15641).  Preliminary UVOT
photometry is presented below.

The quoted magnitudes and upper limits have not been corrected for the
Galactic extinction along the line of sight to this burst of E_{B-V} =
0.02 mag (Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJS, 737, 103).  The photometry is in
the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP
Conf. Proc. 1358, 373).

The white observations yield a power-law decay index of alpha ~ 1.25
between 1.6 and 2.7 days.  This is consistent with that found by
Perley et al. (2014, GCNC 15650) between 1.0 and 1.9 days.  The
power-law decay index in the X-ray band at this time is alpha ~ 1.6
(Mangano et al. 2014, 15648), suggesting that there may be a cooling
break between the optical and X-ray regimes.
