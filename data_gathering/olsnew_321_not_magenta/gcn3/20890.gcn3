Swift-IceCube collaboration:

Swift has observed the field of the IceCube HESE neutrino,
IceCube-170312A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/20857.gcn3), utilizing
the on-board
19-point tiling pattern to cover a region centered on RA,Dec (J2000) =
(304.7300, -26.2380), with a radius of approximately 0.8 degrees.

Swift-XRT collected ~800 s per field of PC mode data per tile. The
observations were taken between 15:51:22 on 2017-03-12 and 05:04:48 on
2017-03-13 (i.e. from 7.3 ks to 54.9 ks after the neutrino trigger),
and covered 2.1 square degrees.

Five X-ray sources are detected in the observations. One of these
corresponds to a known X-ray emitter, and others are faint objects
well below the RASS limits, therefore we do not consider any of them
to be likely counterparts to the IceCube trigger. We conclude that we
have not discovered a transient X-ray event associated with the
IceCube trigger.

The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate in the rest of the field is
0.01 ct s^-1, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.1e-13 erg
cm^-2 s^-1 for a typical AGN spectrum (NH=3e20cm^-2, Gamma=1.7).
Overlaps between the different tiles accounts for 0.5 square degrees:
in these regions the 3-sigma upper limit is .007 ct s^-1,
corresponding to 2.9e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Details of the five detected X-ray sources are below. All fluxes are
0.3-10 keV and assume the same AGN spectrum as above.
