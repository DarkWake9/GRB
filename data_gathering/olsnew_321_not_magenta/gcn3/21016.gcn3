report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:33:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170419B (trigger=748947).  Swift did not slew due to Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 60.498, -15.143, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 01m 59s
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 08' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single 
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:29 UT on 2017 June 19. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Cholden-Brown (aaronb AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
