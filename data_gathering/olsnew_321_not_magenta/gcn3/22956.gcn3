The short, hard GRB 180715A (Swift-BAT trigger #848048:
Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 22947, 22951; Fermi-GBM detection:
Hamburg and Meegan, GCN Circ. 22952) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 18:07:04.799 UTC on 15 July 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked pulse which starts
at T+0.192 sec and ends at T+0.784 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
0.53 +- 0.07 sec and 0.34 +- 0.12 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst (measured by the SGM from
T+0.192 sec to T+0.784 sec) is best fit in the 0.03-10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -0.64(-0.37, +0.46) and Ep = 707(-195, +337) keV (chi2 = 29.4/32 dof).
The resulting fluence in this energy range is 2.32(-0.50, +0.65)x10^-6 erg/cm2.
The quoted errors are at 90% CL.

All the quoted values are preliminary.

Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
