NUMBER:  10529
SUBJECT: Swift-XRT refined position of the probable new SGR 1833-0832

J.M. Gelbord (PSU) and L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 959 s of XRT data for BAT trigger #416485 (Gelbord
et al. GCN Circ. 10526), from 80 s to 1.3 ks after the BAT trigger.
The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The refined XRT
position for this burst is RA, Dec 278.435, -8.519 which is
equivalent to
  RA(J2000)  =  18h 33m 44.4s
  Dec(J2000) = -08d 31m 08.4s
with an uncertainty of 5.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  We note
that this position is 3.5 arcsec from the XRT position and 63.5
arcsec from the BAT position reported by Gelbord et al. (GCN Circ.
10526).

At this time we cannot confirm whether the source is decaying.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
