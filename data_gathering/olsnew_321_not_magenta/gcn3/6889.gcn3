Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071011 (trigger #293924)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 6882).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 8.395, 61.132 deg  which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  0h 33m 34.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = 61d 07' 57" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two roughly symmetric peaks.  The first
starts at ~T-10 sec, peaks at ~T+1 sec, and reachs a minimum at ~T+30 sec.
The second picks up at the minimum at ~T+30 sec, peaks at ~T+46 sec, and
ends at ~T+90 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 61 +- 1 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.5 to T+63.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.41 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+45.98 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
