O. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:13:06.97 UT on the 5th of October 2014, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 141005A
(trigger 434178789 / 141005217) which was also detected by
Swift (V. D'Elia et al. 2014, GCN 16682). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 107 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 3 seconds (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum
from T0-0.26 s to T0+3.07 s is best fit by a power law
function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law
index is -0.30 +/- 0.11  and the cutoff energy, parameterised
as Epeak, is 138 +/- 8 keV.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with
Epeak= 119 +/- 10 keV, alpha = -0.06 +/- 0.2 and
beta = -2.7 +/- 0.3.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
2.6 E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.5 seconds in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalogue."
