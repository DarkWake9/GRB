K. Kinugasa (Gunma Astronomical Observatory), T. Kato (Kyoto U.),
H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U.), and K. Torii (RIKEN) report:

 Starting at 12:44 UT on December 11th, the central 11x11 square
arcmin of the error region of GRB 021211 (Crew, et al., GCN 1734) was
observed with the Gunma Astronomical Observatory 0.65-m telescope
equipped with CCD camera AP8. Images were acquired with Rc filter
(30-s and 180-s exposures) and without filter (180-s exposures).

 The optical transient reported by Fox and Price (GCN 1731) is
detected. Preliminary analysis gives Rc ~ 21 mag at 13:24 UT. Further
analysis is in progress.
