We have imaged the field of GRB071101(S. McBreen,GCN 7030) with TNT 0.8m 
telescope at Xinglong Observatory, started from 17:55:20 UT, 94s after the 
burst. A series of white band and R band images were obtained. 
After combined 20*20s white band images, we found two new faint sources within 
the error region of the BAT (S. McBreen, GCN 7030).

The coordinates were 03:12:21.115 +62:28:10.31 and 03:12:41.588 
+62:28:01.9 ,respectively, with an uncertainty of 3 arsec.
The two sources were both not seen in the USNO-B1.0 and USNO-A2.0, 
Horever ,the source 2 (03:12:41.588 +62:28:01.9) are consistent with a star in 
the 2MASS ALL-SKY catalog of point sources.

The white band magnitude of two sources were 20.27+-0.22 and 
20.89+-0.36 ,respectively,derived from USNO-B1.0 R2 mag  

At the mean time, no new sources was found in the error region of XRT (C. 
Pagani,GCN 7034).

We also clearly found the galaxy reported by E. Ofek (GCN 7031) 

More detailed analysis are going!
