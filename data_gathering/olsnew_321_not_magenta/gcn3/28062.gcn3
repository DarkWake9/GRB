The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:09:53 UT on 5 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200705A (trigger 615658198.251492 / 200705674).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 60.5, Dec = -48.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 01m, -48d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 23.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 106.0 degrees.
