D. T. Durig (Cordell-Lorenz Observatory - University of the South) and A.  
Price (AAVSO) report on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy
network on optical observations of GRB050922C.

After glow reported by Rykoff et al (GCN #4011) was visible in 2 hours of
exposures. The first three measurements are below and a link to the rest
is in the full report at the bottom of the e-mail. Uncertainty is
estimated at +/-0.2 mag.

 09 23.03833 19.1 Rc
