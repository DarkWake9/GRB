J. A. Kennea (PSU) and H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) report on behalf of 
the Swift Team:

Analysis of preliminary data from the BAT trigger 339852 (GRB090113) 
reveals an uncatalogued point source at RA, Dec = 32.05816, 33.42945 which 
is equivalent to:

RA(J2000) = 02h 08m 13.9s,
Dec(J2000) = +33d 25m 46.0s

with an estimated uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). 
Analysis is ongoing and an improved analysis will be reported as soon as 
possible.
