report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:47:00.05 UT on 13 June 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 190613B (trigger 582115625 / 190613449),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (D'Ai et al. 2019, GCN 24807)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time using
the Swift-BAT position is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single bright peak
with a duration (T90) of about 5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1 s to T0+4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.96 +/- 0.05 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 334 +/- 35 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.4 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 7.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
