We imaged the field of GRB000301c (GCN #568) using the 2.34m Vainu Bappu
Telescope at Kavalur, India from March 2nd to March 4th, 2000 with clear
sky conditions.

Since the internet is down I am unable to view the images reported
in various GCN circulars. However, referring to the offset positions of
reference stars by Garnavich et al (GCN #573) and a FAX of DSS picture
the object proposed to be the counterpart of GRB000301c
(GCN #570,576) is identified in all our images.
The data reduction is in progress.
