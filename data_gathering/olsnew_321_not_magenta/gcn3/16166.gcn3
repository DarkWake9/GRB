We observed the field of GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al., GCN 16142) using the NICS 
near-Infrared camera on the 3.6m TNG Telescope (La Palma, Canary Islands).

We obtained a series of imaging observations in the J, H and K' bands(16 minutes per filter) 
at a mean epoch of 14.8 hours from the burst. The GRB afterglow is clearly detected in all bands. 
The observed J-band magnitude is 19.7 +- 0.1 (calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).
