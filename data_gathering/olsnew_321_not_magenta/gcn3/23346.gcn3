B. Mailyan (UAH), P. Veres (UAH), P. Jenke (UAH), A. Goldstein (USRA),
and C. M. Hui (MSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM team:

We have searched the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for a
gamma-ray counterpart to IceCube-181014A (GCN 23338).
The position was occulted by the Earth for Fermi at the time 
the neutrino was detected. GBM therefore cannot set any limits on 
impulsive emission.  The ground-based untargeted search of GBM data
did not find any candidates within +/- 1 hour of the event time.

Measurements using the Earth Occultation technique around this position
place a three sigma flux upper limit of about 190 mCrab for 12-100 keV 
between Oct 13th and Oct 15th.
