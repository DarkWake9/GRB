We observed the short GRB 160821B (Siegel et al., GCN 19833) with the 
AMI Large Array as part of the 4pisky program. The observations at 15 
GHz on 2016 Aug 22.85, Aug 23.82, Aug 25.83, and Sep 03.83 (UT) do not 
reveal any radio source at the VLA location (Fong et al., GCN 19854), 
with 3sigma upper limits of 138 uJy, 227 uJy, 129 uJy, and 171 uJy 
respectively.

We note that, due to power outage, the AMI-LA did not trigger 
robotically, and could only obtain the first observation 22 hours 
post-burst. This is several hours after the VLA 6 GHz detection (~3.6 
hours post-burst).

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
