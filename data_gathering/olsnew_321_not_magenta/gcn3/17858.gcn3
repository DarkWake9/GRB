DATE:    15/05/21 18:52:22 GMT
FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>

A problem developed involving the automated processing scripts 
at the Swift MOC that generated a series of messages to be sent
to the U. of Leicester automated processing which then produced
the recent cluster of Circulars to be submitted to GCN and distributed.

Please disregard Circulars 17842 through 17857;
they are from old Swift TOO observations.

The Swift Team apologies for the inconvenience.
