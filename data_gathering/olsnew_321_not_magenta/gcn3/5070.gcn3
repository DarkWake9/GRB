Images of the field around GRB 060502A (La Parola et al., GCN 5047)
were obtained with the FLWO 1.2m telescope and KepCAM beginning
on 2006 May 2.23 (UT). Four R-band exposures of 120 and 180
seconds were combined and the optical afterglow
(Cenko et al., GCN 5048) is detected but is faint.
The mean time of the combined exposures is 2.77 hours after
the burst. Using stars in the USNO-A2.0 for calibration, we
estimate the brightness of the afterglow to be R=20.1 +/- 0.3 mag.

Also using the USNO-A2.0 catalog we estimate the position of
the afterglow to be RA=16:03:42.63  DEC=66:36:03.7 (J2000)
with an error of 0.7" which is consistent with the Swift/UVOT
position (Poole et al., GCN 5068).
