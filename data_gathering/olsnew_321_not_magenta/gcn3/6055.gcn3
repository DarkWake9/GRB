Daniele Malesani (Dark, NBI), Pall Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire), Paul
M. Vreeswijk (ESO), Anreas O. Jaunsen (Univ. Oslo), and D. Alexander Kann
(TLS Tautenburg), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Using FORS2 on the ESO Very Large Telescope, we have imaged the GRB 070129
field (Godet et al., GCN 6053) on Jan 30.07 UT (2.15 hours post-burst).
Inside the refined XRT circle (Butler 2006, AJ, in press,
astro-ph/0611031; DSS catalog; version 0.2) we find an R ~ 21.3 mag
source. At present we cannot assess the source variability. It is possibly
extended but not readily visible in the DSS.

Its coordinates are:

R.A.(J2000) =  02:28:00.94
Dec(J2000)  = +11:41:04.0

with a error of 0.2" in each coordinate.

An image of the field is shown at:

We thank the Paranal staff, especially Elena Valenti, Paul Lynam and
Leonardo Vanzi, for excellent support.

[GCN OPS NOTE(03feb07): Per author's request, the sign on the 
declination was changed from minus to plus.]
