J. I. Avalos (University of Leipzig), N. P. Plaza (Universidad Autonoma de

Patras), E. Komucyeya (Mbarara University), S. Schmidl, S. Klose, D. A.
Kann, A. Nicuesa Guelbenzu, and F. Ludwig (all TLS Tautenburg) report:

We observed the field of the short GRB 160408A (Evans et al., GCN
19260) with the Tautenburg 1.34-m Schmidt telescope at as mid-time of about
15.3 hrs after the GRB trigger, at a mean airmass of 1.2. We obtained 10 x
300 sec exposures in the Ic band.

Inside the 1".9 enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne et al.,GCN 19261),
we do not detect the possible optical counterparts reported by Levan et
al. (GCN Circ. 19262). We estimate a preliminary upper limit of Ic > 21.3
mag, calibrated against USNO-B1 field stars.

These observations were performed as part of the Tautenburg Observing
School at the Thueringer Landessternwarte.
