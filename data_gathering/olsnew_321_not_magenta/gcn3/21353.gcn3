F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) 
reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

Some of the Swift UVOT exposures of GRB 170714A
previously reported by Marshall and D'Ai (GCN Circular 21351)
contain readout streaks due to nearby bright sources.
These streaks make the determination of magnitudes very difficult,
and this effect was not accounted for in the previous analysis.
The affected exposures have been removed from the corrected
table given below. As a result, the most significant detection
of a source with UVOT has been removed, and there is now
only weak evidence for a UVOT source at the position of
the z-band afterglow candidate reported by
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN Circ. 21346).

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the initial exposures are:

I apologize for any confusion caused by the earlier report.
