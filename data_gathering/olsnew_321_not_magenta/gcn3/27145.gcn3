The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:57:10 UT on 19 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200219C (trigger 603849435.33311 / 200219998).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 264.5, Dec = 8.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 37m, 8d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
