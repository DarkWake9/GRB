A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada and Univ. de Málaga), M. Bremer,
J.-M. Winters and S. Koenig (IRAM Grenoble), on behalf of a large
collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of the extraordinarily long event GRB 130925A/Sw
J0244-2609 by Swift (Lien et al. 2013, GCN 15247) we attempted on Oct 1
(00:30 UT) millimetre observations with the Plateu de Bure Interferometer
(PdBI) in the French Alps, in 6-antenna compact D configuration. Due to
the low declination, the source was lost for two antennas due to shadowing
effects by other antenna. No mm source is detected, with a 3 sigma limit
of 0.58 mJy at 86 GHz. This value is a factor of 30 times less than the
measured flux density for the tidal disruption flare candidate GRB
110328A/Sw J1644+5734 with PdBI one week post burst (Castro-Tirado et al.
2013, RMxAC 42, 36)."
