The long-duration GRB 160910A (Veres et al., GCN Circ. 19901; Racusin et al.,
GCN Circ. 19902;  INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7560) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 17:19:41.25 on 10 September 2016.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows an initial weak peak followed by a main
bright peak.  The weak initial peak starts at T0, peaks at T+3 sec and ends
at T+4 sec.  The main bright peak starts at T+4 sec, peaks at T+6 sec and
ends at T+20 sec.  Several overlapping pulses are evident in the main peak.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 20.7 +- 1.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
