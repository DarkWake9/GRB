We observed the field of GRB 161117A detected by Swift
(Cummings et al., GCN Circ. 20179) with the iTelescope.Net
(http://www.itelescope.net) T11 (20" Plane wave ) telescope
located at the AstroCamp Observatory (Mayhill, New Mexico, USA).
20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter
starting from November 17 02:02:56 (UT) about 27 minutes
after the trigger and stopped on November 17 02:45:49 (UT).
We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual
images and the stacked image at the optical afterglow position
(Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 20190).  The estimated five sigma
upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec)
is ~16.9 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
