MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)
was pointed to Konus-Wind GRB190129B  (Hurley et al. GCN23808, Frederiks et al. GCN 23809; Ttrig=2019-01-29 12:15:34.335 UT)
at 2019-01-29 17:21:59UT.
There is no OT at GROND (Bolmer et al. GCN23814) position inside Swift-XRT error-box (LaPorte et al. GCN 23813) RA,Dec=117.46104,+0.93484; +-3arcsec)
