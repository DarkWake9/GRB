C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 191119A (GCN 26258),
at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 230.10 (+4.76/-6.48 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 3.17 (+3.36/-2.09 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts
below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no
counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive,
coherent search for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the
neutrino candidate time. From this search, no significant signal was found
related to IceCube-191119A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates
(arXiv:1612.02395), we report the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):
