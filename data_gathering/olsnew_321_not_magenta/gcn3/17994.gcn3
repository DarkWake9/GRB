P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 23:56:38.54 on July 2 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150702A (trigger 457574202/150702998) which
was also detected by Fermi-LAT (G.Vianello et al. 2015, GCN 17989). 
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the LAT location and the IPN triangulation 
(K. Hurley et al. 2015, GCN 17993). 

The initial angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight was 
119 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks with a duration
(T90) of about 45 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0s to T0+26s 
is well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 987 +/- 100 keV, 
Alpha = -0.91 +/- 0.04 and Beta = -2.4 +/- 0.2. 
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.1 +/- 0.4)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.4 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
