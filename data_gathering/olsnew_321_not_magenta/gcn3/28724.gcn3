Swift observed the field of IceCube 201021A (GCN Circ. 28715) between 08:56:50
2020 October 21 and 12:05:31 on 2020 October 21, collecting a total of 3.4 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found 4 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are either known X-ray
sources, consistent with catalogued fluxes, or are unknown but with count rate
consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not claim any of
them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 201021A.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 5-8 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:
