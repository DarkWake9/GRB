SUBJECT: GRB 140928A: Swift-XRT follow-up observations

FROM:    Claudio Pagani at U of Leicester  <cp232@star.le.ac.uk>

C. Pagani (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

A second epoch of XRT data was collected on the field of the 
Fermi/LAT-detected burst: GRB 140928A (Desiante et al., GCN Circ. 16847) 
from 271 ks to 296 ks after the  Swift/BAT trigger.

The X-ray source reported in GCN Circ. 16848, Pagani et al., coincident 
with the optical source reported in GCN Circ. 16849, Varela et al., GCN 
Circ. 16851, Kopac et al., and GCN Circ. 16856, Cucchiara et al., 
measured during the first epoch of XRT observations at a mean count rate 
of 1.9 x 10^-1 count s^-1 has now faded to a mean count rate of 9.5 x 
10^-3 count s^-1 (0.3-10 keV). We therefore confirm that this is the 
X-ray afterglow of GRB 140928A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
