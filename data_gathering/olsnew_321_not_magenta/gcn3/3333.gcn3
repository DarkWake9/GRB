TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3333
SUBJECT: GRB 050502b: Swift XRT Position

C. Pagani, A. Falcone, D. N. Burrows, J. Kennea, S. Kobayashi (PSU), F. 
Marshall, and Neil Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT observed GRB 050502b (Falcone et al., GCN 3330) beginning at
09:26:43 UT.  As reported in GCN 3330, the XRT obtained only 5 photons in 
its initial centroiding image and was not able to report a prompt 
centroid.  Analysis of the first orbit of data reveals a bright, transient, 
uncataloged X-ray source at the following position:

RA(J2000) = 09:30:10.1
Dec(J2000) = +16:59:44.3

The estimated uncertainty is 5 arcseconds radius (90% containment).  We 
note that this position is 23.1 arcseconds from the BAT position reported 
in GCN 3330, and 141 arcseconds from the UVOT position reported in GCN 3330.
