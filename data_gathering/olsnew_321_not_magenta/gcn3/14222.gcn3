D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports:

I observed the location of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 14204) with 
the Wide-Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar 200-inch telescope 
on 2013-02-16 UT between 02:14 and 03:17.  A series of nine 60-second 
images each were taken in Ks, J, and H filters, followed by a second 
series in Ks.  High winds were present and seeing significantly degraded 
over the course of the observations.

The optical/NIR afterglow (Zheng et al., GCN 14205, Covino et al., GCN 
14211) is well-detected in a preliminary reduction of the Ks-band 
images.  Photometry (calibrated relative to 2MASS standards in the 
field) gives the following magnitudes:

t_mid=24.89 hours : Ks = 17.23 +/- 0.05 mag (19.07 AB)
t_mid=25.65 hours : Ks = 17.34 +/- 0.08 mag (19.18 AB)

Further observations are planned.
