E. Berger (Harvard), A. Cucchiara, and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report:

"We imaged the error circle of GRB 081226 (GCN 8729) with GMOS on the
Gemini-S telescope starting on 2008 Dec 26.04 UT.  In a single 300 sec
r-band image we detect the object located by GROND within the XRT
error circle (GCN 8731).  In addition, we find a second, fainter source
within the error circle at (J2000):
	RA = 08:02:00.44
	DEC = -69:01:48.9
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  Additional
observations are on-going to determine if either of these two sources is
fading."
