M. C. Stroh and D. Grupe (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT Team:

We have analyzed the first eight orbits of Swift-XRT data obtained for  
GRB 080523 (Stroh et al. GCN Circ. 7767), totaling 250 s of Windowed  
Timing (WT) data and 11.8ks of Photon Counting (PC) data.

The light curve can be described as a single broken power-law with an  
initial decay index of 2.17 +/- 0.04 followed by a shallower decay  
index of 0.56 +/- 0.27 with a break at T+3.5ks. We predict a count  
rate at T+48 hours of 3.2e-3 cts/s.

The WT data (93 - 343 seconds) can be modeled as an absorbed power law  
with photon index of 2.17 +/- 0.04 and a total absorbing column  
density that is consistent with the Galactic value of 2.1e20 cm^-2.  
The 0.3-10 keV absorbed (unabsorbed) flux during this time is 4.58e-10  
(4.99e-10) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
