report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 12:00:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130627B (trigger=559139).  Due to an Earth limb constraint
Swift could not immediately slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 181.932, -55.730 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 07m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 43' 47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.4
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (samantha.oates AT ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
