K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus teams, report:

At least 10 short, intense SGR-like bursts have been detected by Konus
and Ulysses on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of November.  Although
it is not possible to localize them at the present time for technical
reasons, it is likely that they originate from SGR1900+14.  This will
be confirmed as soon as possible.
