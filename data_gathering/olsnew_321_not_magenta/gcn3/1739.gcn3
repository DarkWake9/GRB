report:


The stellar field containing the afterglow of the HETE burst GRB 021211
(HETE 2493; Fox et al., GCN 1731) was observed with the Tautenburg Schmidt
telescope in R and I on Dec. 11, 23:00 - 23:40 UT, i.e. 12 hrs after the
burst trigger.

We do not detect the afterglow. We estimate that at this time the source
was already fainter than R=22.7 and I=20.7.
