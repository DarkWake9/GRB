and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) has been observing
high bursting activity of SGR 1935+2154 since the CGBM trigger
at ~18:32 UTC on 27 April 2020.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because
the real-time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal).
This trigger followed the Swift and Fermi-GBM triggers on bursts
from SGR 1935+2154 at ~18:20 UTC reported in GCNs 27657, 27659, and 27660
(at this time CGBM HV was off).
The CGBM data display a burst cluster along with multiple
short bright bursts.

The first CGBM trigger was shortly followed by another CGBM trigger at
18:46:08.675 UTC (trigger 1272047979:
http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1272047979/index.html)
with several intense bursts.

Additional two unalerted CGBM triggers with multiple short intense soft
bursts were detected at ~20:15 UTC and ~21:49 UTC on 2020-04-27.
After this, CGBM on-board trigger was disabled because it reached the
maximum numbers of the accepted triggers.

Further episodes of SGR activity were observed in CGBM TH data at
~23:18 UTC on 2020-04-27 and at ~00:43 - 00:57 UTC on 2020-04-28.

Totally several tens of short bright SGR bursts have been detected by CGBM
so far. So, SGR 1935+2154 did enter a new phase of activity
as was suggested in GCN 27623.
