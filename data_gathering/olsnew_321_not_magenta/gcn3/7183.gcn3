N. R. Tanvir, K. Wiersema (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick),
A. Adamson and C. Davis (JACH) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of XRF080109/SN2008D (GCN7159, GCN7160, GCN7169)
with UKIRT/UFTI on 2008-01-12 (13 UT) and on 2008-01-15 (14 UT) in
good conditions, using the JHK filters on each occasion.  Between the
two epochs we estimate that the optical transient brightened by
approximately 0.35+/-0.05 mag in each band, confirming the onset of a
slowly rising supernova component.
