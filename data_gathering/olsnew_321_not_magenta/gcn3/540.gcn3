"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and Wide Field Camera
(WFC unit 1) observed a strong gamma-ray burst on February
10.36396 UT. A preliminary analysis reveals a duration of about 20 s in
the GRBM, with a peak photon countrate of 22083 cts/s in the 40-700 keV
energy band. In the WFC, the duration is the same and the peak flux
is 7.4 Crab (2-26 keV). The position of the X-ray counterpart is R.A. =
01h59m14.9s Decl. = -40d40'.14 (equinox 2000.0) with a 99% error radius of
2'. An NFI follow-up is being carried on."
