"We have observed GRB 051111 with HIRESr on the Keck telescope
for 1800s starting UT 07:03.  We detect a series of strong MgII,
FeII and SiII absorption features at a redshift z=1.55.  Because we
detect no additional features redward of the MgII doublet, we
adopt this as the redshift of GRB 051111."

A full analysis is underway.
