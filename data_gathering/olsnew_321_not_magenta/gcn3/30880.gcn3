The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:12:27 UT on 25 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210925A (trigger 654289952.965146 / 210925800).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 347.4, Dec = -17.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 09m, -17d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 82.0 degrees.
