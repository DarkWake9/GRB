The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of
GRB050505 on May 06, 2005 at 00:09:08 UT, ~48 minutes after the initial
Swift BAT trigger (Hullinger et al, GCN 3364) (the delay in observations
was due to the Earth-limb constraint, which prevented an immediate slew).
Initial data is limited to one 100s exposure in each of four filters. 
We detect no source at the Swift XRT position (Kennea et al, GCN 3365) in 
any filter. The limiting magnitudes (5-sigma in 6" radius apertures) in 
each of the UVOT filters are as follows:

Filter Lim_Mag Duration (s) T_start (s)

V      ~17.7    100         T + 2870
U      ~18.4    100         T + 3180
UVW1   ~18.9    100         T + 3080
UVM2   ~19.7    100         T + 2970

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
