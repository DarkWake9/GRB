A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL), T. Sakamoto (AGU) and
M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:49:07 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160424A (trigger=683906).  Swift did not immediately slew
to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 319.481, -60.405 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 21h 17m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = -60d 24' 18"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.7
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
