At 12:31:22 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 161014A (trigger=717500).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 332.628, +7.486 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 10m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 29' 09"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows any short peaks
with a total duration of about 35 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:33:24.5 UT, 121.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in 574 s of promptly downlinked
data, which covered 0% of the BAT error circle. We are waiting for the
full dataset to detect and localise the XRT counterpart. 

No UVOT data is available at this time. 

We note that this BAT trigger time is within 7 sec of a Fermi-GBM trigger
(trigger= 498141079). 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (judith.racusin AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
