D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The Palomar 60-inch telescope responded automatically to GRB 130604A 
(Melandri et al., GCN 14752) and began a series of images at 06:58:16 
UT, three minutes after the alert notice.  We detect a faint (~20 mag) 
source near the center of the XRT error circle in the initial 60-second 
r-band and i-band exposures.  It is not clearly detected in z-band.  The 
coordinates of the optical transient candidate are:

RA  = 16:40:45.290
DEC = +68:13:33.58
(+/- 0.9", J2000)

Observations are continuing.
