D. Kocevski and J. S. Bloom (U.C.  Berkeley), on behalf of a larger  
collaboration, report:

"We performed image subtraction between multiple r-band observations  
of the error box of SHB 071112B (Perri et al. GCN 7058; Fenimore et  
al. 7071) on Gemini South.  The first epoch of observations began at  
2007-11-13 00h14m UTC (airmass ~2.0) followed by a second epoch ~4  
hours later at 2007-11-13 04h08m UTC (airmass ~2.6), with total  
exposures of 1800 sec and 1043 sec, seconds respectively.  Image  
subtraction using the public IPP package (*) software shows no  
variable sources to r=23.7 mag (3 sigma) within the >95% of the BAT  
error circle.  No further observations are planned."
