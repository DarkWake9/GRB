Harvey Moseley (GSFC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 140114A (Troja et al., GCN 15728) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/01 15.32 to 2014/01 15.55 UTC (19.72 to
25.20 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.36 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.48 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

The optical/NIR source detected by RATIR last night (Butler et al., GCN
15732) has now faded below our detection limit.  In comparison with the
SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 23.67
  i     > 23.52
  Z     > 22.56
  Y     > 21.98
  J     > 21.87
  H     > 21.33

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
