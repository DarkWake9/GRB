Swift Team:

At 11:50:40 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GX 5-1 (trigger=517876).  Swift did not slew
to this source because of the Moon observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 270.260, -25.087, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 01m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = -25d 05' 13"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This is 0.6 arcmin from the GX 5-1 location. 
This was a 13-min image trigger, and as typical the TDRSS lightcurve
does not show any activity. 

Because of the Moon observing constraint, there will be no slew
and therefore no XRT or UVOT data on this target.  We also note 
that the on-board identification for this trigger went out
on the GCN Notices as SAX_J1819.3-252 which is not correct and
it did not find the the GX 5-1 entry, and as such this caused
a notice to be issued.  The correct identification is the ground
identification of GX 5-1, and is believed to be in its normal
range of variability.
