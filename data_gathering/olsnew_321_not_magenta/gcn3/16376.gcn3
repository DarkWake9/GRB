SUBJECT: GRB 140610A: Swift-XRT observations

J.A. Kennea (PSU), G. Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), M. Perri (ASDC), P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 140610A at 17:58:18.3 UT,
5209.0 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 286.26822, 3.90743
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 05m 04.37s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 54' 26.7"
with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 29 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.19
x 10^22 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
