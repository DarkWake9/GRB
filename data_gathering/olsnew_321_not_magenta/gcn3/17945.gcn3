D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 08:52:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located 
V404 Cyg (trigger=644596) again, with a somewhat higher flux level than the 
previous triggers.  Swift did not slew promptly to the source due to an 
observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 305.998, +33.864 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 24m 00s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 51' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed some weak variability. 
The peak count rate was ~1637 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger.
