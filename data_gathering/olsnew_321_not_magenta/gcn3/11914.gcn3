We observed the ionospheric perturbation on Apr. 7th which started at
14:06:21 UT from 3 different VLF receivers, so called SID monitors
(Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance) on ICV channel 20.27kHz. This event
is with a high probability GRB 110407A (Wolf et al., GCN 11895). The
detectors are located in Bojnice (Slovakia), Hlohovec (Slovakia) and
Brno (Czech Republic). Those places are so far apart that we can rule
out a possibility of a local disturbance.

The plot from all three SID-monitors is here:

Further analysis is ongoing.
