We observed the field of S190814bv (GCN 25324, GCN 25333) in r' band with
the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) equipped with Omegacam (1 sqdeg FOV)
(Proposal ID ESO 0103.D-0070 ).
In the first night we imaged 18 sqdeg covering 65% of the localization
probability region. The observations started on 2019-08-15 at 08:50:26.860
and ended at 10:13:47.602 UT. The seeing was below 2" in thin conditions.
In the second epoch we modified the pointings to improve the updated skymap
coverage. The area imaged is 23 sqdeg covering 87% of the localization
region.
The observations started on 2019-08-16 at 05:29:37.904 and ended at
07:20:36.231. The seeing went down to 0.5" in thin conditions.
Each 1 sqdeg pointing was observed three times for a total exposure time of
135 seconds.
Automatic data processing was done with the VSTTube pipeline (Grado et al.
2012 Mem.SAIt 19, 362).
The pointing sequence was generated using the GWsky script (
https://github.com/ggreco77/GWsky).
Analysis of the images is in progress.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO User Support Department and
from ESO observing staff in Paranal.
