N.P.M. Kuin (MSSL/UCL) and J. K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC) report on
behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080229 (trigger #304379),
Canizzo et al. GCN CIRC. 7335) starting 2008:02:29 at 17:06:22 UT
with a 9.4 s setling image followed at 17:06:41 UT with a finding
chart. No afterglow is detected at the position of the enhanced
XRT position in the finding chart, nor in the three subsequent
exposures.

The source is near a bright star and may be affected by it.
Therefore a small aperture was used and the background was determined
for a region at equal distance to the nearby star.

The following 3-sigma upper limits (in the UVOT photometric system,
Breeveld et al., GCN Circ. 6614) were determined at the XRT
position (RA=15:12:52.53, DEC= -14:42:19.3, J2000):

Filter  Tstart(s)  Tstop(s)  Exp(s)  Mag (3-sigma Upper Limits)

 wh      101       200        99.8   > 20.9
 v       208       608       400.0   > 19.9
 wh      856       956        99.8   > 20.9
 v       962      1362       400.0   > 19.9

The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.15 mag in the
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
