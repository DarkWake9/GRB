Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200608A (trigger #976692)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 27906).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 309.628, -31.194 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 38m 30.7s
   Dec(J2000) = -31d 11' 39.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses that start
at ~T+20 s and ends at ~T+150 s. The two main peaks occur at
~T+18 s and ~T+70 s, respectively. There may be an additional weak pulse
at ~T-100 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 119.2 +- 34.7 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+18.09 to T+147.94 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.05 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+70.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
