SUBJECT: Swift XRT and UVOT refned analysis of GRB 090720

D. Grupe (PSU), S. R Oates (MSSL-UCL), E. A. Hoversten (PSU), P.A.  
Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:


Swift XRT and UVOT started observing the field of GRB 090720 11 hours  
after the Fermi GBM  and Swift/BAT triggers (Rau et al. GCN circ 9688,  
Cummings et al. GCN circ 9694).

Using 1233 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and one UVOT image, we  
find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT  
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):  
RA, Dec = 203.68020, -10.33480 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  13 34 43.25
Dec (J2000): -10 20 05.3

with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, arXiv:0812.3662).

Swift has continued observing the field of GRB 090720 and the source  
is clearly fading. Currently it is at a level of less than 1.6e-3  
counts/s (or 5.0 e-14 ergs/s/cm2). Due to the low number of counts, no  
spectral analysis can be performed.

With the Swift/UVOT,  we do not detect any source at the Swift XRT  
position. The 3-sigma upper limits for the summed exposures is:

Filter   T_start(s)   T_stop(s)   Exp(s)  Mag (3-sigma upper limit)
-------------------------------------------------------------
white      41,776      63,952      579          > 21.28
u          39,573      63,855      3513         > 21.10
-------------------------------------------------------------

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction along the line of sight of E_(B-V) = 0.05 mag.
All photometry is on the UVOT photometric system described in Poole et
al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.

the "finding chart exposure" was changed to "summed exposures".]
