B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
J. A. Kennea (PSU), H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and
T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:26:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150901A (trigger=654042).  Swift did not slew due Sun observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 183.586, +25.038, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 14m 21s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 02' 19"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 00:01 UT on 2015 October 28. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (boris.sbarufatti AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
