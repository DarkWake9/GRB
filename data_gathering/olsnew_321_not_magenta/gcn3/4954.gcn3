K. Yanagisawa (OAO/NAO) and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on
behalf of the Mitsume Collaboration:

"The field of GRB060403 (Boyd et al. GCN 4945, Mangano et al. GCN 4947)
was observed with the 3-color MITSuME 50cm Telescope at Okayama, Japan
starting at 16:59 UT until 16:22 UT (mid-epoch 16:10 UT, t_burst+3 hr)
in g', Rc, and Ic bands simultaneously.

With the total effective exposure of 18 min (60s x 18 frames), 
we did not detect a source brighter than g'=18.3, Rc=18.3, and Ic=17.9. 
(3 sigma) at the position of the XRT error circle.
