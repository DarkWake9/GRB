and K.L. Page report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 210822A (Page et al. GCN
Circ. 30677), from 64 s to 58.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 1.2 ks in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Evans et
al. (GCN Circ. 30682).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=0.93 (+0.09, -0.06). At T+145 s  the decay
steepens to an alpha of 3.2 (+1.8, -0.8). The light curve breaks again
at T+157 s to a decay with alpha=1.081 (+0.016, -0.015),  again at
T+3863 s s to alpha=1.81 (+0.12, -0.11),  and  again at T+22.4 ks s to
alpha=-0.1 (+0.5, -1.4),  before a final break at T+29.6 ks s after
which the decay index is 1.7 (+/-0.3).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.829 (+/-0.019). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.89 (+/-0.07) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.5 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.77 (+/-0.12) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 2.3 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 4.0 x 10^-11 (5.2 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     2.3 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.5 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 3.1 sigma
Photon index:	     1.77 (+/-0.12)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.7, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.050 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.0 x
10^-12 (2.6 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
