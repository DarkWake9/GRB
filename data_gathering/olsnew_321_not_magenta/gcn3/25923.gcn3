The transient ZTF19acbpqlh (AT2019rpn) was reported by Stein et al.
(GCN 25899) at r = 20.02 within the 95% localisation bayestar map (LVC
et al. GCN 25876).

ATLAS covered this region on 6 recent epochs, and forced PSF
photometry on the difference images at the position of this transient
gives the following 3-sigma limiting magnitudes and two 4-sigma detections. 

58752.21516 c < 18.24    
58754.21109 o < 18.71    
58755.35411 c < 21.00    
58756.60703339205 == s190930t discovery 
58756.2132  c < 19.47    
58757.23448 o 19.84 +/- 0.26
58758.21185 o 19.68 +/- 0.27

All mags are AB. 

c = cyan filter (a g+r composite)
o = orange filter (a i+r composite) 

Tan et al. (GCN 25916) reported r = 20.7 +/- 0.3 which could imply a
significant fade, although the uncertainty is significant. Our
measurements imply the transient is flat or slowly rising.

Karambelkar et al (GCN 25921) give a tentative identification of broad
H-alpha in their blue spectrum. Our ATLAS photometry would support
their conclusion of a young, relatively faint, type II SN. But further
data are required to confirm.
