Observatory Team:

At 19:38:05 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200729A (trigger=984929).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 184.375, +45.582 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 17m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 34' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~10 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 19:40:25.5 UT, 140.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 184.37782, 45.59380 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 12h 17m 30.68s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 35' 37.7"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 43 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.07 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 6.5
(+3.87/-3.22) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
303 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.01. 

The XRT position is within the extent of the nearby galaxy NGC 4242,
for which SIMBAD lists a redshift of 0.00176 (~7.4 Mpc). Follow up
observations are strongly encouraged.
