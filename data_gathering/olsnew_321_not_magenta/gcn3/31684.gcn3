J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (U Tampa), K. L. Page (U Leicester),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) report on
behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 16:13:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220305A (trigger=1095215).  Due to a viewing constraint,
Swift did not immediately slew.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 107.584, -37.708 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 10m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 42' 29"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+46.5
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is R. Caputo (regina.caputo AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
