E. A. Hoversten (PSU) and C. A. Wolf (PSU) report on behalf of the  
Swift team:

We have analyzed 8.3 ks of XRT data for the IPN detected burst GRB  
111205A (Hurley et al.  GCN Circ. 12626) from 828 to 853 ks after the  
burst.  The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.   
Previously an uncataloged X-ray source was detected by XRT 200 ks  
after the burst (Wolf & Hoversten GCN Circ. 12630) which was  
identified as the potential afterglow for GRB 111205A, but could not  
be confirmed as it was not possible to discern if the source was  
fading in a single observation.  The follow-up observation reveals  
that the source is still detected, but has faded by a factor of 4,  
which corresponds to a decay index of 1.0 (+1.3, -0.6) which is  
consistent with a GRB late time afterglow.  Thus we conclude that the  
X-ray source previously reported is the afterglow.
