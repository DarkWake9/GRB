Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141004A (trigger #614390)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 16878).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 76.721, 12.828 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 06m 53.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +12d 49' 41.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak starting with a weak
emission at T-1 sec, the FRED peak starting at T_0.0, peaking at T+0.1 sec,
and returning to baseline at ~T+20 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.92 +- 1.07 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.84 to T+5.34 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.86 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
