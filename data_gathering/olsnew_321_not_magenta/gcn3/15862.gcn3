Skynet continued observing the Swift-BAT localization of GRB 140213A 
(Holland et al., GCN 15825, Swift trigger 586569) with the 14-inch R-COP 
telescope at Perth Observatory, Australia, and with four 16-inch 
telescopes of the PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile.  Previous observations 
with R-COP began at 59s and continued until 92m post-trigger (Trotter et 
al., GCN 15828). Observations resumed with PROMPT-CTIO at t=5.5h, and 
continued at R-COP and PROMPT-CTIO until t=32h, during which time the 
afterglow rebrightened (Trotter et al., GCN 15859).

R-COP and PROMPT-CTIO took a total of 284x160s exposures in BVRI between 
t~5-5.3d. In stacked images, we continue to detect an uncatalogued 
optical source in R and I bands at the position of the source detected 
by the Swift UVOT (Siegel & Holland, GCN 15826). After the rebrightening 
at t~1d, the source clearly resumed fading.

Band      tmid       mag
I         5.3d       20.7 (+/-0.2)
R         5.2d       21.3 (+/-0.3)
V         5.3d      >21.7
B         5.3d      >21.6

Magnitudes are in the Vega system, calibrated to ten APASS-DR7 stars in 
the field, and have not been corrected for the Galactic foreground 
extinction corresponding to E(B-V)=0.07 (Schlegel et al. 1998).

No further Skynet observations are scheduled.
