D. A. Frail (NRAO), and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger NRAO/Caltech collaboration:

"We have observed the X-ray source (GCN #178) in the error box of GRB
981226 (GCN #174) with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 4.86 GHz on
Dec. 27.00 UT and at 8.46 GHz on Dec 29.92 UT. No sources are visible
within the region bounded by the NFI error circle above a 4-sigma
level of 148 microJy (4.86 GHz) and 108 microJy (8.46 GHz) on these
two days. In particular, we find no radio counterparts to the two
optical objects noted by Galama et al. (GCN #172) and Castro-Tirado et
al. (GCN #173)."
