On behalf of the Swift-BAT and BATSS teams:


Using the event data from T-83 to T+37 seconds, we present further
analysis of GRB 080702B.  The best-determined position in BAT was
RA, Dec 355.616,  -5.424 (J2000) or

RA = 23h 42m 27.8s
Dec = -05d 25' 26.4"

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcmin (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was varying (the entire burst occurred during a
preplanned Swift slew manuever), but was approximately 60% during
the entire burst.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with a few
second rise, and slow decay.  T90 was 20 +- 3 seconds (estimated
error including systematics). 

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2 to T+21 seconds is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.44 ± 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band was
(5.0 ± 0.9) x 10^-7 ergs/cm2/s.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+4 sec in the 15-150 keV band was 0.5 +- 0.1 photons/cm2/s. 
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
