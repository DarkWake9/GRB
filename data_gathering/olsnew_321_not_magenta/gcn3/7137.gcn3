P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind and
Konus-A teams report:

The bright GRB 071125 (Golenetskii et al., GCN 7136) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=50197.159 s UT (13:56:37.159).
This burst also triggered Konus-A (Cosmos 2421) at T0=50202.287 s UT 
(13:56:42.287).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 7.42(-0.22, +0.31)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+2.784 s
of 2.29(-0.36, +0.37)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).
The burst shows strong spectral evolution.

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+15.616 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 3 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.62 +/- 0.05,
the high energy photon index beta = -3.10(-0.41, +0.25),
the peak energy Ep = 299 +/- 13 keV (chi2 = 78.6/67 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
