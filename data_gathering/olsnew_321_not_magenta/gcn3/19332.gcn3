and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160419A (Markwardt et al., GCN circ. 19326; Mailyan et al., 
GCN circ. 19327) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 15:16:35.4 on 
19 April 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the HXM shows several spikes.  The emission starts from T0-2 sec, 
peaks at T0+3 sec and ends at T0+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the HXM2 data 
is 6.2 +- 0.9 sec (50-250 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
