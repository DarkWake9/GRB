report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B triggered a long burst,
GRB 210413A, at 2021-04-13T01:07:25.600 UTC (denoted as T0).

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 8 keV - 115 keV, 
this burst mainly consists of multiple pulses with duration of about 5 s.

Although the in-flight calibration of energy response and localization
has not been finalized yet, GECAM-B localized this burst to the 
following position (J2000):
Ra: 68.6 deg 
Dec: 11.3 deg 
Err: 3.6 deg (1-sigma, statistical only) 

The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration. 

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

The GECAM preliminary location could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
