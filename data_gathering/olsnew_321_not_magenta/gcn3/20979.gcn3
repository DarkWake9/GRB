and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170330A (D'Avanzo et al. GCN Circ. 20944;
Sharma et al. GCN Circ. 20969; Kozlova et al. GCN Circ. 20974) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:27:27.91 on 30 March 2017.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows several peaks.  The bright burst episode
starts at T-5 sec and ends at T+20 sec.  Two late time emissions at T+120 s
and T+150 s, which triggered Swift/BAT, are barely visible in the HXM data.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 18.5 +- 2.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
