E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"Beginning on September 13.49 we observed the IPN error box of GRB000911
(GCN #791) with the VLA at 8.46 GHz.  We find only one bright radio
source, which is cataloged in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), within the
error region.  No other radio sources are detected with a flux density
level above a 3-sigma value of approximately 150 microJy.  Further
observations are planned."
