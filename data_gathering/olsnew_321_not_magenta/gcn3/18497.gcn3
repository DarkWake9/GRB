L. P. Singer (NASA/GSFC), M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech), R. Ferretti
(Stockholm), S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), T. Barlow (Caltech), Y. Cao
Caltech), R. Laher (IPAC), and J. Rana (IUCAA) report on behalf of the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) collaboration:

We have performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G194575 using the
Palomar 48-inch Oschin telescope (P48). The anti-sun probability island
from the BAYESTAR localization was observable from Palomar for most of the
night and weather conditions were good. Starting at 2015-10-23 03:26 UTC,
about 14 hours after the GW trigger, we imaged 160 fields spanning 1114
deg2. We estimate a 17% prior probability that these fields contain the
true location of the source.

Sifting through candidate variable sources using image subtraction by both
our NERSC and IPAC pipelines, and applying standard iPTF vetting
procedures, we flagged the following optical transient candidates for
further follow-up:

Where relevant, we have given equivalent designations by Pan-STARRS
(Smartt et al., GCN 18451, GCN 18484) and La Silla-QUEST (Rabinowitz et
al., GCN 18473).

The following sources are coincident with galaxies with redshifts
(spectroscopic or photometric) < 0.1: iPTF15dkm, iPTF15dlc, iPTF15dld,
iPTF15dlj, iPTF15dln, iPTF15dmn, iPTF15dni, iPTF15dkv, iPTF15dkn,
iPTF15dkk, iPTF15dnh.

iPTF15dlc may be a variable star superimposed on a nearby galaxy.

iPTF15dni appeared to fade by 0.5 mag in one day, but its position in the
nucleus of its host galaxy makes the host-subtracted photometry
questionable. We will obtain further follow-up to confirm the fading.

iPTF15dmk and iPTF15dmq lacked any plausible host galaxy or quiescent
counterpart in SDSS or archival iPTF images, but showed no significant
intra-night photometric evolution.

iPTF15dlb (our designation of PS15byt) is a known nova in the galaxy IC
1613 (Williams & Darnley, ATel #8061).

The following candidates coincided with galaxies with redshifts > 0.1:
iPTF15dmv, iPTF15dkt.

The following sources had no known redshift but showed unremarkable
photometric evolution: iPTF15dmt, iPTF15dmu, iPTF15dms, iPTF15dmp,
iPTF15dmf, iPTF15dmb, iPTF15dlz, iPTF15dlv, iPTF15dlu, iPTF15dlr,
iPTF15dlp, iPTF15dlg, iPTF15dla, iPTF15dkj.

The following sources were previously known SNe or AGNs: iPTF15dku,
iPTF15dmr, iPTF15dmj, iPTF15dls, iPTF15dlo, iPTF15dlm, iPTF15dll,
iPTF15dli, iPTF15dlk, iPTF15dko.

iPTF15dku is our designation for LSQ15bjb. We report the following
additional photometry:
  -377.25 days: R < 20.21
    +0.71 days: R = 18.62 +/- 0.13
    +1.71 days: R = 18.15 +/- 0.15

In summary, we encourage further follow-up of iPTF15dkm, iPTF15dld,
iPTF15dlj, iPTF15dln, iPTF15dmn, iPTF15dni, iPTF15dkv, iPTF15dkn,
iPTF15dkk, iPTF15dnh, iPTF15dmk, iPTF15dmq.

Positions are stated in the ICRS. Times are in UTC. Magnitudes are based
on image subtraction; they are in the Mould R filter and in the AB system,
calibrated with respect to point sources in SDSS as described in Ofek et
al. (2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664065).

shows the locations of our candidates and the P48 fields in relation to
the LIGO/Virgo localization.
