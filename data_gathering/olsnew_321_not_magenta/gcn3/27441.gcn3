The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:53:16 UT on 25 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200325B (trigger 606840801.036936 / 200325620).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 166.9, Dec = 26.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 07m, 26d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 101.0 degrees.
