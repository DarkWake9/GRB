We observed the field of GRB 070311 (Mereghetti et al. GCN 6189)
with the 152 cm Loiano telescope in the Rc band in clear sky conditions. 
One 1800 sec exposure was obtained, significantly deeper than the 
DSS catalogue. The afterglow found by Covino et al.(GCN 6190) 
is detected with R = 22.3+/0.2 based on the NOMAD catalog. 
Our obsevation was done on 2007 March 13.792 UT middle exposure time.
