MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB141031B 33 sec after notice time 
and 88 sec after trigger time at 2014-10-31 14:58:13 UT in two 
polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within SWIFT error-box (Gompertz et al GCN 16998).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.0 mag
