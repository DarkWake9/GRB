The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 07:45:45 UT on 11 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201111A (trigger 626773550.984268 / 201111323).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 80.6, Dec = -16.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 22m, -16d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64.0 degrees.
