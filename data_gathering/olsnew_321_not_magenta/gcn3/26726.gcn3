D. Kocevski (NASA/MSFC) and J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team and the GBM-LIGO/Virgo group

At the time of S200112r, Fermi was passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly from 5.1 minutes prior to 23.5 minutes after the trigger time; therefore the GBM detectors were disabled.
