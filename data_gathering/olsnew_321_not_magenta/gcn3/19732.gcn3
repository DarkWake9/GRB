report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:34:07.72 UT on 26 July 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160726A (trigger 491189651 / 160726065),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Starling et al. 2016, GCN 19731).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi-LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two short peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 0.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.06 s to T0+0.77 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.0 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 540 +/- 100 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.01 +/- 0.05)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.06 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
