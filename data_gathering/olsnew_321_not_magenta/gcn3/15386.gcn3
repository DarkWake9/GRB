SUBJECT: Swift Trigger 575905: KAIT Optical Upper Limit

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift Trigger 575905 (Cenko et al.,
GCN 15384) starting at 06:42:00 UT, 148 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
V, I, and clear(roughly R) filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. Comparing to the SDSS image, we do not detect
new sources within BAT error circle. Typical limiting magnitudes
of our single clear image is about 18.7.
