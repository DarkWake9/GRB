GRB 181110A: optical observations from iTelescope SSO

The field of bright long GRB 181110A (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 23413)
was observed remotely from Siding Spring using iTelescope.Net T17
instrument (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + FLI PL4710 CCD) on 09:49-09:55
UT. Four unfiltered 60-sec exposures were obtained, until the
telescope was occupied by the other scheduled user. The optical
transient is well detected on 4 images and slowly fading, in
accordance with Yamanaka et al., GCN Circ. 23414. The following
magnitudes were measured using the nearby star USNO-B1.0 0531-0876625
as a reference with R2=14.80 in USNO-B1.0:
