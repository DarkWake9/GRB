C. Pagani (PSU), D. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT
team:

We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit of observation of GRB
060313 (Pagani et al., GCN 4867). We find an uncatalogued source at the
following location:

RA(J2000) = 04h 26m 28.4s
Dec(J2000) = -10d 50m 41.5s

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This position is 103 arcseconds from the BAT position given in GCN 4867.  A full
analysis of the XRT data will follow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
