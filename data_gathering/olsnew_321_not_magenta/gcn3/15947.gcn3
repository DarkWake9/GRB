D. Xu (DARK/NBI), C.-H. Bai, X. Zhang, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the BAT error circle of GRB 140311A (Racusin et al., GCN
15944) using the 1m telescope located in Nanshan, Xinjiang, China.
Observations started at 21:26:44 UT on 2014-03-11 and some R-band
frames were obtained.

A seemingly varying optical source is clearly detected in each image
at coordinates

R.A. (J2000) = 13:57:13.27
Dec. (J2000) = +00:38:31.07

Uncertainty radius: ~1 aecsec

This object is not present in both SDSS and DSS. We thus suggest it
may be the afterglow of the burst.

Observations are ongoing.
