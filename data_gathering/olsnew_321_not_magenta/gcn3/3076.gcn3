N. Masetti, L. Nicastro, on behalf of the REM/ROSS team, report:


"On Mar 07, 2005 the field of GRB050306 (Markwardt et al. GCN 3071)
has been observed with the REM telescope located in La Silla (Chile).

The field was imaged with both REM instruments (REM-IR and ROSS) in 
R, J, H and Ks filters starting at 8:28 UT (approximately 28.9 hours
after the burst). Total integration time was of 32, 84, 84 and 94
seconds respectively. A faster observation could not be performed
before due to the Moon proximity.

In the position of the possible X-ray afterglow candidate (Perri et
al. GCN 3075) no new source is clearly visible in our images.

Comparison with USNO B1.0 and 2MASS catalogues did not reveal new
sources down to a limiting magnitude of R > 17.0, J > 15.4, H > 15.2
and Ks > 15.0 (3-sigma upper limit).
