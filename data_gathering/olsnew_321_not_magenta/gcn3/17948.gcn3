report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor has triggered multiple times
on the current outburst of V404 Cyg. These triggers have all
been misclassified as GRBs by the flight software.
A list of V404 Cyg triggers up to now is listed below.


It is likely that there will be more triggers from this source
as long as it remains active and we will not issue circulars
for these triggers.   We will populate our online trigger
catalog with the correct classification as soon as possible.  The
online trigger catalog is updated automatically by the HEASARC once
per day. A list of V404 Cyg triggers can be found by searching for
the 'TRANSNT' trigger type and confirming the location.
The catalog can be browsed at:

http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigtrig.html


Triggers that our duty scientist classifies
as GRBs are followed by GCN notices with a final
human-in-loop localization with a latency of 30 minutes to a few
hours after the trigger. Triggers that are not classified by a human
as GRBs are not followed by final position GCN notices.


Triggers from V404 Cyg to date:
