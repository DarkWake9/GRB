J. Mao, C.-J. Wang and J.-M. Bai report:


We observed the field of GRB 190627A (Sonbas et al. GCN Circ. 24888) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories. We performed the second epoch observation at UT 17:40:32, 28, June, 2019, about 1.3 days after the trigger. We obtained the preliminary magnitude of R~20.0. Our result seems to be consistent to those from other photometric observations at the same epoch (e.g., Pozanenko et al. GCN Circ 24900; Jelinek & Strobl GCN Circ 24903; Malesani et al. GCN Circ 24904).
