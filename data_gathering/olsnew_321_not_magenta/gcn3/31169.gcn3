The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:50:05 UT on 4 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211204B (trigger 660311410.858238 / 211204493).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 267.9, Dec = 13.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 51m, 13d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.
