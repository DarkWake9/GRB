F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
D. N. Burrows (PSU), J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 09:57:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150722A (trigger=649916).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to earth limb observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 218.272, -35.197 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 33m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 11' 46"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger (64-sec),
there is nothing significant in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.9
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
