We observed the field of GRB 090519 (Perri et al., GCN 9400) with the 
NOT equipped with ALFOSC.

At the edge of the XRT error circle, we detect a fading source at 
coordinates (J2000):

RA = 09:29:07.0
Dec = +00:10:49.1

with an error of ~0.5". The source faded by ~0.3 +- 0.10 mag between 
19.8 and 44.4 min after the GRB, suggesting that this is indeed the 
afterglow of GRB 090519. A (fainter) object is seen at the position of 
the candidate in the SDSS, which may be a bright host galaxy. On May 
19.897 UT, the source had R ~ 21.6.
