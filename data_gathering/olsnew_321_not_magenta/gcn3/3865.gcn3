J. Gorosabel, V. Casanova, R. Garrido, A.J. Castro-Tirado, 
M. Jelinek, de Ugarte Postigo, (IAA-CSIC), report:

  We have carried out R-band observations starting at 23:49 UT
  (~37 min after the GRB) with the 1.5m OSN telescope. A visual 
  comparison  reveals an object placed at:
   
   RA(J2000) = 00:48:56.1
   DEC(J2000)= 22:36:32
  
  not present on the DSS. A finding chart will be shortly available
  at http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb050824/FCs/osn.R.gif

  The object has a magnitude of R~18. Further observations would
  be required to confirm whether the object is fading."
