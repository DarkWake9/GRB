Konus-Wind, Helicon, Mars Odyssey - HEND, and RHESSI observed this
burst at 60913 s on 28 December 2003.  As observed by Konus, its
duration was 1.1s, its 15-200 keV fluence was 3x10^(-5) erg/cm2, and
its peak flux was 8.6x10^(-5) erg/cm2 s.  It had a soft spectrum, with
kT=20 keV.

Using Konus and Odyssey data, we have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=186.046, -2.629 degrees, whose
radius is 85.436 +/- 0.028 degrees (3 sigma).  As the centerline of
this annulus passes 0.011 degrees from the position of SGR1806-20, we
believe that this event is an intermediate burst from that source.
