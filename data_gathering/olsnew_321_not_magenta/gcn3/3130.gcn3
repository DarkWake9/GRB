Kuntal Misra, Atish P. Kamble and S. B. Pandey (ARIES Naini Tal), on
behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration

We observed the optical afterglow candidate (GCN 3116) localized by 
Swift-BAT (GCN 3117) using the 1.04-m telescope at ARIES, Naini Tal
starting around 2005 March 19, 16:09 UT. We acquired BVRI images
under thin passing clouds. Our preliminary R-band photometry
gives a magnitude of 19.92 +/- 0.08 at 2005 March 19, 17:16 UT after
comparing with near by USNO-A2.0 stars. Further observations are in 
progress.
