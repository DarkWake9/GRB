Report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,
(=H2656, Vanderspek et al., GCN 1997), identified
by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986). 
Observations were made on Tuesday April 8, 2003 
with the SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO.  Sixty 300s 
exposures were taken in the B Band.  Observations 
began at 03:07:27 UT and ended at 08:23:12 UT.  All 
observations were carried out under relatively good 
seeing conditions.  Aperture photometry was carried 
out based on the calibration by Henden (GCN 2082).  

We find an average magnitude of B= 19.8 +/- 0.1.

Comparison with observations carried out at USNO
and our previous observations with SARA indicate
that the afterglow was approximately 0.5 
magnitudes brighter than predicted from previous 
nights. This deviation is consistant with the excess 
light due to the underlying SN (Zeh et al., GCN 2081).

The SARA observations discussed herein were in part
made possible by generous contributions of telescope
time from Dr. J. Webb, E. Howard, Dr. M. Leake,
M. Williams and Dr. S. Shaw.
