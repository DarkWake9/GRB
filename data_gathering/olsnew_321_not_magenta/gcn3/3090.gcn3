R. Nemiroff (Michigan Tech)  report on behalf of the greater Night Sky 
Live Collaboration

The NightSkyLive.net CONCAM2 operating on Mauna Kea has recorded
fisheye images including the location of GRB050309, being sensitive
to the GRB location starting about 28 minutes before Swift trigger.  No bright
optical transient was found consistent with the GRB location on any frame.  
A 170-second exposure including the GRB region was in progress during 
the trigger time and prompt optical emission can be limited as being more 
faint than unfiltered optical CCD magnitude 3.8.  The MK CONCAM image 
at the time of trigger is here:
