and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190426c,
T0=2019-04-26 15:21:55.337 UTC (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24237), the high-voltage of the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) detectors were off
(from T0-19 min to T0+10 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger mode
at the trigger time of S190426c. Using the CAL data, we have searched for
gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band within the time interval
T0 +/- 60 sec and found no candidates.
The 90% upper limit of CAL is 2.5x10^-5 erg/cm2/s (10-100 GeV) when
the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 10%.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA=183.0 deg, Dec=-50.9 deg at T0.
