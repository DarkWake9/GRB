SUBJECT: GRB050814: SWIFT/UVOT observation

team

Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB050814 at 11:41:44 UT,
167 s after the BAT trigger (Retter et al., GCN 3799). We detect no
new source with respect to the DSS image within the XRT error circle
(Morris et al., GCN 3800) in summed images from any filter
down to the following 3-sigma magnitude upper limits:

Filter   T_range     Exp (s)   3-sig UL (mag)

V        167-13371   1375      20.5
B        313-8353    1046      21.4
U        299-7587    1187      21.2
UVW1     285-6680    1194      20.3
UVM2     271-14137   1144      20.7
UVW2     328-12464   1277      20.8

Where T_range is the time range of the summed images in seconds
post-trigger.

These magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
