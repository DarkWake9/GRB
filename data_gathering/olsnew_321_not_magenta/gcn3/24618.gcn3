The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events
consistent with the sky localization of S190521g-1-Preliminary in a time
range of 1000
seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-05-21 02:54:09.447 UTC to
2019-05-21 03:10:49.447 UTC)
during which IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the 90% spatial
containment of S190521g-1-Preliminary calculated from the map
circulated in the preliminary notice.

IceCube's sensitivity to point sources within the location spanned by the
90% spatial containment of S190521g-1-Preliminary ranges from
0.039 to 0.966 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
