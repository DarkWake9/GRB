The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:07:18 UT on 13 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190613A (trigger 582091643.234478 / 190613172).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 176.4, Dec = 64.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 45m, 64d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 11.0 degrees.
