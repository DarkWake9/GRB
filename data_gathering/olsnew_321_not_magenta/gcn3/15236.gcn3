S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
M.Tuerler (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

An off-line analysis of the IBAS WEAK Alert n. 6947 shows that this 
sub-threshold trigger (6.9 sigma) is due to a real event detected at 
12:38:35.5 UT of September 20 in the IBIS/ISGRI data.

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

  R.A.: 266.406 deg
  DEC.: -29.019 deg

with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a duration of about 30 ms, a soft spectrum and a fluence of 
about 2x10^-8 erg/cmq (20-100 keV).

Its position is consistent with that of SGR J1745-29 (Rea et al. 2013, ATel n.5032)
