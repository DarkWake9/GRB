The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:34:09 UT on 3 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210503A (trigger 641763254.461374 / 210503815).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 328.9, Dec = 66.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 55m, 66d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
