F. Vitali on behalf of the REM/ROSS team, report:

"We imaged the field of GRB050128 (Antonelli, et al., GCN 2991) with
the 60cm REM robotic telescope located in La Silla (Chile).
Optical observations were carried out in V, R, I filters starting on 
2005
Jan 28, at 7:10 UT, and ending at 9:45 UT (approximately 3 hours after
the burst) . Observations have been partly affected by the presence
of the bright Moon close to the field, so only frames with short 
exposure
time can be used. The field was imaged in each filter for a total 
exposure
time of 50s.

No new sources are detected within the XRT error circle (Antonelli et
al.  GCN 2991) down to a limiting magnitude of V >18.2, R >18.2 and
I >17.9.

The source noted in the H band (Covino, et al., GCN 2999) at RA=
14:38:18.16, DEC=-34:45:44.7 (J2000) at about 13 arcsec far from the
XRT position is not visible in the optical bands. We derive a 3-sigma
upper limit of R > 18.2 at the position of this source.

Further optical-infrared observations with REM are planned to look for
any variability.

This message can be cited."
