"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060124 (GCN 4570) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 16:21:08 UT on Jan.24.
After co-adding a set of 23 images (16:21:08 - 16:59:35 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 15.7 mag."
