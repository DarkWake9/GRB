The long GRB 080623 (Swift/BAT trigger #315080 ; Ukwatta et al., GCN 7894) 
was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers 
an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 10:25:28 UT on 23 July 2008 (=T0). 
The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starting at T0, 
ending at T0+10 s with a duration (T90) of about 7 seconds. The fluence in 
100 - 1000 keV was (1.6 +/- 0.4) E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux measured 
from T0+ 8 s was 0.5 +/- 0.4 photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+10 s
is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of 2.0 -0.9+1.0
(chi^2/d.o.f =  5.6 / 8) at the 150 - 600 keV bandpass.
