GRB 010214 optical observation

M. Uemura, T. Kato, Kyoto Univ., and H. Yamaoka, Kyushu Univ., on
behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration report:

"We observed the field of GRB 010214 starting at Feb. 14, 15:44 UT,
i.e. about 7.0 hours after the burst with 0.30-m Schmidt-Cassegren
telescope (+ unfiltered CCD) at Kyoto University.  The earlier images
(total exposure 930 seconds, limiting mag about 17.5) contained the
western half of the 5' WFC error circle (GCN #933), and the later
images (starting at 16:14 UT, 7.5 hours after the burst, total
exposure 1500 seconds, limiting mag about 18.0) fully contained the
error circle.  Compared with the DSS images after the full reduction,
both image has shown no new source brighter than the limit, nor the
candidates reported earlier by other observers (GCN #938(optical),
#939(IR)). 

This message may be cited."
