The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:40:43 UT on 14 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200114A (trigger 600666048.723634 / 200114153).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 199.4, Dec = -0.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 17m, 0d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
