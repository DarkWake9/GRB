M.Zhai, L.P. Xing, Y.L. Qiu, J.Y. Wei, J.Y. Hu, J.S. Deng and W.K. Zheng,
on behalf of EAFON report:

We have imaged the field of GRB 061110 with the TNT 0.8m telescope at
Xinglong Observatory.The first image was taken at 11:48:37 UT, 76s
after the burst. There is afaint uncatalogued source within XRT circle at
position: Ra  22:25:09.8     Dec  -02:15:30.7   J2000
This source has a mag ~19.5 in our combined White image at ~300s after the
burst. 
This coordinate is consistent with the result given by Y.C. Chen et al.(GCN5797)
and shows fading behavior, so the candidate is confirmed.
Further analysis is under progress.
