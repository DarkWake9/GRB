Skynet observed the Swift BAT/XRT localization of GRB 160325A (Sonbas et al., GCN 19222, Swift trigger=680436) with with two 16" telescopes (P5, P6) and one 24" telescope (P1) of the PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile. Starting at 2016-03-25 07:01:44 UT and continuing until 09:55 UT (t=100s-2.9h post-trigger), Skynet took a total of 211 exposures ranging from 10-160s in the V band (P6) and the I band (P1,P5).

We clearly detected a fading optical afterglow at the position first reported by Fugazza & Melandri (GCN 19223). 

A preliminary light curve is at:

Magnitudes are in the Vega System, calibrated to 4 APASS DR9 stars in the field.  Magnitudes have not been corrected for line-of-sight Milky Way dust extinction, with expected E(B-V)=0.12 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

No further Skynet observations are scheduled.
