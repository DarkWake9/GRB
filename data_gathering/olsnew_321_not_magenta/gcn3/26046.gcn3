Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191019A (trigger #930285)
(Simpson et al., GCN Circ. 26031).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 340.035, -17.340 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 40m 08.3s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 20' 23.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a complex structure with many
overlapping
pulses that starts at ~T0 and ends at ~T+90 s. The burst went out of the
BAT FOV at ~T+400 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.35 +- 4.45 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.83 to T+84.28 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.25 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.03 x 10^-5
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.7 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
