H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), M. M. Chester (PSU),
P. A. Evans (U Leicester) and O. Godet (U Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 08:49:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an excess (trigger=324122).  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 280.588, -11.494 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 42m 21s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 29' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). This position is consistent with the known
transient SWIFT J1842.5-1124 (Krimm et al. ATEL #1610 and GCN #8199 
and GCN #8200).  This is the third trigger on this source tonight. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
