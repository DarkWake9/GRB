U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131202A 
with the robotic telescope of (IAU 
station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy (member of ISSP:
Italian Supernovae Search Project).

The observations started 88m. after the 			
GRB trigger,at the end of the twilight,
with our schmidt telescope 
D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good. 				

We co-added 3 series of 20 unfiltered exposures 
of 120 sec each.						

We did not found any optical counterpart 
in the error box of the XRTcandidate
(D. Kocevski et al, GCN 15559).
