We observed the field of GRB 150716A (Kocevski et al., GCN 18027) with the 
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on 
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/07 17.16 to 2015/07 17.46 UTC (20.69 to 
27.82 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.31 hours 
exposure in the r and i bands.

In these observations, the source reported by Watson et al. (GCN 18028) is 
detected with

r 20.43 ± 0.02
i 19.89 ± 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic 
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

While these formal errors would suggest a slight fading compared to the 
first night, in a crowded field such as this one, the real errors in the 
photometry are likely to be much larger than these formal errors of 0.02 
mag. We feel that there is no strong evidence for fading. Also, as noted 
by Cenko & Perley (GCN 18029), this source is significantly outside the 
enhanced XRT error region reported by Sbarufatti et al. (GCN 18030). We 
therefore conclude that it is not the afterglow.

We see no evidence for the source reported by Cenko & Perley (GCN 18029) 
in any of our images. However, this is not unexpected, since our images 
have significantly worse image quality than theirs.
