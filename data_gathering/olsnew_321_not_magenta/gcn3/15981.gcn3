MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB140311C (M. Stanbro, 
GCN15977) 14 sec after 
notice time and 29 sec after trigger time at 2014-03-11 14:49:42.721 UT . 
On our first (10s exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within 
FERMI error-box (ra=12 47 02 dec=+58 49 46 FOV=2x4 square degrees).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.3 mag

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Tunka was pointed to the
GRB140311C (M. Stanbro,GCN15977) 35 sec after trigger time at 2014-03-11 
14:49:48.874 UT.
On our first (10s exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within
FERMI error-box (ra=12 47 02 dec=+58 49 46 FOV=2x4 square degrees).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.0 mag.

We have done survey of the large area around initial error box up to ~18 
unfiletred magnitude which was begun in 15 minutes after GRB.

The GBM error box (M. Stanbro, GCN15977) completely observed by 4-th Very 
Wide Field Cameras (FOV = 4x380 square degrees) before, during and after 
GRB without time gap up to 11 unfiltered magnitude limit on each 5 sec 
image. The reduction is continued now.

The IPN is very desirable.

The covarege map is available at 
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/GRB/GRB140311C_map.png . The elliptical 
region is the Fermi GBM 1 sigma+3 degrees systematic error box.
