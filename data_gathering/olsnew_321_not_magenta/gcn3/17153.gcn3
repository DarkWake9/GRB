(UMD) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the variable source reported by Marshall and Cenko
(GCN 17139) with the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Discovery
Channel Telescope (DCT) at Happy Jack, AZ from 2014/12/07 11:01 until
2014/12/07 11:08 UTC (starting 119.74 hours after the observations reported
by Golenetskii et al. in GCN 17131). A source is clearly detected at the
location of the source identified by UVOT in u', g', r', i' and z'. Using
nearby point sources from SDSS for calibration we measure r' = 20.57 +/-
0.03. The coincident SDSS R10 source has r' = 22.65 +/- 0.20, confirming
that the source is indeed transient. At 0.8 arcsecond seeing, the source is
unresolved.

This magnitude is reported in AB magnitude and is not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the source.

Further observations are planned to investigate possible variability of
this source.

We thank the staff of the Discovery Channel Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
