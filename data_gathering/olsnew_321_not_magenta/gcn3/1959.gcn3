P.A. Price, R. McNaught and G.J. Garradd (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 030324 (HETE trigger #2641; Donaghy
et al., GCN 1954) with the 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring Observatory.  
Observations consisted of 6x300 sec integrations in R-band at each of
three epochs and cover the entire error-circle.  Approximate limiting
magnitudes at each epoch are:

Epoch (UT)	R_lim
Mar 24.523	21.4 mag
Mar 24.727	21.0 mag
Mar 25.674	21.4 mag

We do not identify any afterglow candidates upon image subtraction between
each of the epochs or upon comparison of the first epoch with the DSS 2.

This message may be cited.
