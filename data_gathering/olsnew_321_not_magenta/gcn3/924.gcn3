GRB010126

C. Bartolini, A. Guarnieri and A. Piccioni, Departement of Astronomy,
Bologna University, and S. Bernabei, L. Fabbroni and R. Gualandi,
Bologna Observatory, communicate:
"We observed the error box of GRB010126 on January 27, 2001, in poor
weather conditions (seeing 2".5) with the 1.5 m Loiano telescope. 
Two CCD frames, 13'X13', centered on the error box center reported by
K. Hurley on GCN922, were obtained in R band with start times UT 01:05:00
(30 min) and UT 01:39:00 (20 min), respectively.
A preliminary inspection of the two frames shows a possible variable
object (r.a. 11 57 07.3, de. 49 44 26.5) not present in the DSSII-red,
barely over the plate detection limit.  This object, by comparison
between the two frames, seems to be fading.  Deeper analysis is in
progress."
