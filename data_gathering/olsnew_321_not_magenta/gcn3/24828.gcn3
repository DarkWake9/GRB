The short GRB 190610A
(Swift-BAT detection: Evans et al., GCN 24775;
Insight-HXMT/HE detection: Cai et al., GCN 24782)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=41263.560 s UT (11:27:43.560).

The light curve of the burst shows a single, multi-peaked pulse
with a total duration of ~0.6 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB190610_T41263/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a fluence of (7.65 ± 1.48)x10^-6 erg/cm^2 and
a 16-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.080,
of (2.43 ± 0.31)x10^-5 erg/cm^2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is well fitted in the 20 keV - 20 MeV range
by a cutoff power-law (CPL) function with the following model
parameters: the photon index alpha = -0.28(-0.26,+0.33),
and the peak energy Ep = 903(-181,+251) keV, chi2 = 53/47 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
nearly the same alpha and Ep, and an upper limit on beta of -2.3.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
