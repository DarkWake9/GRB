At 06:31:08, a GRB occurred during a preplanned Swift slew.  This was the same
event as Fermi GBM trigger 444724270.  A mosaic of images from BAT photon event
data revealed a bright source at RA, Dec 160.241, -64.043, which is:

RA (J2000)   10h 40m 57.8s
Dec (J2000) -64d 02' 34"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 1.5 arcmin.

The burst was a single symmetric cusp that lasted about 13 seconds.

A Swift TOO has been requested.
