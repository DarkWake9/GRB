Klotz A., Turpin D. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B.,
Boer M., Siellez K., Dereli H., Bardho O. (UNS-CNRS-OCA),
Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131218A detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 6409) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 3.41h after the GRB trigger
which occured during day. The elevation of the field
increased from 26 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures but we do not
detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:

t0+3.41h to t0+4.98h : Rlim = 19.6

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=276.4490 lat=-19.8751
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 0.4 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
