On Jan 15, 2005 the field of GRB 060114 (Mereghetti et al. GCN 4505) was 
observed with the REM telescope located in La Silla (Chile).

The field was imaged with the ROSS optical spectrograph/imager and with 
the REMIR near infrared camera in the R and K filters, respectively, 
starting at 6:10 UT (approximately 18 hours after the burst) for a total 
integration time of 1200 and 500 s, respectively.

No sources are detected within the IBAS INTEGRAL error circle down to 
limiting magnitudes R = 18.1 and K = 15.0 (3-sigma upper limits).
