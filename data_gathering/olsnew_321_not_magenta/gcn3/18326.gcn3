on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long-duration GRB 150911A (Swift-BAT trigger #655262:
Starling, et al., GCN Circ. 18280; Markwardt , et al., GCN Circ. 18292)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a total duration of ~9 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
3.13(-0.20,+0.26)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+2.5 s, of 4.01(-0.32,+0.59)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1000 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(measured from ~T0(BAT)-0.5 s to ~T0(BAT)+8.5 s)
by a simple power-law model yields the photon index
-2.32(-0.09,+0.09), chi2=0.6/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
