J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift-BAT team

At 11:43:03.7 Swift-BAT triggered on GRB 130708A (trigger 560515). No
significant source was found onboard, and rate-trigger processing was
terminated prematurely by a pre-planned slew. A significant source was found
in ground analysis at RA, Dec 17.474, 0.003, which is:

RA (J2000)   01h 09m 53.7s
Dec (J2000)  00d 00' 11.9"

with an estimated 90% error radius of 2.4 arcmin.  This position is 5.0 degrees
from the location found by Fermi-GBM for trigger 394976587, which has an
estimated error of 2.2 degrees.  The partial coding was 11%.

We note that this position is 1.6 arcmin from a Seyfert I galaxy at Z = 0.16,
[VV2003c] J010946.5-000023.

The BAT lightcurve shows a double-peaked long GRB.  The T90 of the GRB was about
9 +/- 1 seconds, with a spectral power-law index of 1.38 +/- 0.28 and a fluence
of (7.8 +/- 1.8) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2 in the 15-150 keV BAT energy range.  Error
estimates are 90% confidence.

A Swift TOO request has been approved to locate the afterglow with XRT.  Since
this burst was not located onboard, the usual automated analysis products are
not available.
