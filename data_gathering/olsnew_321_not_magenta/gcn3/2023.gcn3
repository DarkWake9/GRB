TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2023
SUBJECT: GRB030329, BVRcIc field photometry
DATE:    03/03/30 12:54:08 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 11x11 arcmin field centered at the coordinates
of the optical transient (Peterson and Price, GCN 1985)
for the HETE burst GRB030319 (GCN 1997)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one clear but very poor
seeing night.  Stars brighter than V=11.0 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030329.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
Due to the poor seeing, the external photometric error
is larger than normal for our calibrations.  This report
should be considered preliminary, with additional calibrations,
including U-band, to be performed later in the week when
weather conditions are better.

As always, you should check the dates on the .dat file prior to
final publication to get the latest photometry.
