W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on behalf of
the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus, RHESSI, and HEND observed this burst at ~51223 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~10 s, a 25-100 keV
fluence of ~3E-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of
~5E-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary,
3 sigma error box whose area is ~160 square arcminutes and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 16 h 27 m 32.31 s    -29 o 48 '  21.41 "  (CENTER)
 16 h 25 m 56.99 s    -29 o 59 '  26.08 "  (CORNER)
 16 h 27 m 59.70 s    -29 o 41 '  20.90 "  (CORNER)
 16 h 27 m 05.07 s    -29 o 55 '  20.70 "  (CORNER)
 16 h 29 m 08.79 s    -29 o 37 '  05.87 "  (CORNER)

Some improvement in this error box is possible.  A map
will be posted shortly to sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020604.
This server will be down from about 7 AM to 5 PM PDT Saturday, June
8.
