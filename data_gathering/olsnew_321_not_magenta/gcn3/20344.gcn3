A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR) and Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) reports:

We carried out Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 161219B (D'Ai et al. GCN Circ. 20296) in the 1390 MHz band on 2016 
Dec 26.68 UT. We
detect the  radio afterglow of the GRB in the Swift error circle 
(Beardmore et al. GCN
Circ. 20297). The 1390 MHz band flux density of the afterglow is 
397+/-55 uJy. Map rms is
40 uJy/beam.

Further observations are planned. We thank GMRT staff for making these
observations possible.
