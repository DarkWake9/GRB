TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5609
SUBJECT: GRB 060923C: NIR afterglow confirmed

Paolo D'Avanzo (INAF-OABr), Stefano Covino (INAF-OABr), Daniele  
Malesani (SISSA/ISAS), and Gianpiero Tagliaferri (INAF-OABr), report on 
behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

We imaged again the field of GRB 060923C (Stamatikos et al., GCN  5591) 
on 2006 Sep 25 from 0:51 to 1:36 UT with the ESO VLT+ISAAC in  the J 
band. Seeing conditions were comparable to our previous observation 
(Covino et al., GCN 5604).

With respect to the first epoch of imaging, we detect sources A and C, 
with the same brightness. Source B has faded significantly and is barely 
detectable. Image subtraction performed with ISIS also confirms the fading.

We therefore fully confirm the identification by Fox (GCN 5607) of  
source B as the afterglow of GRB 060923C.

We acknowledge support from the ESO observing staff at Paranal.
