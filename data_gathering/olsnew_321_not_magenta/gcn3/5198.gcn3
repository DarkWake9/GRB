on behalf of the BOOTES collaboration report:

Bootes-IR telescope, located at IAA Observatory de Sierra
Nevada, observed position of GRB 060602B (Trigger 213190),
starting 10.7 sec post GCN notice (= 14.5 min post GRB).

We obtained a series of R-band exposures. An object with R ~
16 mag is shown at

RA 17:49:20.14 DEC -28:07:17.95 (J2000) with estimated
uncertanity 1 arcsec

which is not at GSC-2 and USNO catalogues. It is also not
visible at DSS. According to MPC, there is not any know
asteroid nearby. We qualify this object as a possible GRB
counterpart.

Futher analysis, as well as observations, are in progress.
