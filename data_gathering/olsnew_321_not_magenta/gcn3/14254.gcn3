F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and A. Melandri (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observations of the field of GRB 130216A
3.67 days after the BAT trigger (Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 14223).
The observations were delayed because of an observing constraint
due to the Moon. No new source is seen inside the refined BAT
error circle (Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ. 14229).

The preliminary 3-sigma upper limit using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)        Mag
w1              317224       346946         7959        >22.2

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.49 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
