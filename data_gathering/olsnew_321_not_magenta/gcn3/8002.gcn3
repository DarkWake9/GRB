D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), A.Paizis, S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano),  
V.Beckmann, M. Beck, A. Manousakis (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski  
(CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A bright GRB lasting about 105 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ 
ISGRI data at 13:22:19 UT on July 23rd 2008. The refined position is

R.A.:  176.8354 deg
Dec.: -60.2452 deg

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst is very bright and has saturated the available telemetry  
share. Hence the following preliminary spectral results are to be  
considered lower limits. The peak flux over 3 s in the 20-200 keV  
energy range is 6 ph/cmsq/s, and the fluence integrated over the  
whole burst duration is 1.3e-5 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
