report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration:


Fermi-LAT observed the position of GRB 201216C, which was detected
by Fermi-GBM (GCN Circ. 29073), Swift (GCN Circ. 29061, 29064),
and MAGIC (GCN Circ. 29075).
The GRB position was not in the LAT field of view at the time
of the GBM trigger (T0 = 2019-12-16, 23:07:25.75 UT), and was not visible
until ~T0+3500 s. The position remained visible until ~T0+5500 s.

No significant high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with this burst
was detected by the LAT in this time interval.

A LAT upper limit (95% confidence level, 100 MeV - 1 GeV), assuming a
photon index of -2.0, covering the same time interval is 7.3E-7 ph/s/cm2.
The corresponding upper limit for energy flux is 3E-10 erg/s/cm2.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elena Moretti (moretti@ifae.es).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
