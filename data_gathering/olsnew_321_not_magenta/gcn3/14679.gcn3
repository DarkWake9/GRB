We observed the field of GRB 130518A (Xiong, et al., GCN 14674; Omodei,
et al., GCN 14675) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR;www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from
from 2013/05 19.44 to 2013/05 19.47 UTC (20.54 to 21.49 hours after
the GBM trigger), obtaining a total of 0.64 hours exposure in the r'
and i' bands, 0.27 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands, and 0.15 hours
exposure in the J, and H bands.

We detect a new, uncatalogued source at RA,Dec = 355.66781, +47.46493
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec.
This position is 5 arcsec from the XRT localization, just outside the
XRT error circle (Evans, et al., GCN 14678). In comparison with SDSS DR8
and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

     r'    19.38 ± 0.02
     i'    19.10 ± 0.02
     Z     18.83 ± 0.04
     Y     18.65 ± 0.04
     J     18.28 ± 0.07
     H     18.47 ± 0.11

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. We have evidence at the 2-3 sigma
level of fading in r' and i' over the duration of our observations.

Further observations are planned.

Mártir.
