Masanori Ohno(ISAS/JAXA), Veronique Pelassa(CNRS/IN2P3/LPTA) report
on behalf of the Fermi LAT team:

At 00:23:01.22 UT on 10 May 2009, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) triggered and located GRB 090510 (trigger 263607783 / 090510016).
Emission was observed in the LAT up to GeV energy band with a detection significance of more than 5 sigma.

The best LAT on-board localization is found to be
(RA,Dec=333.400, -26.767) with an error radius of 7 arcmin (statistical only).
This position is consistent with both Fermi/GBM and Swift/XRT position.

Further analysis is ongoing.
We suggest follow up observation for this burst.

The points of contact for this burst is

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to
cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S.
and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
