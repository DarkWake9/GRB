(IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  the Swift GRB 120911A (Cannizzo  et al., GCN 
13744) with 0.45-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory  starting on  Sep. 11 
(UT) 07:10:42, i.e ~130 s after burst trigger.  We took  several unfiltered 
images of 30 s and 60 s exposures.  Within enhanced XRT afterglow position 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 13748) we do not detect any new object.   A 
preliminary  photometry of single and co-added frames is based  on the 
USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby  stars is following:
