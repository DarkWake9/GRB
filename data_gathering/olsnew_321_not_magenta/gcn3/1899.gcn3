M. Uemura, R. Ishioka, T. Kato (Kyoto U.) and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U.)
report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

  We are observing the position of GRB 030227 (GCN 1895) starting at
Feb. 27 09:48 UT (1.1 hours after burst) with the 0.25-m telescope
(+unfiltered CCD) at Kyoto University.  The stacked image (30 x 30s,
up to 10:19 UT) covers the entire refined error circle (GCN 1896),
assuming that the position figures in GCN 1896 was based on the
current equinox (see Note).  Visual comparison of the stacked image to
the DSS 2 red image shows no new object down to a limiting magnitude
of about 18.0 (estimated with USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes of many field
stars).  Further observation (also with the 0.30-m telescope) and
analysis is underway. 

This message can be cited.

Note:  The preliminary position given in GCN 1895 (04:57:29,
+20:29:23, the authors say it is based on J2000.0) coincided with the 
position given in the GCN/INTEGRAL NOTICE at 09:29:48 UT (hereafter
GIN) based on the current equinox.  If the position in GCN 1896 is
truely based on the equinox J2000.0, the refined error circle
intersects the initial error circle reported in GIN, and our stacked
image covers about 70 percent of the refined error circle.  Our field
of view covers about 80 percent of the initial error circle reported
in GIN.
