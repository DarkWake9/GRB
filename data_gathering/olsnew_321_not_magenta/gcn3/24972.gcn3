A. Marathe (NITK, IITB), Y. Sharma (IITB), V. Bhalerao (IITB), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 190628B, in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows two pulses of emission with strongest peak at 04:23:39 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 212 cts/s above the background in the combined data of quadrants B, C and D. with a total of 600 cts. Data from quadrant A were excluded from analysis due to noisy pixels. The local mean background count rate was 437 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 12 s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
