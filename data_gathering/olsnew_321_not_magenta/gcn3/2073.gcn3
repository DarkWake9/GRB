A. Pramesh Rao and C. H. Ishwara Chandra (National Centre for Radio
Astrophysics, Pune, India), and D. Bhattacharya (Raman Research
Institute, Bangalore, India) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The GRB030329 was observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(Khodad, India) for 8 hours on 31 March and for 5 hours on 01 April 2003.
The observations were at 1288  MHz with a bandwidth of 8MHz and angular
resolution of ~3.5". There was a detection of emission at the position
of the GRB as shown below

   Date         Time		Flux Density     rms noise

31 March 2003  14-22 UT		245 microJy	35 microJy
01 April 2003  18-22 UT         235 microJy     40 microJy


It is at present unclear whether the detected flux is due to the burst or
due to a background source that may or may not be associated with the
burst.
