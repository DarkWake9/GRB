TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4062
SUBJECT: GRB 051006: XRT position

D. Morris (PSU), C. Pagani (PSU/OAB), M. Capalbi (ASDC), J. Kennea 
(PSU), D. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 051006 (trigger #158593, Norris et 
al., GCN 4061) at 20:32:21 UT, but was unable to obtain an on-board 
centroid. Analysis of the initial ground-processed data finds a faint, 
fading, and uncataloged source at coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 07 23 13.9
Dec(J2000) = +09 30 22.5

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds (90% containment). This 
position lies 118 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 4061.
