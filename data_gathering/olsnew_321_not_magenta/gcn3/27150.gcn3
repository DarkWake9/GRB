R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift GRB 200215A (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA site, on February 16, from 01:37 to 01:46 UT (corresponding to 10.97 to 11.12 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel I filter.

We performed a series of 3x120s exposures. We do not detect any sources in the individual frames (nor in stacked images) in the Swift error region.  Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limit:

I > 18.8
