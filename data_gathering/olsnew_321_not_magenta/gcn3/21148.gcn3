The long GRB 170524B (Swift/BAT detection: Barthelmy et al., GCN 21142)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=38438.475 s UT (10:40:38.475).

The KW light curve shows a multi-peaked emission with a total duration
of ~24 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(5.7 ± 0.4)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 64-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+1.644, of (1.44 ± 0.10)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+21.760 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range by a cutoff power-law
(CPL) function with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.85(-0.06,+0.06),
and the peak energy Ep = 766(-74,+87) keV,
chi2 = 93/98 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep, and an upper limit on beta of -2.5,
chi2 = 93/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate (measured from T0 to T0+5.376 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range by the CPL function
with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.72(-0.06,+0.06),
and the peak energy Ep = 860(-73,+83) keV,
chi2 = 111/98 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep, and an upper limit on beta of -2.7,
chi2 = 110/97 dof.
