Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the XRT position of the GRB080916c (GCN 8261) at 5.5 GHz
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between 14:00:00 UT
and 20:00:00 UT on July 01, 2009.

We did not detect a radio source at the XRT position of the GRB080916c
(GCN 8261). The radio flux density at the afterglow position found out
to be 0.230 +/- 0.180 mJy/beam (1-sigma). The compact array was in its
most compact configuration.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
