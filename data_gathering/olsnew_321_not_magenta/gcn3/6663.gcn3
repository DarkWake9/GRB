Christina C. Thoene (DARK/UC Berkeley), Daniel A. Perley and J. S. Bloom
(UC Berkeley) report:

On 2007 April 15 (UT) we imaged the field of GRB 060814 with Keck I 10m
telescope + LRIS for 750s in I and 840s in V under poor seeing conditions.
The host galaxy reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 5456) and others is
well-detected at a position consistent with the locations of the IR (Levan
et al., GCN 5455) and X-ray (GCN 5451; [1]) transients. A finding chart of
the field can be found at:

We also took spectra of the host galaxy on July 18 with LRIS, using grism
600/4000 and dicroic 560, which covers the wavelength range between 5500
and 9700 AA in the red arm. From the detected [OII] 3729 AA and [OIII]
5008 AA emission lines, we infer a redshift of z=0.84 for the host galaxy.
The second [OIII] line at 4959 is marginally detected whereas H beta lies
in the atmospheric absorption lines and could not be detected.
An image of the 2D spectrum indicating the detected emission lines can be
found at:
