Using the data set from T-239.9 to T+602.1 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070419
(trigger #276212)   (Parsons, et al., GCN Circ. 6305).  The BAT
ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 315.709, -31.266 deg which is
     RA(J2000) = 21h 2m 50.2s
     Dec(J2000) = -31d 15' 58.3"
with an uncertainty of 1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 66%.

The mask-weighted light curve exhibits 4 main peaks at ~T+0 s,T+25s,
T+35s, and T+60s and its duration T90 (15-350 keV) is 236.5 +-12 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from -11.7 to 314.8 s is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.70 +- 0.05. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
7.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-0.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
