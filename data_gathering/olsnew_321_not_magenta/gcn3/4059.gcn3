Swift-BAT triggers 158261 and 158262 Retraction

Beginning at 11:01:44 UT Swift-BAT triggered incorrectly twice
(triggers 158261 and 158262). These are not GRBs and are due
to temporary loss of lock in the star tracker.  Further GCN/Swift  
alerts will be blocked until the star tracker is re-initialized.
