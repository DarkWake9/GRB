We observed the field of GRB 131108A (Racusin et al., GCN 15464,
Vianello et al., GCN 15472 ) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared
Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/11
11.40 to 2013/11 11.53 UTC (61.01 to 64.03 hours after the LAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 2.04 hours exposure in the r and i bands and
0.89 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We continue to detect the previously reported source (Troja et al.,
GCN 15475).  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain
the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

   r    22.4 ± 0.12
   i    22.03 ± 0.11
   Z   21.95 ± 0.22
   Y   21.6 ± 0.3
   J    > 21.5
   H   > 21.0

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. A comparison with our earlier
observations suggests a decay index of approximately -1.6 between our
observations of 2013 Nov 9 and these observations.

Mártir.
