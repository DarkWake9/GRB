TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8407
SUBJECT: Fermi-LAT observation of GRB 081024B 
DATE:    08/10/25 14:07:58 GMT
FROM:    Nicola Omodei at INFN(Pisa)/GLAST  <nicola.omodei@pi.infn.it>

Nicola Omodei (INFN Pisa),
on behalf of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration

The Fermi LAT telescope detected an increased count rate at 2008/10/24 
(21:22:41),
associated with a GRB detected also by the Fermi GBM (Trigger 
number:246576161).
The location of the GRB reported by Fermi LAT data ground analysis is:
Ra=322.9, Dec=21.204
which corresponds to
Ra (J2000) = 21:31:36.00
Dec (J200) = 21:12:14.4
within a statistical uncertainty of 0.16 degrees (68% containment radius).
The emission from this point source was seen up to 3 GeV, in the first 5 
seconds after the trigger.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Nicola Omodei 
(nicola.omodei@pi.infn.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE 
in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan 
and Sweden.
