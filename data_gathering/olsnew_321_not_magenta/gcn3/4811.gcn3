Using the data set from T-299 to T+303 sec from the telemetry
downlinks, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060219
(trigger #191512)  (Moretti, et al., GCN 4788, Barthelmy, et al., GCN 4795).  
The BAT ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 
241.841, 32.305 deg {16h 7m 21.8s, 32d 18' 18.6"} (J2000)
+- 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 67%.

The mask weighted light curve shows four peaks around 
T-55, T-35, T+5 and T+55 sec.  All 4 peaks are ~10 sec in duration. 
No other emission is evident in this full data set.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 
(62 +- 2) sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-57.1 to T+8.2 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 2.6 +- 0.4.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
(4.2 +- 0.8) x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
from T+4.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band is (0.6 +- 0.2) ph/cm2/sec.  
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
