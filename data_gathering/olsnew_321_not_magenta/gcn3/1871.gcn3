Ulysses and HETE-FREGATE  observed this GRB at 61912 seconds (trigger
H2595).  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 40
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 172.120, +41.675 degrees, whose radius is 35.085 +/-  0.173
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
