The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:57:48.50 UT on 25 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220825A (trigger 683085473 / 220825082).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 87.9, Dec = -10.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 52m, -10d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 115.0 degrees.
