The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:12:45 UT on 25 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191125B (trigger 596387570.686402 / 191125634).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 353.5, Dec = 18.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 33m, 18d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
