TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3083
SUBJECT: GRB050309: Early optical limit from P60
DATE:    05/03/10 06:49:44 GMT
FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

Derek B. Fox and S. Bradley Cenko report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Examination of a coadded R-band image from our P60 observations for
the BAT localization region of GRB050309 (Barthelmy et al, GCN 3082),
taken at a mean epoch of 10:55 UT (12 minutes after the burst),
confirms our earlier report (Cenko & Fox, GCN 3080) of the absence of
new optical sources to the limit of the Digitized Sky Survey and our
own observations.  We estimate this limit to be R < 20.5 mag as
calibrated against the USNO B-1.0 catalog magnitudes of bright stars
in the region.

This limit applies to XRT source #2 (GCN 3082), where no emission is
seen.  The position of XRT source #1 is 6-arcsec (twice the FWHM in
our images) from a bright star and USNO B-1.0 catalog object having
R=12.98 mag.  No extension of the catalog star is apparent in our
images."
