SUBJECT: GRB 171102B: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    17/11/02 19:08:46 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1915 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT
images for GRB 171102B, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 288.07787, +22.44433 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 19h 12m 18.69s
Dec (J2000): +22d 26' 39.6"

with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
