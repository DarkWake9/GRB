SUBJECT: GRB 080602: NOT R-band upper limit

Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Pierre-Olivier Quirion (Univ. AArhus), and
Johan Peter Uldall Fynbo (DARK/NBI), Páll Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 080602 (Beardmore et al., GCN 7781) with the
NOT telescope. Observations were carried out in the R band at high airmass
(~6) and close to twilight. Mean time was June 2.203 UT, 3.4 hr after the
trigger. Inside the refined XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 7782),
we do not detect any source down to a limiting magnitude R=22.3.
Observations will be attempted with the VLT on Cerro Paranal, but due to
weather the outlook for data is bad. We encourage observations from other
sites.
