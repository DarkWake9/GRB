V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) & J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC)  
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 140621A on 2014-06-23 at  
21:01:54 UT, 177 ks after the IPN trigger (Golenetskii et al. GCN Circ  
16444, 16445; Younes & Meegan, GCN Circ 16447). An observation  
centered on RA, Dec: 25.0642, 22.4111 has been secured.

In the 4 ks exposure covering 60% of the IPN box that remained after  
the BAT non-detection exclusion, we do not find any new X-ray source,  
down to a three sigma upper limit of 3.05E-03 cts/s.

This circular is an official product of the Swift/XRT team.
