We observed the field of GRB 070223 (GCN 6125) with CCD detector
at our 1.02 meter telescope of the Yunnan observatory, Kunming, 
China. We started our observation on Feb. 23, 2006 at UT 13:21:20.
We took 5 image frames of 200 seconds exposure time of each in
the optical R passband. There is no detection of optical afterglow
candidate in our combined 5 images. The 5-sigma limiting magnitude
of our observations is R ~ 20.0 mag.
