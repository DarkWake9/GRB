J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 11:10:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160220B (trigger=674734). Swift did not slew immediately
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 259.854, -18.123 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 19m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = -18d 07' 22"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+46.5
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. R. Cummings (jayc AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
