TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1547
SUBJECT: IPN annulus for GRB020914B

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 16810 s.  A preliminary
analysis of the Konus data indicates that it arrived from an ecliptic
latitude between -5 and +5 degrees.  More Konus data should be obtained
within 72 hours which will allow us to derive a triangulation annulus
for this event, and a GCN message will be issued.  Information on the
burst intensity and duration will also be given at that time.  As
Mars Odyssey did not observe this burst, it will not be possible to
derive a small error box for it.
