We observed the possible OT in PGC 094244 (GCN #24470, Lipunov et al.) at
2019-05-11 12:50:12 UT using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan.
We obtained g-, r-, i-band images with 300s exposure time, and the
transient is not detected in all images. The r-band limiting magnitude is
about 21 by comparing with Pan-STARRS images. This is consistent with the
results of Tucker et al. (GCN #24477).

We thank the staff in Lulin Observatory for helping the observations.
