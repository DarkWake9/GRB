Alessandra Corsi (Texas Tech University) report:

We observed GRB 171205A (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 22177) with the Giant 
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2017 Dec 10.07 UT at 1400 MHz band. 
Our preliminary analysis results in a non-detection. The 3-sigma upper 
limit on the GRB position (Laskar et al.  GCN 22216) is 180 uJy. This 
could be because the radio emission may be absorbed at low frequencies.
More detailed analysis of the data is in progress.

More observations are planned. We thank the GMRT staff to schedule the 
observations.
