K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Despite the extraneous text in GCN 1543 (caused by the fact that it was
sent while I was on travel and working from an unfamiliar terminal,
apologies for the confusion) the numbers given for the annulus center
and radius were correct.  The message is repeated below for clarity,
with some additional information.

Ulysses and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at 78798 seconds.  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration ~8 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
8x10^-7 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 6.7x10^-7 erg/cm2.
We have triangulated it to an annulus with radius 39.932 +/- 0.066
degrees (3 sigma) centered at RA, Decl (2000) 170.909, +39.244 degrees.
In addition, a preliminary analysis of the Konus ecliptic latitude
response indicates that this event came from above ecliptic latitude
+30 degrees.  The small circle which describes this ecliptic latitude
intersects the annulus at approximately RA, Decl (2000)=211.4, +19.4
degrees and at 115.0, +51.9 degrees.

Mars Odysssey did not detect this burst, so it will not be possible
to derive a true error box for it.  However, some improvements
in the triangulation and ecliptic latitude are possible.
