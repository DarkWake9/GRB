and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 190504A has been detected
by Fermi (GBM trigger 578679393) and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far,
at about 58588 s UT (16:16:28).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=282.762 deg (18h 51m 03s) Dec(2000)=+33.543 deg (+33d 32' 34"),
whose radius is 87.799 +/- 10.241 deg (3 sigma).

The annulus is inconsistent with the high-energy neutrino candidate
event IceCube-190503A (IceCube Collaboration GCN Circ. 24378).

This annulus may be improved.
