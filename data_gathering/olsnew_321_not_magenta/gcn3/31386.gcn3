We observed the field of GRB 211227A (Beardmore et al., GCN #31316)
with the Lijiang 2.4m telescope on January 3, 2022，starting at 18:23:25 UT，
about 6.8 day after trigger. The observations were performed in R band 
with a total exposure of 1200 s at airmass of 1.2 and a seeing of ~1.7, 
under good weather conditions.

Within the XRT enhanced errorbox (Goad et al., GCN #31322), we did not
detect any source to a depth of R &gt; 21.5 mag calibrated by nearby 
SDSS DR12 stars (SDSS J084838.92-024405.9，J084838.22-024355.7， 
J084836.33-024403.8). This is consistent with other non-detections 
reported (Lipunov et al., GCN #31315; Hu et al., GCN #31318; 
Fu et al., GCN #31320; Strausbaugh et al.,GCN #31321; Perley, GCN #31323;
Malesani et al., GCN #31324; Belles et al., GCN #31328, 
Kann et al., GCN #31341,GCN #31376 O'Connor et al.). 

We thank the staff of the Lijiang 2.4m telescope, 
in particular Jiangguo Wang for scheduling of these observations.
