P. D'Avanzo, S. Campana, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of  the
Swift team:

We have analysed 1.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 130216B (Cummings GCN Circ.
14226; Chaplin GCN Circ. 14235), from 247.9 ks to 277.3 ks after the BAT
trigger. The data are all in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No bright X-ray
afterglow is detected inside the refined BAT error circle (Cummings et al.
GCN Circ. 14232). The 3sigma upper limit is of 9.3 x 10^-3 cts/s.

This corresponds to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.6 x 10^-13 erg/cm2/s
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum with photon spectral index of 2). If we
consider the Galactic absorption in this direction (1.3 x 10^21 cm^-2;
Kalberla et al. 2005) this corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 4.7 x
10^-13 erg/cm2/s.

We note that there is a flux excess (SNR~2) at the edge (but inside) of
the 1.5 arcmin radius BAT error circle, at the following position: RA,
Dec=58.84993, +2.05183 which is equivalent to

RA (J2000): 03h 55m 23.98s
Dec (J2000): +02d 03' 06.6"

with an uncertainty of 8.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The count rate
at this position is (2.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^-3 cts/s.
