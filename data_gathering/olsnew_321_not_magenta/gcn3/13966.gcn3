R. Chornock, E. Berger, W. Fong, D. Milisavljevic, and M. Drout 
(Harvard) report:

We observed the error circle of Swift trigger number 538575 with IMACS 
on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope starting on 2012 November 16.137 
UT (50 min after the trigger).  In a single 180-sec r-band image we do 
not detect any new sources in comparison with the DSS to the depth of 
the survey image.  Additional analysis is in progress.
