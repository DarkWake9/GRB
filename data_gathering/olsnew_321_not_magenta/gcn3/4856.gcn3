report:

Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, RHESSI, Suzaku-WAM, and Swift-BAT observed 
a bright short hard GRB at about 22:42:47 UT on March 3.
The burst was outside of the field of view of Swift-BAT, so it was not
imaged. Ulysses was off, and Odyssey did not observe this event.

We have derived a triangulation annulus centered at
RA(2000), Dec(2000) = 42.325 deg,  +16.869 deg,
whose radius is 73.266 ±0.173 deg (3 sigma).
Combining the all available data we have triangulated the GRB to
the section of this annulus between
RA(2000), Dec(2000)= 221, +26 and 230, +71 degrees.

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~0.6 s,
fluence 1.16(-0.20,+0.19)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.206 s
4.27(-1.11,+1.08)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The spectrum integrated over the most intense part of the burst
(accumulated from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is well fitted in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.35(-0.16, +0.18),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.51(-2.32, +0.48),
the break E0 = 702(-232, +256) keV (chi2 = 52/41 dof).
The peak energy Epeak = 1158(-281, +305) keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
