The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:


On 2022-05-24 at 07:41:32.185 UT IceCube detected a track-like event 
with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin.


The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream. 
The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This 
alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 2.8556 events per year due to 
atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating 
state at the time of detection.


After the initial automated alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136662_35405932.amon), 
moreÂ sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, 
with the direction refined to:


Date: 2022-05-24

Time: 07:41:32.185 UT

RA: +47.20 (+4.21/-2.51 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

Dec: -3.28 (+0.77/-0.89 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000


We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help 
identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.


There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty 
region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL 
J0307.8-0419 at RA: +46.95 deg, Dec: -4.33 deg (2.06 deg away from the 
best-fit event position).


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
