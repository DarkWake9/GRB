D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA) and J.L. Racusin report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 170202A (Racusin et al. GCN
Circ. 20575), from 64 s to 40.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 131 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et
al. (GCN Circ. 20586).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=2.9 (+3.3, -0.6). At T+84.5 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of -1.5 (+0.0, -2.0). The light curve breaks again
at T+95.5 s to a decay with alpha=3.15 (+0.19, -0.17),	and  again at
T+314 s s to alpha=0.01 (+0.17, -0.18),  before a final break at T+2223
s s after which the decay index is 1.08 (+0.12, -0.17).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.94 (+0.09, -0.08). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.7 (+6.4, -3.7) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 3.645, in addition to the Galactic value of 2.0 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index
of 2.00 (+0.13, -0.12) and a best-fitting absorption column of 5.2
(+8.8, -5.2) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10
keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11
(3.5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 2.0 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    5.2 (+8.8, -5.2) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=3.645
Photon index:	     2.00 (+0.13, -0.12)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.08, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.018 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.9 x
10^-13 (6.4 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
