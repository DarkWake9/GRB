A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the CARMA Key 
Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 120923A (Yershov et al; GCN 13796) with 
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) 
beginning on 2012 Sep 23.99 UT (0.77 d after the burst).  Observations 
were obtained at a mean frequency of ~85 GHz.  We find no significant 
millimeter emission at the position of the near-IR counterpart (Levan et 
al; GCN 13802) or within the enhanced Swift/XRT error circle (Goad et 
al; GCN 13801) to a preliminary 3-sigma limit of 0.39 mJy."
