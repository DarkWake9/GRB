K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 "The error region of the Swift short hard GRB 050509b (Hurkett et al. 
GCN 3381; Barthelmy et al. GCN 3385) was imaged with the 0.3 m
telescope in the New Mexico Skies observatory.  The observation
started at 2005 May 9, 04:08:52 UT (513 s after the trigger) and 120 s
integrations in I and V bands were obtained.

 The optical counterpart candidate (Bloom et al. GCN 3388; Cenko et
al. GCN 3391) of the XRT source (Kennea et al. GCN 3383) is not
detected in our frames while the candidate host galaxy is
detected. The plate scale of our images is 1".41/pixel and the optical
counterpart candidate should be readily resolved from the galaxy.

 We therefore derive the following 3 sigma upper limits for the
optical counterpart candidate (GCN 3388; GCN 3391) relative to
USNO-B1.0 I magnitude.
