Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160203A (trigger #672525)
(D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 18979).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 161.967, -24.772 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 47m 52.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -24d 46' 17.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 20%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-1 sec,
peaking at ~T+13 sec, and ending at ~T+40 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
20.2 +- 3.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+1.46 to T+25.78 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.93 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.98 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
