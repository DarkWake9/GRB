The long GRB 071010 (Swift-BAT trigger #293795:
Markwardt et al., GCN 6871, 6877) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=74748.490 s UT (20:45:48.490).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration of ~15 s, followed by a weak soft tail
seen up to T-T0 ~50 s.
There is a hint of the pretrigger pulse detected by BAT
(Markwardt et al., GCN 6877) in the Konus-Wind
soft energy band (18-70 keV).
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 4.78(-3.12, +0.95)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+1.6 s
of 8.92(-5.99, +2.29)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+16.640 s) can be fitted
(in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha =  -1.25 (-0.49, +0.74),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.65(-0.49, +0.29),
the peak energy Ep = 52 (-14, +10) keV (chi2 = 69.1/55 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
