C. Guidorzi, R. Martone (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C.G. Mundell 
(U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Cucchiara, 
D. Morris (U. of Virgin Islands) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

We automatically observed Swift GRB 181003A (Beardmore et al. GCN 23295) 
with one LCO 1-m unit at Cerro Tololo from October 03, 05:26:07 UT 
(corresponding to 15 minutes from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS r' 
filter. Within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN 23296) we 
marginally detect an uncatalogued source with r'=22.11 +- 0.25 mag from 
a 9x60s exposure at a mid time of 0.35 hours post GRB, as calibrated 
against nearby Pan-STARRS objects, at the following position:

RA(J2000) =  03:30:06.86
DEC(J2000)= -33:57:54.2

with an error radius of about 1".
