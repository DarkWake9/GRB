U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri 
report:

Photometric optical measurements of GRB 130418A detected by SWIFT trigger 553847 
(de Pasquale et al. 2013; GCN Circ. 14377) have been done using the Schmidt 
telescope 0.32m F/3.1 and Starlight CCD camera HX-516 applied at direct focus. 
120 sec. exposure time and 2x2 binning were used for all photos. 
All exposure were unfiltered. 
Flat field and dark have been captured and all images were corrected with them. 
Astrometrica software version 4.6.5.390 was used to perform differential photometry on 
the reduced images. 

began of period: 2013/04/18.80415 -  17 min after  the burst.
end   of period: 2013/04/18.92338 - 188 min after  the burst.
