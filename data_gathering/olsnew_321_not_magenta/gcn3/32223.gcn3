C. Gronwall (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 20:26:02 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
a marginal-significance peak in a 1 minute survey image (trigger=1110865). 
Swift could not slew to the location due to a Sun angle constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 103.793, -1.531 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 55m 10s
   Dec(J2000) = -01d 31' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger,
the immediately available BAT light curve does not show any significant
variation. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 17:56 UT on 2022 August 19. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Due to the marginal significance of the original detection
(7.5 sigma in on-board imaging, and no significant peak found in
ground-based re-analysis), and the lack of a BAT rate increase,
we believe that this image peak is not due to an astrophysical
event.  Further analysis of full data set after downlink will
clarify the reality of this event.
