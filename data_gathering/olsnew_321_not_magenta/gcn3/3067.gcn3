on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the 8 arcsecond position of the uncataloged x-ray source found
by the Swift XRT instrument (Giommi et al., GCN 3054) in the field of GRB
050223 with three telescopes of the PROMPT robotic telescope array located
at CTIO.  Manual observations first began in V 2.5 hours after the burst at
high airmass and no new sources were observed to the limiting magnitude of
a single exposure.  Observations continued in Rc and Ic and details are
given below.

times are given in hours after the burst (03:09:06 UT).

Limiting magnitudes were calculated using 2 NOMAD stars for V, and 5
USNO-B1.0 stars for Ic and Rc.

An overview of PROMPT can be found at astro-ph/0502429.  The project is
still in the building/commissioning phase with only three telescopes
currently online.
