T.P. Roberts, K. Page, A. Beardmore (U. Leicester), J.L. Racusin,
J.A. Kennea (PSU), N. White (GSFC), D. Hinshaw (GSFC-SPSYS) report on
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have re-analysed the complete Swift dataset from the TOO
observation of the INTEGRAL-detected GRB050714a (see GCN circ. 3610),
beginning 13.7 hours after the burst.  The new refined coordinates of
the afterglow candidate are:

RA(J2000) = 02 54 22.2
Dec(J2000) = +69 06 46

We estimate an uncertainty of 6.9 arcseconds on this position (90%
containment).  However, we were unable establish from this data whether
the source was definitely fading due its low count rate.

Swift began a second observation of this GRB at 00:05 UT on 19th July
2005 (5.0 days since the burst event).  In 9.7 ks of data we do not
detect the candidate afterglow.  Hence we confirm that the behaviour
of the X-ray source identified in our first circular is consistent
with it being the afterglow of GRB 050714a.
