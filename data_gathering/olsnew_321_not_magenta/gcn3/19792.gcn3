The short-duration GRB 160804B (Fermi-GBM trigger #491977127)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 04:18:42.78
on 4 August 2016.  The burst signal was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows two short spikes.  The first peak starts
at T+0.4 s, peaks at T+0.45 s and ends at T+0.7 s.  The second spike
peaks at T+0.8 s with a duration of 0.1 s.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 0.41 +- 0.04 sec (100-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
