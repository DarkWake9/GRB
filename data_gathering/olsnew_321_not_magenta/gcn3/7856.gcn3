R. Chornock, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report:

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory responded to 
the Swift alert for GRB 080607 (Mangano et al., GCN 7847) and detected the 
optical afterglow previously announced by several other teams (Rujopakarn et 
al., GCN 7846; Mangano et al., GCN 7847; Updike et al., GCN 7848; Prochaska et 
al., GCN 7849; Miller et al., GCN 7850).

KAIT took a series of V, I, and unfiltered images starting at 06:09:25 (UT), 
118s after the BAT trigger.  The KAIT position is:
   (J2000) 12:59:47.22  +15:55:11.0

The preliminary unfiltered light curve shows a power-law decay from magnitude 
17.60 at t=188s with a decay index of alpha = -1.27 +/- 0.09.
