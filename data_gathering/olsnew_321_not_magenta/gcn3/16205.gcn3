"We observed the field of GRB 140430A (Siegel et  al. GCN 16190) with the 0.82m IAC80 telescope located at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. The observations were carried on April 30.87401-30.88509 UT (25.0-40.9 min post burst) using the BVR-band filters. The optical afterglow is clearly detected in the three bands with a preliminary Vega magnitude of B=19.3 against the USNO B1.0 catalogue."
