report:

The afterglow of the HETE burst (H10893) GRB 030226 (Fox et al., GCN 1879;
Price et al., GCN 1880) was observed with the VLT Yepun and the FORS2 
spectrograph, equipped with the 300V grism on Feb. 26, beginning at 08:52 UT. 
The total exposure time was 15 min. In the calibrated spectrum, covering 
the 360-900 nm region, we clearly identify two distinct absorption-line 
systems of Fe II (160.8), Al II (167.1) and CIV (154.8) at redshifts 
z=1.962+/-0.001 and 1.986+/-0.001, improving earlier findings 
(Ando et al., GCN 1884). We conclude that the redshift of the burster 
is z=1.986+/-0.001 or larger.

We are grateful for the assistence of the staff at Paranal.
