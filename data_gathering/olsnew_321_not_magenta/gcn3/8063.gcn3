"Pi of the Sky" apparatus observed the position of GRB080805. Three 10s
images of this field have been taken at 07:37:45 - 07:38:42 ( 3 minutes
before the GRB). No new object is seen within the error box and the limit
is 12.5 magnitudo.

After receiving the trigger from SWIFT, the field was observed 84s after
the GRB. No new object has been found within the Swift-BAT error box.
The limiting magnitude (unfiltered) on single 10s exposures is :

         07:42:58 - 07:43:08 - 12.2 mag
         07:43:11 - 07:43:21 - 12.2 mag
         07:43:24 - 07:43:34 - 12.2 mag

  and 12.5 mag on 20 coadded images.
