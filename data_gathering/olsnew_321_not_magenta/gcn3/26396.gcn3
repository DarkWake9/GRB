We realised that the text of GCN 26390 was submitted while still incomplete. The correct text is the following:

We report the results of the observation of the field of the gravitational wave event S191204r (GCN 26334) obtained with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) equipped with Omegacam (described in GCN 26334, Proposal ID ESO 0104.D-0049). Images were analised using our image difference pipelines (Brocato et al. 2018 MNRAS, 474,1). As reference images we used DECAM archive images retrieced from https://datalab.noao.edu/sia/des_dr1 <https://datalab.noao.edu/sia/des_dr1>. The final vetting was done via visual inspection. We detected the following three interesting candidates:

Name    |  RA   |  Dec   |   MJD   |   Mag 
VSTJ044435.43-332755.7 | 04:44:35.432 | -33:27:55.69 | 58222.081 | 21.5 +/- 0.1
VSTJ051111.58-373132.0  | 05:11:11.576 | -37:31:32.04 | 58822.079 | 20.6 +/- 0.1
VSTJ051052.17-335413.9 | 05:10:52.168 | -33:54:13.95 | 58823.140 | 22.2 +/- 0.2

The transients were detected at multiple epochs. Here we report epoch and magnitude for the brightest detection. All the transients appear projected near a galaxy. In particular VSTJ051111.58-373132.0 is located 7.4 arcsec from the nucleus of GLADE131392 which distance is 178Mpc (GLADE catalog). The small distance appears to exclude that this transient is related to the GW event.

For the other two galaxies the distance is unknown. In the next days, a fourth observation epoch with the VST is scheduled to check for the transient luminosity evolution.

We apologise for any confusion.
