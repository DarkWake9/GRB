The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:48:20 UT on 15 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210415A (trigger 640162105.095184 / 210415284).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 130.3, Dec = -37.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 41m, -37d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 37.0 degrees.
