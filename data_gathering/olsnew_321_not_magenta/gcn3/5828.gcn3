M. Uemura, A. Arai, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.), 
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We started optical imaging of the field of GRB061121 using 
the TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima 
Observatory, Japan.  We detected the optical afterglow reported 
in GCN 5823 and 5824 in our images taken with the exposure time of 
123 s and the Rc filter.  Using the comparison star USNOA2.0 
0750-0732588 assuming Rc=14.2, our preliminary analysis yielded 
the following photometric result:

UT            Time after the burst (s)    Rc mag  
Nov. 21.71928         6797                18.539 +/- 0.074                                    

We keep time-series observations.
