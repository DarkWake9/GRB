report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2018-12-25T11:44:10.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181225A (trigger ID: HEB181225489) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by by AGILE/MCAL (A. Ursi et al.,GCN23560)„ÄÅ
Fermi/LAT (M. Arimoto et al., GCN23561) and Fermi/GBM (S.Poolakkil., GCN23562).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 1.23 s measured from T0+0.46 s. 
The 50-ms peak rate, measured from T0+1.208 s, is 2963.2 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst 2350.8 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
GRB mode with the energy range of about 200-3000 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
