At 12:52:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050117.  The spacecraft autonomously slewed
to the burst for the first time with a real GRB.

The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 358.427,+65.945 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a systematic
uncertainty).  This is within 55 arcsec of the XRT position (Burrows et al.,
GCN Circ 2951).  This burst occurred while Swift was near the SAA.
The lightcurve is multi-peaked with a duration of ~200 sec.  We note that
the XRT was on target during the later portion of the gamma-ray phase
of the burst.
