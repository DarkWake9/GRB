K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of GRB 060204B (Falcone et al. GCN 4655) was imaged
with the 0.35m ART 3b telescope in Toyonaka, Osaka.

 From a stacked frame (60s x 20 in Ic), the following 3 sigma limit is
derived for an optical counterpart of the XRT source (GCN 4655), with
reference to USNO-B1.0 I magnitude.
