G.G.Williams (Steward Observatory), C.Blake (CalTech/Princeton),
Dieter Hartmann (Clemson), and the S-LOTIS
collaboration report:

The error box of GRB020813 (HETE Trigger 2262, GCN 1471) was observed
in R band with the 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope, located at Kitt Peak,
beginning at 4.42 UT on August 13, 2002.  In total, 110 individual 60s
images were taken.  By coadding the first 9 images, taken between 4.42
and 4.62 UT, the OT reported by Fox et al. (GCN 1470) was detected at
the 3 sigma level.  This represents the earliest detection of the OT
through a standard photometric filter.  Using F band photographic
magnitudes from the GSC2.2, the magnitude of the OT was determined by
comparison to several nearby stars.  We report an R band magnitude of
18.38+/-0.38 at UT 4.51.  This magnitude is consistent with a decay
slope of approximately -1 to the later-time R band data reported by
Masi (GCN 1484), Urata et al. (GCN 1485), and Kiziloglu et al. (GCN
1488).  Analysis of the rest of the S-LOTIS data is in progress.
