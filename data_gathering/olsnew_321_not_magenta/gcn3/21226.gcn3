We previously reported on the online track-like neutrino search for LIGO-Virgo trigger G288732. We are updating this result with adopting a new online configuration, which enables better background rejection online, allowing for an increased rate of events passing the neutrino track event selection, along a higher efficiency for neutrino events. With this online search, the expected background neutrino rate is ~6 within our [-500,500] time window.

We searched IceCube online track-like neutrino candidates (GFU) detected in a [-500,500] second interval about the LIGO-Virgo trigger G288732. We compared the candidate source directions of 7 temporally-coincident neutrinos to the BAYESTAR skymap, with the following parameters:

The analysis found NO COINCIDENT ONLINE TRACK-LIKE NEUTRINO CANDIDATES detected by IceCube within the 500 second window surrounding G288732 within the BAYESTAR skymap.

A coincident neutrino-GW skymap has been posted to GraceDB (<https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G288732/files/coinc_skymap_initial_icecube.png,2>). A JSON-formatted list of the above neutrinos can be downloaded from GraceDB at:<https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G288732/files/IceCubeNeutrinoList.json,3>

In addition, we are performing coincident searches with other IceCube data streams, including the high-energy starting events (HESE) and Supernova triggers.  HESE events have typical energies > 60 TeV and start inside the detector volume, leading to a relatively pure event sample with a high fraction of astrophysical neutrinos.  The SN trigger system is sensitive to sudden increases in photomultiplier counts across the detector, which could indicate a burst of MeV neutrinos.  We will submit separate GCN circulars if coincident HESE or SN triggers are found.
