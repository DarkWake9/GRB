SGR 1806-20: Further low frequency GMRT results

P. Chandra on behalf of GMRT observatory reports the detection of
 radio emission from the SGR 1806-20 with the Giant Metrewave
 Radio Telescope (GMRT) in the 610 MHz band (with resolution 6-10")
on the  following dates:

 608 MHz:
 6 Jan 2005     111.8 (6.6) mJy
 7 Jan 2005     98.8 (29.3) mJy
 8 Jan 2005     83.8 (9.2) mJy
 9 Jan 2005     74.3 (14.5) mJy

The values quoted here are after subtracting the extended emission
contribution from the SGR and doing the Tsys corection by a factor of 1.8.

The modified value of 608 MHz flux density on 4 Jan 2005 observation is
231.7 (16.7) mJy (uncorrected value 199 mJy in reported in GCN 2939).
This new value is after subtracting the extended emission from the
 SGR and modified with Tsys correction factor of 1.8.

We shall report separately the 235 MHz band fluxes of SGR 1806-20
on these days (including 4 Jan 2005 observations (reported in GCN 2939))
treated similarly.
