The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and Virgo Observatory
(V1) around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S190924h
(GCN Circular 25829). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via
GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190924h

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. The 90%
credible region is 303 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 548 +/- 112 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this
alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide <

[GCN OPS NOTE(02oct19): Please note, see Circ 25909 for a reissue
of this Circ with the correction made.  And after that reissue,
GCN OPS has changed this archive copy of 25905's Subject-line
from "S190828j" to "S190828h".]
