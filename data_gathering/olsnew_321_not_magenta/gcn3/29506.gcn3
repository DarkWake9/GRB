The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 13 Feb 2021 at 18:40:24.51UT IceCube issued an alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134994_1103075.amon) 
reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of astrophysical origin. Upon further examination by the IceCube collaboration, the event  was found to clearly not be of astrophysical origin.  

At the time of this alert, the detector was operating with several portions of the detector removed from data taking.  Normally, these periods of operation are excluded from generating alerts.  We are investigating why this took place.  

We apologize for any confusion this error may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
