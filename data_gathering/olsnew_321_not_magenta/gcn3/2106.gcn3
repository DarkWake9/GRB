"We have observed the optical afterglow (Peterson and Price GCN1985)
of GRB030329 on the nights of 2003 March 29 and April 1 using the Kiso
observatory (the University of Tokyo) 105 cm Schmidt telescope with B
and R band filters. Our observations started at March 29 13:21:26 (1.8
hour after the burst). 

We have measured the B and R band magnitude using field photometry
(Henden GCN2082). The results are listed below. 
 The observations and more accurate photometry are in progress.
