E. Troja (NASA/GSFC/UMCP), C. Gronwall (PSU),
K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) report on behalf of the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 07:40:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220302A (trigger=1094950).  Swift did not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 301.432, +49.389 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 05m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = +49d 23' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1156 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Swift is currently restarting after a reaction wheel failure, so
automatic slews to GRBs are turned off.  Therefore there will be
no XRT or UVOT observations at this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (nora.gsfc AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
