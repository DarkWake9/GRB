of the Swift Team:

At 06:53:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a short soft burst (trigger=214277).  Swift slewed immediately 
to the source. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 286.791, +9.323 {19h 07m 10s, +09d 19' 22"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single weak peak 
with a duration of < 0.032 sec.  The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec 
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

As stated in the GCN Notice corresponding to this trigger, the source is
coincident with SGR 1900+14. The short, soft emission is completely
consistent with the previous characteristics of the SGR.  This is the 
first BAT onboard detection of this source since 2006-04-14.

The XRT began taking data at 06:54:50 UT, 110 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  XRT PC data of the first orbit (exposure 2264.7 s) shows
a source at the SGR position with a constant rate of (5.8+/-0.5)E-2 c/s 
consistent with the quiescent state of the source. The source rate
corresponds to an unabsorbed (0.2-10 keV) flux of 
(2.0+/-0.2)E-11 erg cm**-2 s**-1.
