The long GRB 080507 localized by SuperAGILE (Lapshov et al., GCN
7697) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=27902.194 s UT (07:45:02.194).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 5.09(-0.24, +0.26)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+4.960 s
of (3.07 +/- 0.44)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+47.616 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV-2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -0.88 +/- 0.06,
and Ep = 423(-33, +38) keV (chi2 = 55.0/61 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.85 +/- 0.07,
the high energy photon index beta < -2.34,
the peak energy Ep =  399(-32, +42) keV (chi2 = 54.6/60 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
