K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 37179 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   0.2
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.2E-07 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.
Its duration and spectrum place it in the "short/hard" burst category.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
whose approximate area is  11. sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
