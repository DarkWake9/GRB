"GRB010412 was triggered by the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM)
on April 12.907280 U.T and was also detected by the Wide Field
Camera (WFC) unit 1 onboard the same satellite.  A preliminary analysis of
the GRBM data shows a very complex, multi-pulse time profile.  The
duration is about 75 s and the peak count rate 1896 +/- 59 cts/s,
corresponding to a 1 s peak flux of (1.71 +/- 0.06) x 10^(-6) erg/cm2/s
in the 40-700 keV energy band.  The WFC data show a duration of about 90 s
and a peak flux of 2.3 Crab (2-28  keV).  The position of the X-ray
counterpart is R.A.= 19h 39m 39.0s, Decl.=+13d 37'06.6' (equinox 2000.0)
with an error radius of 6', that includes uncertainties due to a
non-optimum attitude control configuration.  No follow-up observation with
the BeppoSAX NFI was scheduled, due to an on-going other TOO."
