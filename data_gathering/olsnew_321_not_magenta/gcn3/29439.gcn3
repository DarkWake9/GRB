Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia, M. A. Castro Tirado (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga), R. Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC) and M. Jelinek (ASU-CAS), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 210208A by INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al. GCNC 29429), the 60 cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) pointed to the position of the GRB, 17 deg away from the Galactic Center. No new source within the INTEGRAL/IBIS error box down to 17.3 mag is detected in the co-added image (2x60 s exposures, clear filter) obtained through a partially cloudy sky, at 06:17 UT on Feb 9 (~17.25 hr after trigger).

We thank the staff at La Mayora for their excellent support.
