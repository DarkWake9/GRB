The long GRB 200122A (Swift detection:  Sonbas et al., GCN 26844)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=6066.859 s UT (01:41:06.859).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
in the interval from ~T0-12 s to ~T0+26 s.
The total duration of the burst is ~40 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB200122_T06066/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a fluence of (2.0 ± 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm^2 and
a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+6.080,
of (5.7 ± 0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm^2/s (both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+24.832 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 20 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.00 (-0.13,+0.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.81 (-0.94,+0.32),
the peak energy Ep = 148 (-16,+15) keV,
chi2 = 83/96 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate (measured from T0
to T0+8.448 s) is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.88 (-0.16,+0.19),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.37 (-0.39,+0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 168 (-22,+31) keV,
chi2 = 83/96 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 68% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
