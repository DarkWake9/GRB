SUBJECT: GRB 080307: Gemini-N i-band observations - candidate afterglow

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the field of GRB 080307 with Gemini-N/GMOS, beginning
at 12:50 (UT), approximately 85 minutes post-burst.  We detect a
point source in the i-band image within the XRT error circle (GCN 7366)
with (J2000) coordinates:

 09 06 30.78  +35 08 20.0

Provisional photometry relative to field SDSS stars gives a magnitude
of i=22.4 at this time.

We thank the Gemini staff, particularly Ricardo Schiavon, for
support in obtaining these observations.
