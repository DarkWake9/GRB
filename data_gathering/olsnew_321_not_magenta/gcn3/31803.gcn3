The bright, long-duration GRB 220320A (AstroSat-CZTI detection: 
Gopalakrishnan et al., GCN Circ. 31779; localized by IPN: Kozyrev et al. 
GCN Circ. 31783 and detected also by Fermi/GBM trigger 669443999, 
CALET/CGBM trigger 1331786356, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS at about 
04:39:54 UT) was also detected by one of the two GRB detectors on board 
of the VZLUSAT-2 3U CubeSat (https://www.vzlusat2.cz/en/).

This is the first time that a GRB was observed by the VZLUSAT-2 3U CubeSat.

The data acquisition was performed by GRB detector unit no. 1 (the unit 
no. 0 was turned off). The detector was performing a several hours long 
background monitoring survey with 15 s temporal resolution, which is not 
optimal for GRB search. Much finer resolution is planned for the nominal 
operation. The 46 sigma detection significance was confirmed at around 
04:39:55 UTC.

The light curve obtained by VZLUSAT-2 is available here:

GRB detectors on VZLUSAT-2 are a demonstration payload for a future 
CubeSats constellation (Werner et al. Proc. SPIE 2018). Two GRB modules 
of VZLUSAT-2 are placed in a perpendicular manner and each consists of a 
75 x 75 x 5 mm3 CsI scintillator read out by a SiPM array, covering the 
energy range from ~30 keV to ~1000 keV. VZLUSAT-2 was launched on 2022 
January 13 from Cape Canaveral.
