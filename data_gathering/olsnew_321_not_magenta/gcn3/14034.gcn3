M. H. Siegel (PSU) and S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 121202A
2828 s after the BAT trigger (Oates et al., GCN Circ 14032).  UVOT took a 
finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter. No credible afterglow
candidate has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image
covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been
about 19.6 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board
covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to
about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.05.
