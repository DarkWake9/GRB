IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

A search for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent
with the sky
localization of gravitational-wave candidate S190728q in a time range of
1000 seconds [1]
centered on the alert event time (2019-07-28 06:36:50.529 UTC to 2019-07-28
06:53:30.529 UTC)
has been performed. During this time period IceCube was collecting good
quality data.
The search is a maximum likelihood analysis which searches for a generic
point-like neutrino
 source coincident with the given GW skymap [2].

One track-like event is found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the
gravitational-wave
candidate S190728q calculated from the map circulated in the 4-Initial
notice. This
represents an overall p-value of 0.03 (1.84 sigma).

An earlier search (GCN 25185) based on preliminary information of S190728q
yielded no significant
p-values for the worse GW localization [3].


Properties of the coincident events are shown below.

     0.039


where:
dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger.
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a
circle
representing 90% CL containment by area.
p-value = the p-value for this specific track event
RA & Dec = Right ascension and declination in degrees quoted in J2000 epoch

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the
geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of
contact can be
reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
