We observed the field of GRB 150212A (Page, et al., GCN 17449) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/02 12.51 to 2015/02 12.55 UTC (1.29 to
2.31 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.89 hours exposure
in the r, i, and z bands.

We find one uncatalogued source within the Swift XRT error circle (Evans,
et al., GCN 17452) at a position RA, Dec = 285.48273,  47.36637 (+/- 0.5",
J2000) with magnitudes r = 23.1 +/- 0.4 and i = 21.4 +/- 0.1.  This source
does not appear to fade in time during our observation.  For other
potential sources within the XRT error circle, in comparison with USNO-B1
and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 23.1
  i > 23.3
  z > 19.6

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
