S.A. Yost (U Mich), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), F. Yuan (U Mich), 
report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded 
to GRB 061121 (Swift trigger 239899). The first image was at 15:22:49.6 
UT, 20.6 s after the burst (7.6 s after the GCN notice time). The 
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 14.9 
magnitude, fading source with coordinates:

      09:48:54.4      -13:11:42.2    (J2000), with positional 
uncertainty of 1" or better.

This is coincident with the UVOT source (GCN 5823)
