The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:18:33 UT on 7 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200407B (trigger 607943918.47521 / 200407388).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 182.0, Dec = 35.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 07m, 35d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
