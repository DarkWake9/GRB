The long-duration GRB 140102A
(Swift-BAT trigger 582760: Hagen et al., GCN 15653, Barthelmy et al., GCN 15662;
Fermi LAT detection: Sonbas et al., GCN 15659;
MAXI/GCS detection: Kimura at al., GCN 15663)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=76656.245 s UT (21:17:36.245).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure from ~T0-0.5 s to ~T0+4 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140102_T76656/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (2.0 ± 0.2)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.192 s,
of (1.3 ± 0.1)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+10.496 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.05 ± 0.14,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.68 ± 0.30,
the peak energy Ep = 185 ± 19 keV,
chi2 = 120/97 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.75 ± 0.27,
the high energy photon index beta = -3.05 ± 0.73,
the peak energy Ep = 200 ± 31 keV,
chi2 = 85.8/69 dof.

All the quoted values are preliminary.
