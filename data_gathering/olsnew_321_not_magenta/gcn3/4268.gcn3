At 15:22:35 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 051113 (trigger=163765).
The spacecraft did not slew to this burst because of the Sun-angle observing
constraint; this burst is 39 deg from the Sun.  The BAT on-board calculated
location is RA,Dec 187.222d,-26.391d {12h 28m 53s,-26d 23' 25"} (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows a single peak with a total duration of ~10 sec.
The peak count rate was ~1400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 seconds
after the trigger.
