P. Rodriguez-Pascual and R. Gonzalez-Riestra from the XMM-Newton SOC
report:
 
Preliminary EPIC-pn images, light-curves and spectra from the XMM-Newton
observation of the field of GRB 040827 are available at the home-page of
the XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre:

http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb040827/index.shtml

The XMM-EPIC exposure started less than 4.5 hours after the notification
of the outburst was received (or roughly 6 hours after the IBAS
detection). The light curve of the source reported in GCN 2678,
XMMUJ151701.3-160828, is highly variable, decreasing from 0.07 to 0.02
counts/sec (0.2-7 keV) during the 54 ksec of the observation. The
average observed flux in the 2-10 keV band is approximately 1E-13
erg cm-2 s-1
