K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this event at 08362 s.
Its duration was approximately 0.15 s.  We have triangulated
it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)= 57.940,
+19.247 degrees, with radius 36.337 +/- 1.892 degrees (3 sigma).

As this annulus does not include any of the known SGRs, this
event is probably a short/hard GRB.

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as this
burst was not observed by Ulysses or Mars Odyssey, a small
error box cannot be obtained for it.
