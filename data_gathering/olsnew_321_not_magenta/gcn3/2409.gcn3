TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2409
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030929 (short/hard; annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind  and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this 0.45 s long GRB at
52035 seconds.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered  at RA, Decl(2000)= 275.939,  -7.164 degrees, whose radius is
71.705 +/-  2.324 degrees (3 sigma).  As this annulus does not
include any of the known SGRs, this event is probably a short/hard
GRB.

As this event was not observed by Mars Odyssey or Ulysses, a small
error box cannot be derived for it.
