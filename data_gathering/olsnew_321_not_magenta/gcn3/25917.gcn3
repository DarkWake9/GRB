Brajesh Kumar, D. K. Sahu, G. C. Anupama (IIA), V. Bhalerao (IITB) report on behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We observed ZTF19acbpsuf with the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, India. The observations started on 2019-10-01 (17:31:33 UT). Multiple frames in Bessell VRI-bands (each exposure 300 sec) were obtained. The object is clearly visible in all frames. The preliminary PSF magnitudes of initial images (calibrated using USNO-B1.0 catalogue) are following:
