P.M. Vreeswijk, E. Rol (Univ. of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

The central 4.5'x4.5' of the error box of GRB 001204 (Hurley et al.,
GCN #895) was observed for 30 min. in Ks with the New Technology
Telescope (NTT) at the European Southern Observatory on December 9.14
and 14.02 UT, respectively 4.8 and 9.7 days after the burst. The
limiting magnitude (5-sigma, aperture radius of one FWHM, or 0.8") for
both epochs is Ks=20.0. No counterpart candidate is found.

We appreciate the assistance of the NTT team.
