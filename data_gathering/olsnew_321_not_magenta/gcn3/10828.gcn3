Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100606A (trigger #424031)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 10824).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 350.617, -66.234 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 22m 28.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -66d 14' 03.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 25%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows an initial FRED peak starting at ~T-0.2 sec,
peaking at ~T+0.5 sec.  Then there are two peaks at ~T+12 and ~T+20 sec
followed by a roughly exponential decay out to ~T+180 sec.  Another, weak peak
occurs at ~T+200 followed by some very weak emission out to ~T+370 sec,
and possibly out to ~T+500 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 480 +- 150 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.3 to T+672.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.35 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.4 +- 0.4 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
