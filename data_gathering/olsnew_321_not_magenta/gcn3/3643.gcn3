E. Berger, M. Lopez-Morales (Carnegie) and D. Osip (LCO) report on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We re-observed the XRT error circle (GCN 3636) of GRB 050717 (GCN 3633)  
with the Wide-Field Infrared Camera on the du Pont 100-inch telescope at
Las Campanas Observatory on 2005 July 18.98 UT (37.0 hours after the
burst) in K-band.  None of the three objects detected in our previous
images within the XRT error circle (GCN 3639) have faded.  In addition, we
obtained I-band images with the LDSS-3 instrument on the Magellan/Clay
telescope on 2005 July 18.06 and 18.97 UT (14.9 and 36.8 hours after the
burst, respectively).  The same three sources visible in the K-band images
are detected but have not faded.

Please note that the UT date of our first K-band observation was misquoted
in GCN 3639; the correct date is 2005 July 18.01 (13.7 hours after the
burst)."
