TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 071101: Swift XRT position
DATE:    07/11/02 06:21:15 GMT
FROM:    Claudio Pagani at PSU/Swift-XRT  <pagani@astro.psu.edu>

C. Pagani (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the GRB 071101 (trigger=295779, McBreen et al., GCN Circ.
7030) beginning 85 s after the BAT trigger.
In the first 13 ks of Photon Counting mode data a faint X-ray source is detected
at the position RA,Dec = 48.1772, +62.5002 deg, equivalent to:

RA(J2000) =  03h 12m 42.53s
Dec(J2000)= +62d 30' 00.7"

with an error of radius 7 arcseconds (90%, including boresight uncertainties).
This is 102 arcseconds from the BAT position (GCN Circ. 7030) and 103
arcseconds from the 2MASS-cataloged galaxy, 2MASX J03124721+6231391 reported by
Ofek (GCN Circ. 7031).

Further analysis will be reported in a subsequent circular.
