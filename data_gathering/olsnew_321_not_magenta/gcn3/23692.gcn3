A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI), D. A. Kann, C. C. 
Thoene, and L. Izzo (both HETH/IAA-CSIC) report:

At the position of the ultra-bright GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN 
#23688, Tyurana et al., GCN #23690), we detect a source in Pan-STARRS 
archival imaging with:

r' = 21.229 +/- 0.156 mag,
i' = 21.574 +/- 0.198 mag,
z' = 20.994 +/- 0.179 mag.

We suggest this source is the host galaxy of GRB 190114C, and that it is 
at low-z. We note this GRB is similar to GRB 130427A, being about half 
as bright in INTEGRAL SPI-ACS counts.
