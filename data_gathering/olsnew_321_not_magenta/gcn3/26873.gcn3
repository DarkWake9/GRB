Dimple, R. Gupta, V. K. Jha, A. Aryan, A. Ghosh, K. Misra, A. Kumar, and S. B. Pandey report: 

We carried out observation of GRB 200122A (Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 26844) with the 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at the Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES), India. 
The observation was started on 2020-01-22 at 23:34:50 UTC. We observed a series of 3 x 300s exposures using R filter (Johnson-Cousins) covering Swift XRT enhanced position RA, Dec = 210.01807, +27.54884 (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 26846). 

We do not detect any new optical source within the Swift XRT enhanced error circle neither in single image nor in the combined image. 

We obtained the 3-sigma upper limit as follows 

T_start-T0 (hours) Start_UTC End_UTC Filter 3-sigma upper limit

21.9 23:34:50 23:49:50 R >21.13 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Photometry is done based on USNO-B1.0 catalog. This magnitude is not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
