The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160824A (Evans et al., GCN 19855) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Aug 25.11, Aug 26.27, Aug 
28.29, and Sep 01.29 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Goad et al., GCN 19857), with 3sigma upper limits of 444 uJy, 
126 uJy, 117 uJy, and 117 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
