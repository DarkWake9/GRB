The AMON,  IceCube, and HAWC collaborations report:

The AMON NuEm stream channel found a coincidence alert from the
IceCube online neutrino selection + HAWC daily monitoring analysis.
The analysis looks for IceCube neutrino events -mostly atmospheric
in origin- around the position and transit time of a HAWC cluster of
likely gamma rays, as identified in the integrated observations from
a single transit, in this case having a duration of 5.08 hours.

The HAWC transit interval starts from 12/08/2021 23:33:44 UT -
12/09/2021 04:38:48 UT
(End of the HAWC transit time)

The location of the coincidence is reported as
RA (J2000): 12.03 deg
Dec (J2000): -5.75 deg
Location uncertainty (50% containment): 0.18 deg (statistical only).
Location uncertainty (90% containment): 0.33 deg (statistical only).

The false alarm rate (FAR) of this coincidence is 2.06 per year.
We encourage follow-up observations of the alert region contingent on
the availability of resources and interest, given the quoted FAR.

AMON seeks to perform a real-time correlation analysis of the
high-energy signals across all known astronomical messengers. More
