The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:46:32 UT on 23 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200323A (trigger 606681997.955906 / 200323782).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 156.5, Dec = -55.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 26m, -55d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
