Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190320A (trigger #893808)
(Gropp, et al., GCN Circ.23973).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 117.824, -45.876 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  07h 51m 17.8s 
  Dec(J2000) = -45d 52' 33.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 29%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single episode with some superimposed
structure from roughly T-25 to T+40 sec.  The spacecraft slewed away from the 
burst position at around T+500 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.0 +- 12.1 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-27.20 to T+44.80 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.20 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.20 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
