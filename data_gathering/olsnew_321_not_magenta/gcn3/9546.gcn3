Using the data set from T-239 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090621A (trigger #355303)
(Curran, et al., GCN Circ. 9540).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 10.987, 61.938 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 43m 56.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 56' 17.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two small precursor peaks starting
at ~T-30 sec, peaking at ~T-20 and T+10 sec, and returning to background
at ~T+100 sec.  Then the mmain emission starts at ~T+210 sec, peaks at ~T+240
and T+265 sec, and returns to background around T+350 sec.
T90 is not possible because of a lack of the complete set of event by event
data set for this burst.   This also prevents giving spectral results.
