K.L. Page (U. Leicetser) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift has performed a second follow-up observation of the ground-detected
Swift-BAT GRB 190331B (Page et al., GCN Circ. 24041). An additional 2.7 ks
of data were collected, entirely in Photon Counting mode, 334.5 ks after
the trigger time

The count rate of the possible afterglow counterpart ("Source 1")
mentioned in GCN Circ. 24041 remains constant across both observations, at
about 0.01 ct s^-1. We therefore conclude that we did not detect an X-ray
afterglow for GRB 190331B.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
