the Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the first four orbits of GRB
050701 ToO (Racusin et al., GCN3557; Krimm et al., GCN 3558).  The X-ray 
source is clearly fading during this time period, indicating that it is the 
GRB afterglow.  The refined
coordinates for the X-ray afterglow are:

RA(J2000) = 15h 09m 01.8s,  Dec(J2000) = -59:24:50.1

The estimated uncertainty is 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).

A preliminary spectral fit to all of the PC data gives a spectral power
law photon index of 1.8 +/- 0.5 in the [0.2-10] keV band, assuming
Galactic absorption (5.6E20cm^-2). The average estimated flux for this
model in the 2.0-10.0 keV range is approximately 1.9E-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 at
6770s after the trigger time.  A preliminary estimate of the X-ray decay 
power-law index is alpha = -0.66.
