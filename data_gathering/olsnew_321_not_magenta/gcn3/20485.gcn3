Kutyrev (GSFC), William H. Lee (UNAM), Eleonora Troja (GSFC), and Alan M.
Watson (UNAM) report:

We observed a number of iPTF candidates (Kasliwal et al. LVC GCN#20398)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astron칩mico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro M치rtir from 2017/01 11.28--11.30 UTC (6.85
days since the GW trigger; Shawhan et al. LVC GCN #20364) and again from
2017/01 12.44--12.46 UTC.

At positions consistent with each iPTF source position, we report riZY
photometry for the probable host galaxy from the first epoch. In comparison
with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain:

15.97+/-0.01 (0.29)

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the source direction. Exposure times (dt) are reported in
hours.

We find no evidence for variation in flux at >2-sigma confidence from an
image subtraction analysis between our two epochs.

M치rtir.
