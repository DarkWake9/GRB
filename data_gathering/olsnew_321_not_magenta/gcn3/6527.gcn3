P. Romano (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB) and
R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

BAT trigger 282176 (2007-06-13 11:13:41 UT) was not a GRB. 
Instead, it is the remnant of the Cyg X-1 peak after
bright source peak removal in the image (cleaning). 

This is an instrumental and statistical artifact, and does 
not indicate an interesting variation in the Cyg X-1 flux.
