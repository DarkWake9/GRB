We report further analysis of Fermi-GBM GRB 090929A (Rau, et al.,
GCN Circ. 9962).  The BAT ground-calculated position is the same
as stated in Cummings et al. (GCN Circ. 9966),
RA, Dec = 56.494, -5.952 or

RA (J2000) 03h 45m 57.9s
Dec (J2000) -05d 57' 50"

with an estimated 90% containment error radius of 3 arcmin. The
partial coding was 73-90% during the burst.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows multiple peaks and spikes, at
T+1, T+2, T+4, T+5, and T+10 sec, where T0 is 04:33:07. T90 was
7 +- 2 seconds.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T+12 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 0.96 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.69 +- 0.07 x 10^-06 ergs/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T+0.5 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
5.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
