report:

We observed the field of GRB200806A (Ambrosi et al, GCN 28211) with the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 08-06-2020 starting at 06:22:50 UT (T+15
hrs). We performed a series of exposures in R filter with a total exposure
of 5810 s. The weather conditions were clear during the hours of
observation with an average airmass of 1.6.

We find no new source within the enhanced XRT position error circle
(Beardmore et al., GCN 28214) and report the following 3-sigma upper limit:

T_mid       ||Exposure     ||Filter      ||Limit
T+16 hrs   ||5810s          ||R             ||19.6

The limit is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and is not
corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the commissioning
phase.
