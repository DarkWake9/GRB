K. S. Kawabata, H. Akitaya, M. Yamanaka, K. Takaki, T. Uehara, and
M. Yoshida (Hiroshima Univ.) report on behalf of Kanata team:

We performed a series of optical imaging polarimetry for the optical 
afterglow of GRB 120212A (Guidorzi et al.; GCN 12932) using HOWPol attached 
to the 1.5-m Kanata telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan. 

Our first exposure began at t=74 sec since Swift/BAT trigger (Sonbas 
et al.; GCN 12930), but the bright twilight sky shaded the afterglow 
until t=22 min. Our quick-look analysis indicates that Rc magnitude of 
the afterglow was 16.5 at t=23 min and faded to 17.6 at t=58 min. 
Further analysis is ongoing.
