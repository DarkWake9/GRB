The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:46:28 UT on 11 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220211B (trigger 666287193.962164 / 220211657).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 3.8, Dec = 46.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 15m, 46d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 28.0 degrees.
