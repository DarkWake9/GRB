P.A.Milne, G.G.Williams (Steward Obs), H.-S.Park (LLNL),
on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team report:
 
We observed the field of GRB 061102B (SWIFT trigger 236481)
starting at UT=06:13:54 (38s after the BAT trigger),
with the 0.6m SLOTIS telescope at Kitt Peak, AZ.
We obtained 5 x 10-sec, 5 x 20-sec and 30 x 30-sec images
during the observation at failry high airmass.
 
Comparison of the resulting co-added images to the relevant
DSS2 image reveals no new sources within the BAT error circle
(Holland et al., GCN 5778). No fading source was detected when
comparing early and late epoch summed images. We estimate a
3-sigma upper limit of R ~ 19.8 mag. for the 5 x 10-sec exposures.
