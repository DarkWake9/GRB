D. B. Fox (Penn State) reports:

"I note the presence of a bright (J_tot=13.4 mag) galaxy, 2MASX
J02194771-0712008, within the BAT localization region of the
Swift-detected short burst GRB 090417 (Mangano et al., GCN 9133).
Considering the average sky density of 2MASS extended source catalog
objects of this magnitude or brighter, the presence of such a galaxy
within a region of 3-arcmin radius is suggestive at roughly
97%-confidence."
