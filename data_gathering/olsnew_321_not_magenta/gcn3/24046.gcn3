report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 05:57:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) possibly triggered and
located PSR B1055-52 (trigger=896552).  Swift did not slew due to the low merit
value of this trigger.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 164.407, -52.387, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 57m 38s
   Dec(J2000) = -52d 23' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, there is nothing
visible in the light curve. 

Due to the low image significance and the distance to the PSR_B1055-52 source
(~5 arcmin) this identification of this trigger is not strong.  The proper
identification will require the full data set. 

This source lies within the current (Sector 10) field-of-view of TESS camera 2.
