We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 180620B (Evans et al. GCN 22807; Schweyer & Schady GCN 22819) using the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Spectroscopic observations started on 09:27 UT on 21 June 2018, i.e. 0.73 days after burst. In the resulting spectrum, we find a series of strong absorption lines that we identify as Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Zn II, Cr II, Al II and Al III at a common redshift of 1.1175. At this redshift, we also detect emission lines of [O II], [Ne III] and Balmer lines. Both absorption and emission lines show velocity structure. The absorption profiles are broad and spread over more than 800 km/s in velocity space.

We are grateful to the visiting observers, Jean-Christophe Loison and Pedro Machado, for giving up some of their observing time. We thank the ESO staff, Marcela Espinoza and Alain Smette, for excellent support.
