(API/UvA) report on behalf of the X-shooter GRB collaboration:

We observed the field of short GRB140622A (D'Elia et al., GCN 16433) with
the VLT X-shooter spectrograph covering a spectral range 3200A to 18000A,
with a total exposure time of 2x600s. Observations started at UT 10:10:32,
~34 minutes after the trigger. The slit was positioned on the object at
RA(J2000)  =  21:08:41.73, Dec(J2000) = -14:25:06.5 identified by Tanga et
al. (GCN 16435), at the border of the 2.6" XRT error circle.

We detect emission lines from this source at a redshift of z~0.959:
H-alpha, H-beta, [OII], [OIII]. It is likely that this is the host galaxy
of GRB140622A. A very faint trace is detected redwards of ~7000A. This
wavelength coincides with a Balmer jump at the host redshift.

We thank the staff at Paranal for their support in obtaining these
observations.
