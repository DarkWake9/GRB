J. Deng and Y. Zhu (NAOC) report:

We took a 60s unfiltered CCD image and a 600s R-band image of NGC 2770 on 2008 Jan 10 18:19 UT and 18:22 UT with the BFOSC 
instrument of the NAOC 2.16m telescope at the Xinglong Observatory, China. An optical source was clearly seen in both images 
which was conincident in position with the X-ray transient reported in GCN 7159. It was roughly 2 mag fainter than SN 2007uy in 
the same galaxy. The source was not seen in the archival SDSS image of NGC 2770 that we retrieved from nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu. 
We suspect that this source is the SN counterpart of the X-ray transient (a XRF). Spectroscopic observations are in progress 
despite the cloudy weather condition.
