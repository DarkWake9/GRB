D. C. Morris, D. N. Burrows, J. A. Kennea, J. L. Racusin (PSU), and N. 
Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050814 at 11:38:57 UT (Retter et al. 
2005, GCN 3799).  The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT 
position and the XRT began taking data at 11:41:15 UT (138 seconds after 
the BAT trigger).  In spite of the presence of a bright source in the 
field, the XRT did not succeed in calculating an on-board centroid, 
probably because of a high background level.  In the ground-processed data, 
we find a bright, uncataloged, rapidly fading X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 17:36:45,
Dec(J2000) = +46:20:19.

We identify this as the afterglow of the GRB.  We estimate an uncertainty 
of about 7 arcseconds radius (90% containment).   This source is located 44 
arcseconds from the BAT position in GCN 3799.
