Damerdji, Y. (CESR-OMP/OHP), Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP),
Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 050805b detected by SWIFT
(trigger 149131) with the 0.8m (F/15) telescope
located at the Observatoire de Haute Provence
Observatory (OHP), France.
Camera is an Andor 47-40 equiped by a R band filter.

First image was begined 16.4 min after the GRB.
Weather conditions were excellents.

We detected no new source comparing our
succesive frames. From the first frame we give an
limit:

TMid(min since GRB)  Exp(s)  R-mag
   18.87               300     >20.3

Limiting magnitude was estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars.
