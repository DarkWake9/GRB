Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130603B (trigger #557310)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 14735).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 172.222, 17.063 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 28m 53.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +17d 03' 48.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like spike starting
at ~T_0.000, peaking at ~T+0.012 sec, and returning to baseline at~T+0.2sec.
There is a smaller pulse ridding on the tail of the initial pulse.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.18 +- 0.02 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.01 to T+0.26 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.82 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.36 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
