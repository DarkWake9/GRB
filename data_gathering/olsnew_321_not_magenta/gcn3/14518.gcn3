(YNAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We again observed the afterglow of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope from 15:46:37 UT on 2013-04-30. 
We used the sloan filter of r' and obtained two images with the exposure time of 900s each image. The GRB afterglow decayed to r'~19.4 with a middle time of
80.2 hrs post-burst. 

We thank the GMG staff, especially Jian-Duo He and Gui-Hua He for performing these observations.
