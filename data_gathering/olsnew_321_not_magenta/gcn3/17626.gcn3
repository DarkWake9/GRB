WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150323A (Amaral-Rogers
et al., GCN 17611) starting at 03:23:43 UT, ~34 minutes after
the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. The afterglow reported by Cenko & Perley (GCN 17612)
was not detected in any single image, but was marginally detected
in the co-add image of 20 clear band images. We estimated the
brightness is R~20.3 +/- 0.3 at a mean time of 71.2 minutes after
the burst.
