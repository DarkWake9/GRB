Report on behalf of the University of Wyoming GRB response team and the
FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,  identified in (GCN
1986), in the Johnson V-Band with the RBO 0.6m telescope at Red Buttes
Wyoming.  We obtained 6, 180s exposures on March 30th UT. The observations
were carried out under fair to poor conditions.  Aperture photometry was
performed and calibrated utilizing the standards reported by Henden et
al., (GCN 2023).
We initially measured the magnitude of the OT to be V=15.57 +/- 0.01 at
02:59UT which faded by 0.06 during the short observational period.




Further observations are currently being undertaken, and more data for the
V filter will follow.
