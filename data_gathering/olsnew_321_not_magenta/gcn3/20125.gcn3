Swift-IceCube collaboration:

Swift has observed the field of the IceCube HESE event IceCube-161103
utilising the on-board 19-point tiling pattern to cover a region centred
on RA,Dec (J2000) = (40.874,+12.616), with a radius of approximately 0.8 
degrees. Swift-XRT collected between 150 and 250 s of PC mode data per 
tile. The observations were taken between 13:58:30 and 18:55:15 UT on 
2016 November 3 (i.e. from 17.5 ks to 35.3.5 ks after the neutrino 
trigger), and covered 2.1 square degrees.

Four X-ray sources are detected in the observations. None of these are
known X-ray emitters, however all are faint, and well below the RASS 
limits, therefore we do not consider any of them to be likely 
counterparts to the IceCube trigger.

The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate in the rest of the field 
ranges is 0.03 ct s^-1, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 
1.2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a typical AGN spectrum (NH=3e20 cm^-2, 
Gamma=1.7). Overlaps between the different tiles accounts for 0.5 square 
degrees: in these regions the 3-sigma upper limit is 0.02 ct
s^-1, corresponding to 8.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Details of the four detected X-ray sources are below. All fluxes are
0.3-10 keV and assume the same AGN spectrum as above.
