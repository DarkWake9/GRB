GRB IKI FuN

We observed the optical transient of ZTF21aakruew/AT2021cwd (Yao et al., 
GCN 29508) which is probably an afterglow of GRB 210212B (Svinkin et 
al., GCN 29511) with AZT-20 telescope of Assy-Turgen observatory 
starting on 2021-02-15 (UT) 17:33:23. The optical transient is 
marginally detected in a stacked image in r'-filter.

Preliminary photometry of the object  is following

The midtime value (t-T0) given in the table above  was counted from GRB 
trigger of 2021-02-12 (UT) 02:37:57 (Svinkin et al., GCN 29511).

The power-law index  of the light curve (alpha ~ 1.7) is consistent with 
an afterglow after jet break. The light curve can be found in
