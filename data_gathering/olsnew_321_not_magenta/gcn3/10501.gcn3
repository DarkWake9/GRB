Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100316A (trigger #416076)
(Baumgartner, et al., GCN Circ. 10484).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 251.953, 71.819 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 47m 48.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +71d 49' 09.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 16%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like pulse starting at ~T-1 sec,
peaking at ~t+2 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
7.0 +- 0.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.2 to T+6.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.46 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.2 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.94 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
