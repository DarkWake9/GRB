A. A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL), K. Page (U. Leicester), T. S. Poole

J. Nousek (PSU) on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT started observing GRB050911 16408 s (4.56 hours) after the
burst (Page et al. GCN 3961). The delay was caused by firstly
an earth limb constraint and then Swift spacecraft loss of lock
on the star tracker. No new source was found within the XRT error
circle (Page et al. GCN 3967) to the following upper limits.

Filter T_range (s) Exp (s) 3sig UL

  V     21591-22041  900    20.2
  B     16408-17291  883    21.0

  UVM2  22498-23081  583    20.9
  UVW2  32261-32961  700    21.4

Where T_range is the time range post-trigger over which the summed
images were accumulated and Exp is the total exposure time of the
summed image. The magnitude upper limits are not corrected for
extinction.
