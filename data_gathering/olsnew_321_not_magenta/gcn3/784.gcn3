V.Rumjantsev and I.Savanov (on behalf of Crimean Observatory and Space
Research Institute (Moscow) GRB follow-up teams) report:

We have obtained on 2000 Sept. 01  21:24:15 (UT) images of the IPN error box
(Hurley, et al. GCN 779) for GRB 000830 with the AT-64 telescope
(D=640, F/1.4) with a SBIG ST-8 1530x1020 CCD and without filter in visible
light. Conditions were not so good.
Our images cover all but the square half degree. We find no optical
afterglow
candidate as compared with the Digital Sky Survey (DSS) to a 3-sigma
limiting
magnitude of  ~ 20.0 mag."
