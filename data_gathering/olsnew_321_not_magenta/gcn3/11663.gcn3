A.J. van der Horst (USRA), C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC), A.P. Kamble
(U of Wisconsin Milwaukee) and R.A.M.J. Wijers (U of Amsterdam)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 110205A afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at February 6 19.44 UT to
February 7 07.41 UT, i.e. 1.72 - 2.22 days after the burst (GCN 11629).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical
counterpart (GCN 11633). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around
that position is 105 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for
a point source at the position of the optical counterpart is 44 +/- 35 
microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
