B. N. Barlow (PSU), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC), C. Gronwall (PSU),
D. M. Palmer (LANL), M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) and
B.-B. Zhang (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:16:10 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120918A (trigger=534015).  Swift could not slew to the
burst because of the Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 181.054, -32.758 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 04m 13s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 45' 26"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 17:37 UT on 2012 November 15. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. N. Barlow (bnb2 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
