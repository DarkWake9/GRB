D. A. Perley (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report:

We imaged the location of Swift GRB 140629A (Lien et al., GCN 16477) 
with the Palomar 60-inch (P60) robotic telescope on UT 2014-06-30 
between 04:10 and 04:44 UT, in the r' filter.  We acquired 10 exposures 
of 180 seconds each.  The optical afterglow (Lien et al., GCN 16477;
Yurkov et al. GCN 16478) is well-detected in the stacked image. 
Comparing to SDSS field stars, we measure a magnitude of:

r = 20.91 +/- 0.03   (t_mid = 0.590 days)

Further observations are ongoing.
