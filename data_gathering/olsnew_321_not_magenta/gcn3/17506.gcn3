A. Nicuesa Guelbenzu (TLS Tautenburg), P. Wiseman, P. Schady and J. 
Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We continued to observe the field of GRB 150222A (Swift trigger 632180; 
Bernadini et al., GCN 17486) for a second night, simultaneously in 
g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at 
the 2.2 m MPG telescope at ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations began at 06:25:38 UT on February 24, ~34 hours after the 
GRB trigger. They were performed at an average seeing of 1.3" and at an 
average airmass of 1.1//.
In 106 min of total exposures in g'r'i'z', we detect a source in all 
optical bands towards the north-eastern edge of the the 1.7" enhanced 
Swift-XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 17494) , at a position 
consistent with that reported in Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al. (GCN 17495).
In 115 min of total NIR exposures in the JHK bands, no source is 
detected within the enhanced XRT error circle.

We detect no fading of the source between the two epochs, and therefore 
suggest that this is not the afterglow, but could be the host galaxy 
instead, unless we caught an afterglow plateau phase.
