collaboration:

Fermi GBM detected GRB 160206B (trigger 476446756 / bn160206430) at
2016-02-06 10:19:12.43. At 10:29:40, about 10 minutes after the burst, we
began searching for optical counterparts using the Palomar 48-inch Oschin
telescope (P48).

We imaged 114 fields covering an area of 379 deg^2 and covering most of
the 2-sigma statistical+systematic region of the final Fermi GBM
localization. We estimate a 84% prior probability that these fields
contain the true location of the source. Sifting through candidate
variable sources using image subtraction and standard iPTF vetting
procedures, we detected the following optical transient candidates:

Times are in hours since the GBM trigger. Magnitudes are in the Mould R
filter and in the AB system, calibrated with respect to point sources in
SDSS as described in Ofek et al. (2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664065).

Further observations of the above candidates are encouraged to determine
their nature and if one of them is the optical afterglow of the GRB. We
have scheduled additional imaging of the P48 fields tonight.

The diagram http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Brad.Cenko/Fermi476446756.pdf
shows the locations of our candidates and the P48 fields in relation to
the Fermi GBM 1-, 2-, and 3-sigma statistical+systematic contours.
