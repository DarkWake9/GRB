T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) and L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 04:00:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070920 (trigger=291614). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 100.932, +72.227 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 43m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = +72d 13' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is often the case with 64-second
image triggers, the BAT light curve shows no obvious
variation in the count rate. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled.  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Grupe (grupe AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
