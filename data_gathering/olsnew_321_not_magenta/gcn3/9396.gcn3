G. W. Christie (Stardome, New Zealand), A. de Ugarte Postigo
(ESO, Chile) and  T. Natusch (Stardome, New Zealand) on
behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 090516 (Rowlinson et al. GCN
9374) with the Stardome 0.4m telescope located in Auckland
(New Zealand) starting at 09:25UT. We used a SG530 filter
that transmits wavelengths above 5300 Angstroms and a SBIG
ST-L-6303E CCD (KAF-6303E detector). A 9x300s combined
exposure with mean epoch 16.4080 May (80 minutes after the
burst) shows an object at the position of the afterglow
(Guidorzi et al. GCN 9375) measured at R = 20.8 +/- 0.2 as
compared to USNO-B1.0 stars.  We note that with the GRB at
a redshift of 4.1 (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 9383),
Ly-alpha falls within the R-band, so that comparison of
clear and very broad band filters such as ours with R-band
has to be handled with care.
