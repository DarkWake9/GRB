N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan, D. Steeghs (U. Warwick) report:

We note that the field of NGC 4993 was observed as part
of the VISTA Hemisphere Survey on 9 April 2014.  No source
is visible at the location of the candidate counterpart 
(Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529).  We obtain a 3-sigma upper 
limit of J(AB)=21.6, significantly fainter than the provisional magnitude
of J(AB)=17.5+/-0.1 reported for the infrared transient 
(Tanvir et al. LVC GCN 21544).
