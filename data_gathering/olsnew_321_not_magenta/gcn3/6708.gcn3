At 19:55:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070805 (trigger=287088). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 245.043, -59.945 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 20m 10s
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 56' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows two peaks, the first
is ~5 sec in duration and the second peak is broader and weaker
ending around T+40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze.  The burst will come out of constraint at T+31 minutes. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. M. Parsons (parsons AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
