report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We continued to observe the field of GRB 150314A (Hagen et al., GCN
17573) using the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with
the ALFOSC camera. We obtained 4x600 s R-band images with a median
time of 02:16:32 UT on 2015-03-16, i.e., 45.35 hr after the burst, and
in the seeing of 1.0"-1.5".

The optical afterglow (Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 17574; Trotter et al.,
GCN 17577) is still detected in our stacked image, with m(R) = 23.9
+/- 0.3 mag, calibrated with the same USNO B1 stars that were used in
our previous report (Xu et al., GCN 17582). Together with previous
observations (e.g., Perley & Cenko, GCN 17584; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN
17585), so far the object still nicely fits the decaying law of F(t) ~
t^-0.9.
