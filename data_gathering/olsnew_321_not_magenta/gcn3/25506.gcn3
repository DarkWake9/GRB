In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190828j at T0 = 2019-08-28 
06:34:05.756
UT a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that the 
Gamma-Ray
Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered more than 15% of the 90% c.l.
localization region (LR) (32% of 90% c.l. localization region (LR) is 
occulted
by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S190828j 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are 
obtained:

from 7.9e-07 to 9.74e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 36% of 
the LR
over the time interval ( T0 -2s ; T0 + 2s );
from 6.5e-07 to 6.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 34% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 5s );
from 3.39e-07 to 6e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 34% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 10s );
from 1.3e-07 to 5.91e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 36% of 
the LR
over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

A map in Galactic coordinates showing the AGILE FoV at T0 is available 
at the

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
