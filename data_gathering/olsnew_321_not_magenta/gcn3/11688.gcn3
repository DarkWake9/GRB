V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI),  A. Volnova (SAI MSU), E.
Klunko (ISTP) report on behalf of larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed  the field of the Swift GRB 110201A (Siegel et al., GCN
11622) with Shajn telescope of CrAO in filter R between  Feb. 01 (UT)
17:01 - 18:04, and with AZT-33IK telescope  between Feb. 01 (UT) 16:31
- 17:07. Using stacked image of CrAO observations we detect  a diffuse
source (A) at ~4" offset of a center of the XRT error circle (Siegel
et al., GCN 11622), see also http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/444230/.  The
coordinates of the center of the source (A) are (J2000) RA =
09:10:29.84, Dec =  +88:36:17.5 with uncertainty of 0.5" in both
coordinates.

The photometry of the source is based on the USNO-B1.0 star
1786-0003311 (09:12:09.70 +88:36:01.0) assuming R=17.64 is following:

T0+         Filter,   Exposure,  source A, mag, UpperLimit
(mid, d)              (s)

0.3305    R       45x60          21.9 +/- 0.1     23.4

Would be the source (A) a host galaxy of GRB 110201A, the galaxy could
be a relatively close  (z <1) taking into account its brightness.
