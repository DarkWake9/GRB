S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF-Milano), J.Borkowski (CAMK-Torun), M.Beck
(ISDC-Versoix) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team and F.I.Mirabel
(SAp-Saclay) on behalf of the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

A strong increase in the activity of SGR 1806-20 has been detcted by IBAS
starting at 13:57 UT of October 5.  The activity consists of an
approximately 6 min long, multipeaked outburst, followed by a few shorter
bursts.

During the peaks of the long outburst the counting rate in the IBIS/ISGRI
detector saturates the available telemetry.

Analysis is in progress to estimate the  event fluence and spectrum.

Rapid observations at other wavelengths are encouraged.
