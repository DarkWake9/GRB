The long bright hard GRB 100414B (localized by Fermi-LAT;
Takahashi et al., GCN 10594) triggered Konus-Wind
at T0=08427.289s UT (02:20:27.289)

The burst light curve consists of a single slowly
rising pulse which ends abruptly after a culmination
at T0+22.528. A total duration of the burst is ~25 s.
No spectral evolution is apparent in the course of the burst.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB100414_T08427/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.06(+/-0.06)x10-4 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+22.528s
of 8.6(+/-0.6)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+25.856 s) is well fitted
in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.46 (-/+0.07),
the high energy photon index beta = -3.2(-1.5, +0.4),
the peak energy Ep = 547(-21, +22)keV (chi2 = 97/76 dof).

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+19.200 to T0+25.586 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.81(+/-0.1),
and Ep = 595(-62, +75) keV (chi2 = 75/77 dof).

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
