A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (INAF/OAR & ASI/ASDC), W. Boschin, D. Carosati (INAF-TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration: 

We observed the field of GRB 161014A (Racusin et al., GCN 20035) with the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) equipped with DOLoRes. Observations were carried out in the r-sdss filter. Observations started on Oct 15 at 00:19:03 UT (~11.8 hours after the burst) and consist in a single image lasting 120 seconds. 

The optical afterglow (Morita et al., GCN 20036 and GCN 20046; Guidorzi et al., GCN 20037; Xin et al., GCN 20038; Nakaoka et al., GCN 20039; Mazaeva et al., GCN 20042; Heintz et al. GCN 20044; Kitaoka et al., GCN 20047) is detected with a magnitude r(AB) = 21.5 +/- 0.3 (calibrated against nearby SDSS stars).
