The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:20:40 UT on 7 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211107A (trigger 658009245.216482 / 211107848).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 183.4, Dec = -61.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 13m, -61d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 17.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 87.0 degrees.
