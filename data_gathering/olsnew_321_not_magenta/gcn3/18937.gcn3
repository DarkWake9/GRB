We observed a single pointing designed to cover the main part of the southern-lobe of the  skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger G211117 with the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope.  The observation covers roughly 30deg x 30deg (FWHM) centered at:

14:45:00 -44:26:00 2015-12-28 00:20 UT

The observations are at a center frequency of 154 MHz, with a 30 MHz bandwidth with 1s integrations and 40 kHz frequency resolution.  A second observation is planned.  Analysis is ongoing.
