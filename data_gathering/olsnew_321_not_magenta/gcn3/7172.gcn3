We inspected the Swift X-ray observations of the X-ray transient
associated with NGC 2770 (Berger & Soderberg 2008; ATel 1353; GCN 7159).
We looked for periodicity in the X-ray data that may hint
on association with a fast rotating object.
We do not identify any (non-instrumental) periodicity in the
data, below the sampling frequency of 0.4 Hz.
We estimate that the fraction of photons that are modulated
periodically (if at all) is smaller than 10%.

The X-ray event started approximately at the beginning
of the XRT observation at UTC 2008 Jan 09.5652. Peak flux (in 10 s
intervals) was achieved about 65 s later.

We note that the analysis is based on 697 photons, within 20 pixels from the
transient location and detected within 1000 s of the
beginning of the XRT observation.
