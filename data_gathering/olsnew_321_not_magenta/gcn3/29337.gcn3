Kumar (ARIES), S.B. Pandey (ARIES) report:

We observed the field of GRB 210104A (Troja et al. GCN #29233) with Aries
Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ADFOSC) mounted on the 3.6m
Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT). The observations started on 2021-01-13
at 19:52:50 UT (9.374 days after the burst). We obtained a set of
consecutive images with short exposure times to avoid saturation from the
nearby bright star. We do not detect any optical counterpart upto a
magnitude limit of 23.2 in the stacked image.
