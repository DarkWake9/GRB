Further to GCN 20881, the following transients were discovered by ATLAS and Pan-STARRS1 during normal operations imaging through the skymap (Cho et al.  GCN 20860) of G277583, the possible coherent wave burst of 20170313 (MJD=57825.94).  Spectra were taken with the UH88/SNIFS on the dates noted below.  Four objects have discovery dates before the G277583 detection time, but are reported here for completeness.

Notes

 1. Registered on TNS as PS17bra, but actually discovered a day earlier by ATLAS as ATLAS17dip, so ATLAS photometry is listed. +11 to +20 days.
 2. SNIa or SNIa-91T, +2 weeks.  Registered on TNS as PS17buq, but actually discovered 8 days earlier by ATLAS as ATLAS17cxv, so ATLAS photometry is listed.
 3. Around +2 weeks.
 4. SNIb-pec? +1 week.
 5. Redshift from SDSS. SNIFS spectrum inconclusive, but observed again on 20170422 at NTT.  NTT spectrum reported above. See ATel #10315.
 6. Narrow Halpha and He I. Nice 20 day rise, discovery 3.5 days after GW170313. No clear epoch based on SNID, based on light curve rising or near peak. At z=0.015 the most recent magnitude o = 17.2 corresponds to roughly -17 mag, therefore more likely a Type IIn than a SN impostor. See also classification by at NTT on 20170423 in ATel #10318.
 7. +11 to +20 days.
 8. Around peak.
 9. Around peak.  Registered on TNS as PS17bxh, but discovered 14 minutes earlier by ATLAS as ATLAS17deq, so ATLAS photometry is listed.
10. Redshift from SDSS. +8 to +10 days.
11. Redshift from SDSS.  Around peak.  Confirmed as SNII on 20170510 by LOSS.  See TNS report.
12. > +20 days.
13. Redshift from SDSS. +11 to +20 days.
14. +11 to +20 days.  Also observed by NTT on 20170423 with NTT.  See ATel #10318.
15. > +20 days. Also observed by FLOYDS on 20170504. See TNS report.
16. Noisy spectrum, no clear features, blue continuum. Confirmed as stellar by NTT observation on 20170429.  See ATel #10334.
17. –7 to –4 days. Forced photometry shows activity on MJD 57829.
18. Flat, featureless continuum. Classification unclear.
19. Redshift from SDSS. Discovered serendipitously when observing 2017cms. SNIFS spectrum inconclusive, but observed again on 20170422 at NTT. NTT spectrum reported above. See ATel #10315.
