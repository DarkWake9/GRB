GRB 040816 was detected by Konus-Wind at 08:19:58.724 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 08:19:53.763 UT. It consisted of
hard short initial peak with a duration of approximately 0.78 s,
and a much less intense and softer peak ~24.5 s after
the trigger time with a tail lasting for approximately 30 s.
The peaks were detected by both instruments and had the same relative
time delay, so we suppose that they had the same origin.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus:
RA(2000) = 311.825 deg,
Decl(2000) = -20.528 deg,
Radius = 27.353 +/- 1.079 degrees (3 sigma ).
