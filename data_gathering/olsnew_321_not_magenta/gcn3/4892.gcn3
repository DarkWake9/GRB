MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB060319.0 
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN 4885 ) by all cameras (unfiltred, 
R-filtred, spectral and high time resolution).

The first unfiltred image was at 2006-03-19 00:58:24.96 UT, 80 s after notice 
time and 162  after the GRB time
The first spectral image was at 2006-03-19 00:58:33 UT, 88 s after
notice time and 170  after the GRB time. There is no OT brighter than 17.7 .
We have aboute 50 unfiltered images.
The limit of sum of first  10 best images is about 19.5 (s/n=3).
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
We do not see any new sources inside XRT position Kennea
et al. (GCN 4886) brighter 19.5 .
We see faint uncatalogizeted object near but outside  XRT position Kennea 
et al. (GCN 4886). The magnitude is about 19.0  at images between 3 - 8 minutes after 
GRB time.

ra = 11 45 31.59
dec= +60  00  26

The reduction is continuing.
