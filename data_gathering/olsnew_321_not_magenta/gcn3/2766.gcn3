P.A. Price (IfA, UH), G. Da Costa (MSO) and N. Noel (IAC) report:

We have produced a finding chart of the optical afterglow candidate
reported in GCN #2765, which is available from

	http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~price/grb041006.ps

The offset from the star marked is 46.95" East and 15.02" North.

We estimate that the optical afterglow was 17th magnitude in our image. 
Observers with spectroscopy resources are encouraged to observe the
source.
