N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick), T.  Wold (JACH)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130131A (Grupe et al. GCN 14166)
with the WFCAM camera on UKIRT, beginning approximately 54 mins
after the BAT trigger.

Within the XRT error circle we detect a single, bright point source
at position:

11 24 30.39
+48 04 33.3
(J2000, uncertainty ~0.5")

Provisional Vega magnitudes (relative to a nearby 2MASS source) are K=16.4,
J=19.4, indicating a rather red source.

Further observations and analysis are ongoing.
