D. A. Frail (NRAO) and A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the VLA to make observations of the short burst GRB050202
detected by Swift (GCN#3005). The full BAT error circle was imaged at
frequencies of 1.43 GHz and 4.86 GHz to an rms noise level of 210
microJy/beam and 40 microJy/beam, respectively. No emission is
detected above the 5-sigma level at either frequency.

Further observations are planned."
