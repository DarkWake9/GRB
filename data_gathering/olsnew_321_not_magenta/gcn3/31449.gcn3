The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:01:47.41 UT on 14 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220114A (trigger 663861712 / 220114585).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 202.9, Dec = -11.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 31m, -11d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
