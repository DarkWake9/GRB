One of the four  MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Kislovodsk
(http://apollo.sai.msu.ru/, D=50 mm, 4x1000 square degrees, 35'' per pix) has 
observed the 70% Fermi large error box  (Trig Nuber 249750316) with 5s 
exposures during all night without time gap between images.

These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitued limit of the each emage is  ~11m. 
Note: the GRB was at the edge of the  camera FOW.
