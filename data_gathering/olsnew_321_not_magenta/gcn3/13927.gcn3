M. Jelinek, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), P. Ferrero (IAC Tenerife),
S. Guziy (Univ. of Nikolaev) and G. Bergond (CAHA Almería), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB 121028A by Swift (Starling et al. GCNC
13913), we triggered the 3.5m CAHA telescope (+ Omega 2000) at the
German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory. Observations (900s each) were taken
in the YJHK-bands, starting at 18:05 UT (i.e. 13 hr post burst). At the
position of the X-ray afterglow (Evans et al. GCNC 13918), we do not
detect a near-IR countepart in any band, particularly down to H = 20.5."
