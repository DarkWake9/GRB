SUBJECT: GRB 050904: Afterglow Astrometry

M. Nysewander, D. Reichart, J. Haislip report on behalf of the UNC GRB team
of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Using a single 348 sec coadd from last night's SOAR data (Haislip et al.,
GCN 3919) and 7 USNO stars, we measure the coordinates of the afterglow to
be:

RA:  00:54:50.794
DEC:  +14:05:09.42

with uncertainties of 1.6" in RA and 2.3" in DEC.

This is consistent with the astrometry of D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 3921)  and
the refined coordinates of the X-ray afterglow (Mineo et al.; GCN 3920).

DR apologizes for the crudeness of our initial astrometry.
