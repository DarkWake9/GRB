A. Moskvitin (SAO RAS, Russia) report on behalf of the larger team.


The field of GRB 160313A (D'Ai et al., GCNC #19171) was observed
with the SAO RAS Zeiss-1000 telescope. The observations started during
the morning twilight, since 10 minutes after the trigger.

In combined image of 4 x 60 seconds in the Rc band we did not detect
any object within the XRT error circle down to the limiting magnitude
R_lim = 18.2. This estimation based on the nearby USNO-B1 stars.
