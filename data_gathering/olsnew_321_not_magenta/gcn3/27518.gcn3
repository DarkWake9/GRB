Swift Observatory Team:

At 02:25:10 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200410A (trigger=965638).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 299.637, +51.763, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 58m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = +51d 45' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks
with a total duration of about 45 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 02:26:51.7 UT, 101.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 299.6456,
51.7813 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 58m 34.94s
   Dec(J2000) = +51d 46' 52.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 68 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.15 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 2.3
(+2.17/-1.95) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 104 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a possible candidate
afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	19:58:35.32 = 299.64717
  DEC(J2000) = +51:46:53.0  = +51.78138
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.6 arc sec. This position is 3.5
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
18.71 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.15. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.15.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
