P. D'Avanzo, M. G. Bernardini, S. Campana (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of  the Swift team:

We have analysed 1.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 140414A (Cummings, GCN 16110), from 40.4 ks to 42.1 ks after the IPN trigger. 
The data are all in Photon Counting (PC) mode. As mentioned by Cummings (GCN 16111), too few stars were present in the field for the star tracker to lock. 
In light of this, the data were processed relaxing some constraints on the attitude file with respect to the standard procedure.

No bright X-ray afterglow is detected inside the refined BAT error circle (Cummings, GCN 16111). The formal 3sigma upper limit is 2.3 x 10^-2 cts/s even if, given the non standard processing, it might result in a slightly higher limit.
