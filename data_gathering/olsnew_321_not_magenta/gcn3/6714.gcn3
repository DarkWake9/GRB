Sabyasachi Pal, C.H. Ishwara-Chandra, Dipankar Bhattacharya and
Atish P. Kamble report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 070612A (Grupe et al, GCN 6509) at
1280 MHz, using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, from
MJD 54305.08 to 54305.26 (UT 2007 Jul24 01:55:21 to 06:12:36).
This interval corresponds to 41.97-42.15 days after the burst.
The afterglow was not detected. The formal flux density at the
position of the optical afterglow (Cenko et al, GCN 6525)
was 109 +/- 64 micro Jy (1-sigma).

We thank the GMRT staff who made this observation possible.
GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of
the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
