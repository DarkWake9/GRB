K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 80167 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   5.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.0E-07 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  5.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over  .25 seconds
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
whose approximate area is 274. sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
