N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester),M. Messa (Stockholm Univ., Oskar Klein Centre), 
E. Gafton (NOT, Stockholm Univ. and Oskar Klein Centre) and I. R. Losada 
(Nordita and Stockholm Univ.) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We continued the monitoring of GRB 160303A (Beardmore et al., 
GCN 19126) with MOSCA at the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope 
(La Palma, Spain).

On a 9x300s  observation with mean epoch 2:10 UT of 5 March 2016 
(37.27 hr after the burst) we detect the afterglow (Butler et al GCN19131) 
at a magnitude of r = 25.2 +/- 0.2, as compared to the SDSS field stars. 
This is consistent with the magnitude reported by GROND (Bolmer et al. 
GCN 19150) at a similar epoch.

Gathering the r-band data from the different GCNs (Butler et al. GCN19131; 
de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 19136; Jeong et al. GCN 19140; Im et al. 
GCN 19141; Klose et al. GCN 19142; de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 19143; 
Graham et al. GCN 19144; Bolmer et al. GCN 19150) the light curve seems 
to have been flat, or even increasing in brightness during the first 4-8 hrs 
after the burst. After this, the light curve begins a steep decay with 
alpha = 1.23 +/- 0.14 (F_nu ~ t^-alpha). This is not unlike the behaviour of 
other short GRBs, f.ex. GRB 130603B (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2014 
A&A 563, 62), which was interpreted as being a magnetar powered event.
