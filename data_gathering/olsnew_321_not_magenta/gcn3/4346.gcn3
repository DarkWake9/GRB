"We have observed the field covering the error box of
GRB 051211B (GCN4327) with the unfiltered CCD camera
on the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 10:01:06 UT on Dec.12 (about 12 hours after
the burst).
After co-adding a set of 10 images (10:01:06 - 10:13:59 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than 17.9 mag.
at the position reported by Klotz, A. et.al.(GCN4328)."
