V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), A.
Tohuvavohu (PSU) and S.L. Gibson report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 10 ks of XRT data for GRB 180624A (Gibson et al. GCN
Circ. 22832), from 118 s to 23.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 538 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 22835).

The late-time light curve (from T0+3.9 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.84 (+0.12, -0.11).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.472 (+/-0.025). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.53 (+/-0.11) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 4.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.08 (+0.19, -0.18)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.3 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11 (4.2 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.3 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 4.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 3.0 sigma
Photon index:	     2.08 (+0.19, -0.18)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.84, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.013 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.2 x
10^-13 (5.5 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
