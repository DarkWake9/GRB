report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:18:37.94 UT on 10 January 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140110A (trigger 411027520 / 140110263), which was

also detected by Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi et al. 2014, GCN 15714).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position. The angle 
from the Fermi LAT boresight at the time of the trigger is 34 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90) 
of about 9 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.524 s to
T0+5.764 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.61 (+0.07/-0.06) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1550 (+300/-250) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.1 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.69 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak= 1400(+290/-260)
keV, 
alpha = -0.59 (+0.08/-0.07)  and beta = -2.7 (+0.4/-1.1) .

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
