R. Chapman, N. Tanvir (U. of Hertfordshire), E. Rol, A.Levan (U. of
Leicester), R. Priddey (U. of Hertfordshire), I. Steele, R. Smith,
C. Mundell and M. Bode (Liverpool John Moores University) report on
behalf of the ROBONET collaboration:

The Swift/BAT error circle of GRB 050505 (GCN3360) was observed in
R-band starting May 6.30 UT with the 2m Faulkes Telescope North on
Haleakala.  Several short exposures were combined and reveal a source
at the position of the candidate optical counterpart from GCN3366.

Preliminary photometry relative to USNO-B1 stars in the frame provides
a magnitude of R = 21.5 +/- 0.2 for this source.

Further observations are planned.
