P. B. Cameron (Caltech) reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie
collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB050730 (GCN 3704) with the Very Large Array
at 8.5 GHz beginning August 2.03 UT. We detect a radio source consistent
with the optical source (GCN 3705) with position

RA(J2000):   14:08:17.11 +/-  0.01
DEC(J2000): -03:46:17.2  +/-  0.2

and flux density 145 +/- 28 uJy. Further observations are planned.
