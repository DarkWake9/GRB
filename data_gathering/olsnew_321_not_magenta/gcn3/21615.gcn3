and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170816A (Roberts et al., GCN Circ. 21504; Kozlova et al.,
GCN Circ. 21517) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 14:23:03.81 on 16 August 2017.  The burst signal was clearly seen by the SGM
instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a bright single peak.  The emission starts at
T+0.1 sec, peaks at T+0.3 sec and ends at T+0.5 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 0.25 +- 0.13 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
