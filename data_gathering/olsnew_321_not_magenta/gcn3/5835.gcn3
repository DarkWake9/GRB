behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:58:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
the count rate increase during entry into the SAA, and
located a marginal-significance peak in the resulting image 
(trigger=239987).  Swift slewed immediately to the derived location. 
The BAT light curve shows no significant burst activity overlying 
the particle background increase. 

The XRT began observing the field at 08:59:31 UT, 74 seconds after the
BAT trigger. The XRT centroided on a cosmic ray in the image. The quicklook
downlinked image shows no evidence for a source in 3s of data.
