GRB 120118B  : Lulin Optical limit 

H.Y. Hsiao, Y. Urata (NCU), K.Y. Huang (ASIAA) on behalf the EAFON
cooperation:

The Lulin 1-m telescope at Taiwan started optical observations on 
GRB 120118B at 1.8 hours after the BAT trigger (Littlejohns et al. GCN
12852). No optical counterpart was found at the Swift-XRT position
(Osborne et al, GCN 12857). Our stacked images indicate 3-sigma
limiting magnitudes of g'~21.9, r'~ 21.4 and i'~ 20.9. The
calibrations were against two nearby sdss stars.
