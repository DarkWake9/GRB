D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC), A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, 
DARK/NBI), M. Blazek, C. Thoene, J. F. Agui Fernandez (all 
HETH/IAA-CSIC), A. Moreno, and H. Vasquez Ramio (both CEFCA) report:

We observed the LAT position of the bright GRB 200613A (Fermi-LAT 
detection: Ohno et al. GCN #27931, Fermi GBM detection: Bissaldi & 
Lesage, GCN #27930) with the T80 0.8m telescope at the Observatorio de 
Javalambre (Teruel, Spain). Observations consisted of 3 x 300 s in g', 3 
x 300 s in r', and 5 x 180 s in i'.

At the position of the second reported XRT source, we detect an optical 
source not seen to several magnitudes deeper in PanSTARRS archival 
imaging. The source is detected in each frame. The position is RA 
(J2000) = 10:12:10.08, Dec. (J2000) = 45:54:14.26 with an estimated 
error of 0".5. There is also a cataloged SDSS source nearby at RA 
(J2000) = 10:12:10.075, Dec. (J2000) = 45:54:12.88, this may be the host 
galaxy of the GRB, though we note nothing is detected here in the 
PanSTARRS image.

Further analysis is in progress. Spectroscopic observations are 
encouraged.
