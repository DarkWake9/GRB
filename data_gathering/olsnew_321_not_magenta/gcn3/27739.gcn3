report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:


We observed ZTF20aazpphd (AT2020jww) reported by (T. Ahumada et al., GCN
27737, S. J. Smartt et al., GCN 27738) with 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. We
obtained g band exposures starting at UT 20-05-14T17:22:52. The transient
was reported in GCN 27737 as a followup of the GRB200514B event detected by
Fermi GBM (GCN 27736).


We obtained the following photometric results:-

------------------------------------------------------------------

 MJD(Start)| T-T0(hrs) | Exposure(sec) | Filter | Mag |

------------------------------------------------------------------

 58983.724 |  8.25 | 600 | g | 19.20 +/- 0.04 |

 58983.732 |  8.44 | 600 | g | 19.15 +/- 0.04|

 58983.863 | 11.58 | 500 | g | 19.12 +/- 0.05 |

------------------------------------------------------------------

The transient is not fading like a GRB afterglow as per our observation in
the g band. Hence, seems unrelated to the GRB200514B event.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
