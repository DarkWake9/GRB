SAO RAS) report on behalf of the GRB follow-up team:

We observed the field of GRB 141028A (Bissaldi et al., GCN 16969)
with the SAO RAS 1-m telescope Zeiss-1000 on October, 29. The observations
were started at 18:09:57 UT, ended at 19:40:42. We obtained 14 x 300 sec.
images in the Rc filter.

The OT discovered by the MASTER team (Gorbovskoy et al., GCN 16972)
and observed by numerous telescopes is clearly detected in our stacked
frame. The magnitude of OT is R = 20.6 +/- 0.1 in 8 hours since the Fermi
trigger (in Vega system, not corrected for the Milky Way extinction). The
photometry is based on the nearby USNO-B1 stars and checked with the other
catalogues.

On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Zeiss-1000 telescope
we would like to thank our colleagues S.V. Drabek, V.V. Komarov,
V.S. Shergin and V.V. Vlasyuk who have modernized the telescope control
system and provided its reliable operation.
