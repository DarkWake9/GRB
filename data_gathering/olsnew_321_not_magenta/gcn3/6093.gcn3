E. Klunko (ISTP), V. Kouprianov (GAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI), V.Rumyantsev
(CrAO) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the error box of GRB070208 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 6074) with
1.5m telescope of Sayan Observatory (Mondy)  in R-bands on Feb.08 between
(UT) 15:43 and 19:28. Series of 300 s exposures were taken under not optimal
weather conditions. We detect fading source (Guidorzi et al., GCN 6077, Fox
et al., GCN 6078, Bloom et al., GCN 6079) contaminated by nearby galaxy
(Mirabal & Halpern, GCN 6075). Detailed photometry will be done after
additional observation of the galaxy.
