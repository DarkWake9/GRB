Y.-D. Hu, A. Sota, A. J. Castro-Tirado, E. Fernandez-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of SGR 1830-0645/GRB201010A by Swift (Page et al. GCNC 28594), optical images in the I-band were obtained at the 1.5m OSN telescope in Granada (Spain) starting at 20:35 (Oct 10), i.e. ~5.8 h postburst. No optical afterglow is detected in the image within the enhanced Swift/XRT error box (Osborne et al. GCNC 28596) down to I=20.1, which is in agreement with the non-detections reported by Lipunov et al. (GCNC 28595) and Belkin et al. (GCNC 28597).

We thank the staff at OSN for their excellent support.
