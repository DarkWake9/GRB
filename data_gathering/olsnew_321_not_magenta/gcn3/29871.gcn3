The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 20:12:53 UT on 21 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210421C (trigger 640728778.025922 / 210421842).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 192.2, Dec = -61.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 48m, -61d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 125.0 degrees.
