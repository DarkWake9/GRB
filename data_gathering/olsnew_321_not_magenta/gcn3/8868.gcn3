TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8868
SUBJECT: GRB 090201: Swift-XRT detection of the possible X-ray afterglow

A.P. Beardmore and K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team :

The Swift-XRT started observing the field of GRB 090201 (Oates et al,
GCN Circ. 8865) in photon counting mode at 18:50:40.7UT, 63.6 minutes
after the trigger. In 1.4 ks of promptly downlinked data we detect
a source at a position of RA, Dec = 92.0530, -46.5888, which is

RA (J2000)  =   06h 08m 12.74s
Dec (J2000) =  -46d 35m 19.8s

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). The source is
55.5 arcsec from the  reported BAT position and within its error circle.
We do not have sufficient data at this stage to tell if the source is
fading.
