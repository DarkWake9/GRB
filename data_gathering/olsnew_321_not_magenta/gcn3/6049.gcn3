The long bright GRB 070125 (Hurley et al., GCN 6024),
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=26450.853 s UT (07:20:50.853).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows several multipeaked pulses
with a duration of ~70 s, followed by a weak tail
seen up to T-T0~200 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.74(-0.15, +0.18)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and the 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+41.472 s
2.25(-0.34, +0.36)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+75.008 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.10(-0.09, +0.10),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.08(-0.15, +0.10),
the peak energy Ep = 367(-51, +65) keV (chi2 = 88/89 dof).
Fitting by a power law with exponential cutoff model
yields much worse chi2 = 118/90 dof.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
