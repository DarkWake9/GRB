A.J. van der Horst, C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC), R.A.M.J. Wijers and
A. Kamble (Univ. of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the NGC 2770 transient (GCN 7159) at 4.9 GHz
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at January 15 19.38 UT to
January 16 7.06 UT.
We detect a source with a flux density of 369 +/- 33 microJy at the
position of the radio counterpart reported at 8.46 GHz (GCN 7178).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
