Michel Fich (U. Waterloo), Robin R. Phillips, Gerald Moriarty-Schieven, 
Remo P.J. Tilanus (JAC), Dale A. Frail (NRAO), and Ian Smith (Rice U.)
report on behalf of the Dutch and Canadian GRB collaborations:

"We used the SCUBA sub-millimeter continuum bolometer array on the
JCMT to observe the optical (GCN #962, 963, 965) and radio counterpart
(GCN #968) to GRB 010222 between 13:03 and 18:16 on 2001 February 22 UT.

We detect a source at this location with a preliminary averaged 850
micron flux density of 4.2 +/- 1.2 mJy."

Further observations are planned.
