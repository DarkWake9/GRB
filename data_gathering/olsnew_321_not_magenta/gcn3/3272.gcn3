K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports

 "The error region of GRB 050416 (Sakamoto, et al. GCN 3264) was
observed with the ART 14 inch telescope. VRcIc imaging started at
11:05:36 UT (52s after trigger) and 60s exposure was repeated.

 As a result of the preliminary analyses, the optical afterglow (Cenko 
and Fox GCN 3265; Anderson, et al. GCN 3266) is not detected in our
frames and the following upper limit is derived relative to USNO-A2.0
(R) magnitude.

Start(UT) Magnitude Exposure
