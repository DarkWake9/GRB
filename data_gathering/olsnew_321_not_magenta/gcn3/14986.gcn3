The long GRB 130702A (= Fermi 394416326; Optical and X-ray transient 
discovery:  Singer et al., GCN 14967; Fermi-LAT detection: Cheung et 
al., GCN 14971; Fermi GBM detection: Collazzi & Connaughton, GCN 14972; 
IPN localization: Huley et al., GCN 14974) was detected by Konus-Wind in 
the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a FRED-like pulse with a duration of ~26 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
6.70(-0.80,+0.82)10^-6 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(GBM)-2.8 s
to T0(GBM)+23.7 s) by a simple power-law model yields a power law index 
of 1.87 +/- 0.11.

Assuming z = 0.145 (Kasliwal et al., GCN 14985; Leloudas et al. GCN
14983) and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M =
0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso =
6.36(-1.03,+1.34)x10^50 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame
extrapolating the best power-law function fit.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
The results presented above are preliminary.
