We have observed the entire preliminary IPN
error box for GRB 000408 (GCN#626) as well
as the refined error box (GCN#632)
from several sites and on both available nights.
Because of the shape of the error box, mosaics were
used at each site, limiting the depth of exposure
for any particular field.  Only R-band observations
were made.  A log of the observations is given below.

POSS-II/F for this field is not available through
DSS.  However, it is available through the USNO
PMM pixel database.  We have placed three files
on the anon ftp server that cover the error box:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000408-1.jpg
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000408-2.jpg
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000408-3.jpg
in order of increasing RA.  A finder chart from POSS-I
with the refined error box marked on it is at:
http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb000408/grb000408.dss.gif

No candidate was found above the POSS-II plate limit.
The two deep exposure sets from USNO were blinked
to look for transients below the POSS-II plate
limit.  While several candidates are present,
none is entirely convincing at a limiting
magnitude of approximately R=21.5.  However, for
completeness, here are the two best candidates
inside the error box, both R=20.5 or fainter:
A  09:11:04.82  +66:33:31.3  J2000
B  09:08:51.36  +66:33:36.5  J2000 

Preliminary BVRI all-sky calibration of the central
part of the error box can be found at
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000408.dat
The external zero-point errors for this file are estimated
to be +/- 0.05mag.  Refinement of this photometry
will be performed in late April if an OT is discovered.

Further data analysis is in progress.
