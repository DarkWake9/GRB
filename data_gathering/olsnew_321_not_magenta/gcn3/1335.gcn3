A. Gal-Yam, E. O. Ofek and Y. Lipkin (Wise Observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the center of the error box of GRB 020405 using
the Wise Observatory 1m telescope + Tek CCD camera at 2002 Apr 05.95 UT.
Three 900 s R-band images were obtained. We identify the candidate OT
proposed by Price et al. (GCN 1326) for which we measure an R-band
magnitude of 18.8 +/- 0.14 mag, using the R=17.8 mag reference star from 
Hjorth et al. (GCN 1329). Our measured value seems to agree better 
with those of Price et al. (GCN 1333) than those of Hjorth et al. 
(GCN 1329).
