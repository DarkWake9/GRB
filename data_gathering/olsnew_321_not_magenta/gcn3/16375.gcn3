report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 16:31:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140610A (trigger=601259).  Swift will have a delayed slew
due to the Earth observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 286.260, +3.907, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 05m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 54' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a long peak
with a duration of at least 110 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+49.4
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

As the XRT is currently in Manual State due to an anomaly there will be
no prompt data products for this burst once Swift slews. The XRT is still 
collecting data, and the usual automated analyses will be available once the
data are on the ground. The XRT GCN circulars will be produced, once manual
verification has taken place due to the uncertain calibration of XRT in
its anomaly state. Please see GCN Circ. 16356 for details. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
