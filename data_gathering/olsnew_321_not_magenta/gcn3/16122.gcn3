D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 140419A (Marshall et al., GCN 16118) 
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy at a mean 
frequency of 93 GHz starting at 05:23:45, 77 minutes after the GRB 
trigger.

In the first hour of observations, we marginally detect a weak source 
consistent with the location of the optical afterglow (Zheng et al., GCN 
16119; Guver et al., GCN 16120) with a flux of approximately 1.5 mJy. 
Observations are continuing.

We thank J. Carpenter and D. Segura-Cox for assistance with rapidly 
scheduling and executing the observations.
