D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and M. H. Siegel (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Due to a known race condition in the Swift software,
an image peak was misidentified as a rarely-seen source. 
It was, however, correctly identified on the ground as 
4U 1700-377, at a flux level that is often seen for this source. 

Thus this detection is not an interesting event.
