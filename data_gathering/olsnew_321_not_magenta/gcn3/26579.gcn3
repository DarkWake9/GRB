The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:25:16 UT on 25 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191225A (trigger 598951521.49675 / 191225309).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 95.5, Dec = -17.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 21m, -17d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
