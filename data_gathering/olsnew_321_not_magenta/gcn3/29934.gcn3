Following the detection of GRB 210504A by Swift (Beardmore et al. GCNC 29929), we use Antarctic Survey Telescope 3-3 at YaoAn Astronomy Observation (China, Yunnan) for follow-up. Our observation started on 2021-05-04T16:02:29.850 (about 2 hours after the trigger of BAT, according to Lien et al. GCNC 29930). No optical source was detected within the XRT error box down to 21.0 +/- 0.6 mag in the coadded image (total 2100s, g-band). Our non-detection result is consistent with the UVOT (Beardmore et al. GCNC 29929), MASTER (Lipunov et al. GCNC 29931), and the BOOTES-4/ MET (Hu et al. GCNC 29932) limits.
