D. A. Perley, R. Chornock, and J. S. Bloom report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

Starting at 09:25 UT on 2008 July 10 we began spectroscopy of the 
optical counterpart (Li et al., GCN 7959) of GRB 080710 (Sbarufatti et 
al., GCN 7957) using Gemini-South (+GMOS).  We acquired 2x1200s 
integrations using the B600 grism, covering a wavelength range from 3800 
to 6700 Angstroms.

The spectrum shows several strong absorption features, corresponding to 
the Mg II (2796+2803) doublet, Fe II (2586+2600) doublet, Mg I (2853), 
and Fe II (2344+2374+2382) at a common redshift of z=0.845.  We 
tentatively associate this redshift with GRB 080710.  Additional 
analysis of the spectrum is ongoing.

We thank the Gemini staff for conducting these observations.
