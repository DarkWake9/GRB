E. Berger, D. Kelson (Carnegie Observatories) and S. Gonzalez (Las
Campanas Observatory) report:

"We imaged a field centered on the XRT error circle (GCN 3045) of GRB
050219b (GCN 3044) with the Las Campanas Observatory's du Pont 2.5-m
telescope in the Ks-band and the Swope 40-in telescope in the R-band
(2005, Feb 20.095, 5.2 hours after the burst).  We do not detect any
bright sources within the 6.3 arcsec radius XRT error circle in either
band.  However, a faint source close to the detection limit of the Ks-band
image is located at (J2000):
        RA  = 05:25:15.21
        DEC = -57:45:10.4
about 1.3" from the nominal XRT position."
