TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  865
SUBJECT: IPN TRIANGULATION OF GRB001025B (SHORT/HARD)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 71369 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of  < 0.25 
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately 2E-07 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  8E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
whose approximate area is 110. sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  18 h 21 m 40.78 s     -5 o  8 '  34.45 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 18 h 21 m 26.96 s     -5 o  8 '  54.58 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 18 h 22 m 56.09 s     -5 o 22 '  40.46 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 18 h 20 m 26.72 s     -4 o 54 '  38.26 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 18 h 21 m 54.61 s     -5 o  8 '  14.39 " 

The duration and energy spectrum of this event place it clearly
in the short/hard category.  We add one note of caution: this
burst was detected by Ulysses with a significance of only 4.5
sigma (statistical), which is at the limit of a reliable detection.

This error box may be improved
