P. T. Boyd, and F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf 
of the Swift/UVOT team:

      The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 060714 at
15:13:49 UTC on 2006-07-14, 109 s after the BAT trigger (Krimm et al.,
GCN Circular 5311).  An optical counterpart was detected in the White
filter (160-650 nm) at a position (RA,Dec) = (227.8601, -6.5662)
(J2000) with a 90% confidence interval of 0.56 arcsec. The optical 
afterglow was detected significantly in the White, and V filters.  

      The photometry results are given for the UVOT filters below:
