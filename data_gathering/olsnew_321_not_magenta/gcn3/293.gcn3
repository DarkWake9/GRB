Bradley E. Schaefer (Yale) reports:

"I have obtained two 15-minute R band observations of the joint RXTE/IPN
region for GRB990506 (with the 5.1' RXTE position) starting at 23:20 UT 6
May 1999 (less than 12 hours after the burst) with the Yale 1.0 m
telescope on Cerro Tololo. In a comparison with the the Digital Sky
Survey, no new sources were seen to the DSS limit, nor is any obvious
change visible between the images. We are continuing observations. 
Detailed analysis and deeper images/comparisons might yet yield a
counterpart."
