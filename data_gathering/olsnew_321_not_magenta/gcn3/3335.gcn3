" We have observed the position of GRB 050502a optical afterglow (Yost
et al. GCN 3322) using 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory,
Taiwan. Under unstable weather condition, single R band image was
taken at 15.59 UT (~ 13.37 hours after the burst). The limiting
magnitude is R~ 21 compared with USNO-B1.0 stars. No source was
detected down to the limiting magnitude at the position.
