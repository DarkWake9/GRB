O.J. Roberts (UCD) and C.Meegan (UAH) report on
behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:54:57.83 UT on 06 October 2015, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located
GRB 151006A (trigger 465818101/151006413), which
was also detected by Swift BAT and XRT
(Kocevski et al. 2015, GCN 18398). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM
trigger time using the Swift position is 30 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a FRED-like peak
with a duration (T90) of about 84 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+83.7 s
is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 227 +/- 53 keV,
alpha = -1.17 +/- 0.07, and beta = -1.68 +/- 0.04

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval
is (1.15 +/- 0.02)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+5.24 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 4.9 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
