A. Melandri, S.Covino, D. Fugazza, P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OAB), on behalf of the REM team, report:


We observed the field of GRB200205A (Evans et al. GCN 26982) with the REM 60cm robotic telescope located at the ESO premise of La Silla (Chile). The observations were performed starting from about 6 min after the event and were carried in the g, r, i, z bands. 

The optical counterpart (Lipunov et al. GCN 2698) is detected in all the optical bands. A preliminary photometry gives:

R = 16.3 +/- 0.1
I = 16.8 +/- 0.1

at 19 min from the GRB time. Magnitudes are calibrated against the USNO-B1 catalogue.
