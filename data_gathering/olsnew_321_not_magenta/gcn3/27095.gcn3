on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

An updated skymap from the bilby pipeline (Ashton et al., 2019) was released for the gravitational-wave trigger S200213t (LVC, GCN #27042). We previously reported observations performed with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the Zwicky Transient Facility camera (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) in Kasliwal et al., GCN #27051. The updated ZTF coverage based on the bilby skymap is 81%.

Several candidates discovered with ZTF were previously reported (Kasliwal et al., GCN #27051; Andreoni et al., GCN #27065; Reusch et al., GCN #27068), most of which were spectroscopically classified as transients unrelated to S200213t (Valeev et al., GCN #27060; Castro-Tirado et al., GCN #27063; Ho et al., GCN #27074; Andreoni et al., GCN #27075).

Candidates that require spectroscopic follow-up and are included in the 95% probability area of the bilby skymap are listed in the table below.
