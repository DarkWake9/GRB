M. Bayliss, J. Haislip, A. Foster, D. Reichart report on behalf of the UNC
team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

The PROMPT-5 telescope automatically responded to HETE2-SXC alert
3862 for GRB 050709 and imaged the field for 3600s in Rc beginning
approximately 27 hours after the time of the GRB.  Preliminary analysis
reveals no new source down to the limit of the DSS.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
