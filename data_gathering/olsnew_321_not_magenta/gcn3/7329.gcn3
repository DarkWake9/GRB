The 3 automatic 0.5-m telescopes of the TAOS (Taiwan American
Occultation Survey, located at Lulin Observatory) started to observe
GRB 071010B at 52s after the burst. The afterglow (Kann et al. GCN
6884) was detected in our 5s and 25s images.  Due to twilight, the
TAOS telescopes stopped taking images around 4 minutes after the
burst. The afterglow, did not show significant decay but a mild increase
during our observations. Our high resolution data and other measurements
within 2 days indicate that GRB 071010B is composed of a slightly early
brightening behavior and a shollow decay (Wang et al.). We note that
special filter (5000-7200 A) was used in TAOS telescopes.
