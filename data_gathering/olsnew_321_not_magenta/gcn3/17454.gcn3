S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have obtained further imaging of the field the Swift GRB 150212A (Page et al., 17449) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  The candidate afterglow we previously identified (GCN 17451) has remained at a constant brightness over the course of the last hour, and is well offset from the candidate XRT afterglow (Evans et al., GCN 17452).  Further inspection of archival catalogs indicates this object is likely to be a high proper motion star.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
