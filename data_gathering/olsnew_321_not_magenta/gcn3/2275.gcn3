GRB 030528: Infrared Observations and the Proposed IR Counterpart

M. Bogosavljevic, A. Mahabal, and S. G. Djorgovski (Caltech),
report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

On June 3, 2003, 08:30 UT we observed the field of the tentative
near-IR afterglow of GRB 030528 (Greiner et al, GCN 2271), using
the WIRC camera at the Palomar 200-inch Hale telescope.  A total
of 30 min on-source exposure was obtained in the Ks band. The
average seeing was ~1.0". 

The proposed afterglow of GRB 030528, Chandra source #1 
(CXOU J170400.3-223710, Butler et al., GCN 2269) is not detected
down to our 3-sigma detection limit of Ks~19.5, indicating a
continued fading (see Greiner et al, GCN 2271), and strengthening
its interpretation as the afterglow of GRB 030528.

Our 8x8 arcmin FOV also covers Chandra sources #4, #9, #10, all
of which are within the SXC revised error region.  All three are
detected.  IR images and magnitude estimates will be placed at:

The field also includes Chandra sources #3, #5, #8, #14, #15 and
#17, from the additional list outside the SXC error region
(Butler et al., GCN 2269 and ref. therein).
