Z.P. Zhu (NAOC, HUST), X. Liu, S.Y. Fu, D. Xu (NAOC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCN 28632; Kennea 
et al., GCN 28635) using the Xinglong-2.16m telescope equipped with the 
BFOSC. Observations were carried out starting at 10:35:46 UT on 
2020-10-16 (i.e., about 11.2 hr after the BAT trigger), and 13x300s 
R-band frames were obtained.

The GRB optical afterglow (e.g., Lipunov et al., GCN 28633; Malesani et 
al., GCN 28637; Ackley et al., GCN 28639; Hu et al., GCN 28645; Zhu et 
al., GCN 28653; Belkin et al., GCN 28673; Jelinek et al., GCN 28664; 
Marshall et al., GCN 28662; Belkin et al., GCN 28656; Grossan et al., 
GCN 28674) is weakly detected in our stacked image, with R = 22.0 +/- 
0.3 at T-mid=12.10 hr, calibrated with the nearby Pan-STARRS field.

We acknowledge the support of the staff of the Xinglong-2.16m telescope, 
in particular J. Zheng and A.Y. Zhou.
