The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:10:54 UT on 25 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220525A (trigger 675130259.241452 / 220525008).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 14.9, Dec = 18.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 59m, 18d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 58.0 degrees.
