Russian space mission "Lomonosov" (*) ( http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/en/ ) 
was launched 28.04.2016 from new Russian Kosmodrom  "Vostochny" to polar 
solar-synchronous orbit with altitude ~490 km. Scientific program of
"Lomonosov" includes a multi-wavelength GRB study at different time 
scales. In particular the complex study of prompt emission will be 
provided based on the direct  recording of readings of wide field optical 
cameras as well as on the fast pointing of optical and 
UV telescope using its moving mirror. The spacecraft "Lomonosov" contains 
3 instruments for GRB  study: gamma-ray burst monitor BDRG 
( http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/en/scientific-equipment-2/bdrg ), a wide 
field optical camera SHOK ( http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/en/scientific-equipment-2/shok 
) and UFFO ( http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/en/scientific-equipment-2/uffo )
instrument consisting of coding mask X-ray telescope UBAT and UV slewing
mirror telescope SMT.

The Lomonosov GRB monitor BDRG is designed to obtain temporal and spectral 
information about GRBs in energy range 10-3000 keV as well as to produce 
GRB trigger.

The trigger is used onboard to fix some amount of data before GRB stored 
in the internal memory of all instruments of GRB complex as well as to 
start the detailed data collection. Immediately after the trigger the
onboard estimation of the GRB position starts. Then the telegram with 
trigger information is sent via Global Star transmitter to the server in 
MSU and, after automatic ground-based data processing (to exclude 
radiation belt zones etc.) to GCN (this will be  realized sometime later
after optimizing the trigger parameters during flight tests).

There are 3 GRBs and 5 SGR outbursts are detected to the present BDRG GRB 
monitor, which were also detected by other space missions and presented in 
GCN:
