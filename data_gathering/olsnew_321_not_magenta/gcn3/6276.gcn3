D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and H. Uthars (NOT) report:

We observed the field of GRB 070412 (Romano et al., GCN 6273) using the
NOT + ALFOSC in the R and i bands. Inside the XRT error circle, we detect
a source at the detection limit (R = 24 +- 0.3) at the following
coordinates:

alpha = 12:06:10.83
delta = 40:08:27.8

The source is only detected in the (deeper) R-band frame. No other source
is deteted inside the XRT error circle fown to R~24.1. The observation was
carried out 56 min after the trigger.

Given the large size of the error box (5.6"), we cannot assess whether
this source is associated to the GRB. We note however the lack of bright
objects inside the XRT circle.

Further observations are underway.
