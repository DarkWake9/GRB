report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:25:26.968 UT on 20 February 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160220A (trigger 477624330 / 160220059), which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Lien et al. 2016, GCN 19023).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 46
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 9 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.072 s to T0+9.216 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.5 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.2 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.43 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
