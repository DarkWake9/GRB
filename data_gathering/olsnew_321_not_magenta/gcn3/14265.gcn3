TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14265
SUBJECT: GRB 130305A: P60 Observations
DATE:    13/03/06 19:51:49 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the location of the Swift (Cummings et al., GCN 14257), Fermi
(Guiriec et al., GCN 14260; Yu et al., GCN 14261), and Konus (Golenetskii
et al., GCN 14262) GRB 130305A with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.
Observations were obtained in the g', r', and i' filters beginning at 2:47
UT on 2013 Mar 6 (~ 15.1 hr after the Swift-BAT trigger).

We do not detect any sources within the Swift-XRT error circle (Malesani
et al., GCN 14263) in any filter.  Using nearby point sources from SDSS
for reference, we calculate limiting magnitudes of g' > 22.8, r' > 22.2,
and i' > 21.7 at this time.
