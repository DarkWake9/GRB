SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G270580: Liverpool Telescope classification of EM candidates

FROM:    Chris Copperwheat at LJMU ArI  <c.m.copperwheat@ljmu.ac.uk>

From C.M. Copperwheat (LJMU), A.S. Piascik (LJMU), D.Steeghs (Warwick)
and I.A. Steele (LJMU) on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of
EM candidates reported to the collaboration in GCN 20518. Observations
were made with the SPRAT spectrograph, and supernova classifications
were obtained using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

PS17wt was observed on 2017-01-25 at 00:30 UT. Possibly some faint
emission features - no clear evidence of transient distinct from host
galaxy emission.

PS17yt was observed on 2017-01-25 at 01:50 UT. The spectrum is
consistent with a SN Type Ia at 9 days before peak, with z=0.069.
Galaxy 2MASX J10035883+4902195 is at a 0.211 arcmin separation, and
has catalogue z=0.069742. The classification of this object as a Type
Ia is consistent with GCN 20521, which reports spectroscopic data
obtained an hour prior to our observation.

PS17tn was observed on 2017-01-25 at 02:37 UT. The spectrum is
consistent with a SN Type Ia at 2 days before peak, with z=0.040.
Galaxy 2MASX J09431321+4118581 is at a 0.099 arcmin separation, and
has catalogue z=0.044759.

PS17ua was observed on 2017-01-25 at 03:12 UT. The spectrum is
consistent with a SN Type Ia at 1 day before peak, with z=0.048.
Galaxy 2MASX J09441179+3250341 is at a 0.102 arcmin separation, and
has catalogue z=0.045336.

PS17of was observed on 2017-01-25 at 03:49 UT. The spectrum is
consistent with a SN Type II at 15 days after peak, with z=0.031.
