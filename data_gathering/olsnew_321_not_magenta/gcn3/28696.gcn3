Observatory Team:

At 05:47:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201020A (trigger=1000926).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 261.246, +31.425 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 24m 59s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 25' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~17 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 05:49:47.6 UT, 141.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 261.2279,
31.4288 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 24m 54.71s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 25' 43.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 57 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 3.70
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 144 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	17:24:54.67 = 261.22779
  DEC(J2000) = +31:25:42.0  =  31.42834
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.62 arc sec. This position is 5.4
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
18.14 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.15. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.04.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
