D. Fugazza, P. D'Avanzo, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), L. A. Antonelli (INAF-OAR/ASI-ASDC) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 120119A (Beardmore et al., GCN 12859) with the REMIR infrared camera, mounted on the 60-cm robotic REM telescope at
La Silla, starting 2.5 min after the burst.

The optical/NIR afterglow (Beardmore et al. GCN 12859; Morgan & Bloom GCN 12860; Gomboc GCN 12861; Schady et al. GCN 12863; Elenin et al. GCN 12871; Cobb GCN 12878) is clearly detected in the H-band. 
The light curve shows a plateau from about 4.5 min to 10 min after the burst with an observed magnitude of H~13.4, peaks at about T-T0=15 min with H~13.0 and then displays a significant decay. 
The last detection is at T-T0=3.8 hr with a magnitude of H~16.0.


The magnitudes are calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue.
