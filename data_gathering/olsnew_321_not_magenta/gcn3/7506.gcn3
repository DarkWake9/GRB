Alicia Soderberg (Princeton),  Poonam Chandra (U. Virginia), and Dale
Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 080319B (GCN 7427) with the Very 
Large Array beginning at Mar 21.56 UT.  At 4.86 GHz we detect a radio 
source coincident with the optical afterglow position (GCN 7428) at
coordinates (J2000):

RA =  14 31 41.01   +/-  0.05
Dec = 36 18 09.7    +/-   0.4

with flux density 189 +- 39 microJy.  Further observations are scheduled.

Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
