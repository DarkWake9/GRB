We observed the field of GRB 141015A detected by Swift (trigger #615399; 
Troja et al., GCN Circ. 16909) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T05 (0.25 m Takahashi Epsilon) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory 
(NM, USA).  

20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the Red filter starting from October 15 
09:37:23 (UT) about 26 minutes after the trigger and stopped on October 5 10:04:00 (UT).  
We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked 
image at the enhanced X-ray afterglow position (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 16913).  
The estimated five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec) 
is ~17.1 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
