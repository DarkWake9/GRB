P. D'Avanzo, D. Fugazza, S. Covino, A. Melandri (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of GRB 170111A (Beardmore et al., GCN 20423) with the 60-cm robotic 
telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 00:34:41 UT, 
73 seconds after the burst, and were carried out simultaneously in the g, r, i, z and H bands.

A preliminary photometry indicates that no source is detected at the X-ray afterglow position 
(Evans et al. GCN 20424) down to the following 3sigma limiting magnitudes:

r > 16.3 at T-T0 =  78s
H > 15.9 at T-T0 =  86s
r > 18.9 at T-T0 = 706s
H > 17.7 at T-T0 = 785s


Magnitudes are in the AB system and have been calibrated with respect to the 2MASS (H-band) 
and APASS (r-band) catalogues.
