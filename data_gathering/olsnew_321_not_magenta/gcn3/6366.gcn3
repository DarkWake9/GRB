P. Schady (MSSL/PSU) and C. Markwardt (GSFC/UMD) report on behalf of the 
Swift UVOT team:

Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 070429B starting 297s after the BAT 
trigger. No new source is detected either within the refined XRT position 
(GCN 6360) in any of the UVOT filters, in either single or co-added 
exposures. The 3-sigma upper limits for the co-added exposures in each 
filter are as follows:

Filter  T_mid(s) Exp.(s) Mag 3-sig UL
White    1009    302     19.68
V        1489    605     19.64
B        1812    184     19.83
U        2092    392     19.80
UVW1     1625    253     19.31
UVM2     1601    253     19.48
UVW2     1682    214     19.63

where T_mid is the weighted mid time of the co-added images. The reported 
upper limits are uncorrected for the estimated Galactic reddening of 
E(B-V) = 0.03 mag.
