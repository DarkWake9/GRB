D. A. Kann, U. Laux & R. Filgas (TLS Tautenburg) report:

During a serendipitous opening in the cloud cover, we observed the field 
of GRB 071013 (Marshall et al., GCN 6907) with the Tautenburg 1.34m 
Schmidt telescope under very good conditions, obtaining 4 300 second 
images in the Rc band at 4.2 days after the GRB, before clouds returned 
and shut us down. We use the same comparison star as given in Kann, 
Hoegner & Filgas (GCN 6917), and find the following magnitude of the 
possible variable source discovered by Kornienko et al. (GCN 6925) in a 
stacked image:

Date		Mid-Time	Rc	dRc

17.78693	4.28046		19.584	0.023

Thus, the magnitude remains unchanged in comparison to the second epoch 
(Kann et al., GCN 6926). Between 3.2 and 4.2 days, we rule out, at 3 sigma 
confidence level, any additional source (e.g., a rising SN component) 
brighter than R = 22.5.

We also analyse the Kornienko Candidate in the stacked image of our first 
epoch (Kann, Hoegner & Filgas, GCN 6917). To summarize, from the three 
stacked images, we derive the following magnitudes of the possible host 
galaxy:

Date		Mid-Time	Exposure	Rc	dRc

13.79254	0.28608		13 x 600	19.565	0.009
16.75845	3.25198		6 x 300		19.583	0.015
17.78693	4.28046		4 x 300		19.584	0.023

If the slight magnitude difference between epoch 1 and epoch 2 would be 
due to an additional source, it would have had R ~ 24 at 0.29 days. 
Assuming the detection by Kornienko et al. is real, and the "host" has R = 
19.583, the "host-corrected" magnitude of the Kornienko Candidate is R = 
18.56. The decay slope is then found to be alpha ~ 2 between 0.024 and 
0.286 days. This is steep but not completely unrealistic. We are thus 
unable to rule out that the object found by Kornienko et al. may be a 
superposed faint afterglow, although contemporary measurements (Xin et 
al., GCN 6929) do not detect it. Since Swift seems to have not slewed at 
all and no position more precise than the refined BAT error circle is 
known (Palmer et al., GCN 6911), X-ray confirmation will probably not be 
forthcoming.
