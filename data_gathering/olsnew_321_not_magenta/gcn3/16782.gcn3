V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) and A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA)  
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

XRT began a target of opportunity observation of GRB140901B, detected  
by Swift-BAT (Cummings, GCN Circ. 16773) and Fermi-GBM (Zhang, Circ.  
16775). Swift slewed to the burst on 2014-09-05.

Observations with the XRT began at 01:23:58 UT, i.e., 330 ks after the  
trigger, and comprised a total of 2.97 ks in photon counting mode.

We do not detect any X-ray sources, within the BAT error circle  
(Cummings, GCN Circ. 16773), with S/N>2. We place a 3-sigma upper  
limit on the count rate at the BAT position of 3.85E-03 cts/s.

This  circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
