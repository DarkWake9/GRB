John A. Tomsick (UC Berkeley/Space Sciences Laboratory) reports on behalf 
of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) team:

COSI is a large field of view (1/4-sky) gamma-ray (0.1-10 MeV) instrument on 
a Superpressure Balloon flight that began on May 16.  

A likely Gamma-ray Burst (GRB 160530A) was detected by COSI in both the 
cesium iodide shields and the germanium strip detectors (GeDs).  The GRB 
started at 2016 May 30, 07:03:46 UT and lasted until 07:04:23 UT (based on 
the shield rates).  During the burst, the light curve shows several large amplitude 
fluctuations.

Based on the GeD rates and assuming a Band function with alpha=1.0, 
beta=2.5, and E_break = 150 keV, we calculated a preliminary burst fluence of 
1.3E-5 erg/cm2.  This value may be revised in the future using the spectral 
capabilities of the GeDs.

The position of the GRB is R.A. = 120.2 deg, Decl. = -26.2 deg (J2000, 90% 
confidence error radius = 1.5 degrees), which corresponds to Galactic coordinates 
of l = 243.9 deg, b = 2.1 deg.  Due to the proximity to the Galactic plane, a Galactic 
origin cannot be ruled out.

We searched the SIMBAD database for possible counterparts, and three known 
gamma-ray sources are present in the COSI error region:  GRB 080516, 
2FGL J0758.0-2615c, and 3FGL J0755.2-2633 are, respectively, 0.4, 0.6, and 
1.3 degrees from the center of the COSI error circle. 

Follow-up observations with Swift/XRT are underway (see P.A. Evans et al., GCN 
Circ. 19472) to search for an afterglow that may allow us to improve the position 
and provide a definitive classification of the COSI burst.
