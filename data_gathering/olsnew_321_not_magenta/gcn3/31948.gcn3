MASTER-OAGH was the first telescope of MASTER-NET to observe IC-220425's
error-box at 2022-04-25 06:35:11 UTC, 13813 sec after the trigger
(Lipunov et al., GCN #31946).

We report on the detection of a flaring blazar TXS 1742-078 (RA=266.3629 
Dec=-7.8844).

IC-220425A is a track-like event with an estimated energy of 600 TeV and 
signalness of 17%. It was detected at 2022-04-25 02:44:58 UTC 
and is  centred at RA=268.24 (+1.98, -1.66 deg, 90% PSF containment), 
Dec=-10.73  (+1.71, -1.48 deg, 90% PSF containment) J2000(GCN #31944).

The first image of TXS 1742-078 was obtained at 2022:04-25 06:36:32 UTC. 
It is located 3.4 deg away from the center of error-box.
Based on our photometry, the blazar is currently experiencing a flaring 
episode (W=17.3+/-0.1, no correction for extinction), compared to its 
quiscence state (W=19.2+/-0.3). Judging from ATLAS observations(Smith et 
al, PASP 132, 2020)(https://fallingstar-data.com/forcedphot/queue/195704/plot.pdf) it is 
31944the brightest flare since 2017.

Interestingly enough, after the correction for galactic 
extinction(Schlafly and Finkbeiner, 2011) (A_V=3.18), magnitude of TXS 
1742-078 (W=14.1+/-0.1) is close to that of TXS 0506+056 during IC-170922A 
(W=14.3, no correction for extinction).

Judging from these facts, we highly encourage multiwavelength observations 
to determine whether or not this blazar is a source of IC-220425A

The observation and reduction will continue.
