SUBJECT: GRB 061025: ROTSE-III Optical Limits

E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), R. Quimby (U 
Texas), H. Swan (U Mich), S.A. Yost (U Mich), report on behalf of the 
ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 061025 (Integral trigger 3525, Mereghetti, et al, GCN 
5751), producing images beginning 4.6 s after the GCN notice time. An 
automated response took the first image at 18:36:46.6 UT, 44.7 s after 
the burst, under excellent conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 
31 60-sec eposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to 
USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
90% INTEGRAL error circle, for both single images and coadding into sets 
of 10; however, we are limited as the field is somewhat crowded.  We 
note that the bright elliptical galaxy NGC 6851 is in the error box. 
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 13.3-16.9; we 
set the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
