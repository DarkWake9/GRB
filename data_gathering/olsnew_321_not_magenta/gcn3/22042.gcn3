We observed the field of GRB 171020A (Page, et al., GCN 22028) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/10 22.13 to 2017/10 22.47 UTC (27.94 to
36.23 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.27 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 2.21 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

We contine to detect the optical transient (Malesani, et al., GCN 22029;
also, Moskvitin, et al., GCN 22031; Butler, et al., GCN 22037).  In
comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

 r = 23.25 +/- 0.14
 i = 23.01 +/- 0.11
 Z > 21.75
 Y > 22.05

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Compared to our observations last
night, these data suggest either a slow afterglow fade (~t^-0.2) or that
our measured flux contains flux from the GRB host galaxy.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
