TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1666
SUBJECT: Detection of activity from SGR 1900+14 with the RXTE/PCA

C. Kouveliotou, P. Woods and E. Gogus report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed SGR 1900+14 within the framework of our long-term monitoring
program of the source with RXTE/PCA on 11/01/02, starting at 00:14 UT. Our
on-source time was 9.5 ks, during which we detected 7 bursts. Unfortunately,
source XTE J1908+094, which is currently active and within the PCA field of
view, is detected at roughly four times the quiescent SGR flux intensity,
impeding the detection of pulsations from the repeater. Our results confirm
the detection of activity from the SGR reported in GCNs 1643, 1655, 1664 and
1665, and indicate that the source has entered a new active phase.
Observations at radio and IR wavelengths are strongly encouraged.
