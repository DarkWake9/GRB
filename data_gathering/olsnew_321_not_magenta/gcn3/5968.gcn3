report:

"Following the detection of GRB 061222B by SWIFT (GCN 5957), the field was
imaged with the 60-cm BOOTES-IR robotic telescope located at Observatorio
de Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain). Observations were taken in the R-band 
starting
at 04:12:44 U.T. (i.e. 102 s after the onset of the event).  On a co-add 
of several images
(30s total time) taken at 04:18:46 (464 s after the GRB trigger), the 
optical afterglow
(GCNC 5956) is detected with R = 17.7 +/- 0.5.  The high airmass (~4.3) 
prevented
taking high quality data. Further analysis is ongoing."
