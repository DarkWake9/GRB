K.V. Garimella, A.L. Homewood, D.H. Hartmann (Clemson University), and
G.D. Henson (ETSU) on behalf of the SARA Consortium and the Clemson GRB
Follow-Up Team:

We began observations of GRB 051227 (Barbier et al, GCN 4397) beginning
December 28th, 06:20:31UT and ending 07:36:35UT approximately 12 hours
after the Swift Trigger (trigger=174738).  We obtained 15 300-second
exposures in R-band with the SARA 0.9m telescope on Kitt Peak.  Coadding
all exposures and comparing with the USNO A2.0 catalog reveals no new
source down to a detection limit of R=21.55 +/- 0.20 mag.
