The Gravitationally-lensed Gravitational Wave Hunters collaboration 
report observations of strong-lensing galaxy clusters located within the 
sky localisation of the LIGO/Virgo trigger G296853 (LVC GCN Circ. 21413).

Following Smith et al. (arXiv:1707.03412) we searched the skymap for 
strong-lensing galaxy clusters that lie within the 90% credible sky 
localisation.  Abell 2895 was the closest strong-lensing galaxy cluster 
to the peak probability in the skymap.  We observed this cluster with 
MUSE on VLT on the nights of August 9, 14, and 16.  MUSE spans a 1x1 
arcminute field of view with a wavelength range of 4650-9300 Angstroms.

Analysis of these data is ongoing.  Colleagues with complementary data 
are welcome to contact us with a view to collaboration.

We thank the staff at ESO for their outstanding support of our observing 
programmes.
