We would like to make the correction to the reported trigger 
time of the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) for GRB 151225A 
(Kawakubo et al., GCN Circ. 18724).  The correct trigger time is 
19:09:09.71 UT on 25 December 2015.  We apologize for any confusion.  

We would like to thank Dmitry Svinkin for pointing this out.
