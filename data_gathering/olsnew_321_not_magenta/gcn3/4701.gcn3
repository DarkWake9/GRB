report:

"We observed the afterglow of GRB 060206 with the Kast
double spectrograph on the Shane 3-m reflector at Lick
Observatory for 6000 s starting at UT 10:11 on 6 Feb.,
under poor observing conditions.  We confirm the report
from Fynbo et al. (GCN 4692) of strong metal-line features
and a damped Lya profile centered at z = 4.048 +/- 0.001.
The absence of a Lya forest redward of 6200 Ang marks this
absorption system as the ISM of the host galaxy of GRB 060206.

A Voigt profile analysis of the Lya profile gives
log N(HI) = 20.90 +/- 0.15. The absence of a strong feature at
SII 1253 places an upper limit to the metallicity of
[S/H] < -0.9, while the detection of Fe II 1608 implies
[Fe/H] > -1.7 dex.  Finally, the rest EW of Si II 1526
(1.1 Ang) implies a velocity width for the low-ionization
species greater than 200 km/s.
