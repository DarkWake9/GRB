The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:26:01 UT on 19 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190619A (trigger 582596766.776714 / 190619018).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 349.3, Dec = 12.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 17m, 12d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.0 degrees.
