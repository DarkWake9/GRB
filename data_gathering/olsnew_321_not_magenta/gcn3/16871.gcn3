Three MASTER system telescopes (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveshchensk, Tunka and Kislovodsk have observed GRB140630A 
(Negoro et. al GCN 16855).

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the 
GRB140930A 21 sec after notice time and 6331 sec after trigger time at 
2014-09-30 16:12:34 UT in two polarizations. On our single and coadd 
images we  not found credible optical transient within MAXI error-box 
(Negoro et. al GCN 16855). The 5-sigma upper limit on single (180 s) 
images has been about 18.1 mag. The 5-sigma upper limit on coadd of 13 
image with total exposure 2340 s is about 19.5m

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the 
GRB140930A 22 sec after notice time and 6332 sec after trigger time at 
2014-09-30 16:12:35 UT in two polarizations. On our single and coadd 
images we not found credible optical transient within MAXI error-box. The 
5-sigma upper limit on single (180 s) images has been about 18.5 mag. The 
5-sigma upper limit on coadd of first 12 image with total exposure 2160 s 
is about 20.5m

MASTER II  robotic telescope  located in Tunka was pointed to the 
GRB140930A 93 sec after notice time and 6415 sec after trigger time at 
2014-09-30 16:13:58 UT in two polarizations. On our single and coadd 
images we not found credible optical transient within MAXI error-box. The 
5-sigma upper limit on single (180 s) images has been about 17.9 mag. The 
5-sigma upper limit on coadd of 13 image with total exposure 2340 s is 
about 20.0 m

The upper limits received by MASTER are given in the table below:

t_start      | t-t_mid     | exptime | filt | lim  | site | coadd
-------------+-------------+---------+------+------+------+-------
16:12:35.693 | 6485 sec    |     180 | P    | 18.5 | K    |     1
16:12:35.693 | 6485 sec    |     540 | P    | 19.5 | K    |     3
16:19:43.551 | 8075 sec    |    2160 | C    |~20.5 | K    |    12
16:12:34.498 | 6484 sec    |     180 | P    | 18.1 | B    |     1
17:20:44.913 | 12010 sec   |    2520 | C    | 19.5 | B    |    14
16:13:58.211 | 6568 sec    |     180 | P    | 17.9 | T    |     1
16:32:51.181 | 9877 sec    |    2340 | C    |~20.0 | T    |    13

Our white (clear) band is well described by a parity 0.8R+0.2B (USNO B1).
