The Fermi-LAT GRB 180703B (Racusin et al. GCN Circ. 22884) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:46:51.183 UTC on 3 July 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows two short pulses which start at T+0.1 sec,
peaks at T+1.4 sec and ends at T+2.1 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 1.4 +- 0.2 sec and 0.4 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV),
respectively.

Despite its very high brightness the burst spectrum is soft with almost
no emission seen in the CGBM data above ~500 keV. So, this is a very bright,
short, and soft GRB.
The follow-up observations of this interesting event is highly encouraged.

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
