C. Pagani reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed the Swift XRT data on the field of the AGILE detected GRB
080825B (Evangelista et al., GCN Circ. 8133), consisting of 7.5 ks of Photon
Counting data collected from T0+44 ks to T0+78 ks.

We detect a point source at the position of the optical afterglow (Thoene et
al., GCN Circ. 8135). During the XRT observations the source faded from an
initial count rate of 0.05 counts/s to a later count rate of 0.01 counts/s.

The spectrum from the PC data can be fitted by an absorbed power law model with
photon index of 2.1 and the absorption consistent with the Galactic value along
the line of sight (2.10e21 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005).  The average observed
(unabsorbed) flux of the PC mode data is 5.8e-13 (9.0e-13) ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

This Circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
