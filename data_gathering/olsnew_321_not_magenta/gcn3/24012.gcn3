report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-03-24T08:21:21.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 190324B(trigger ID: HEB190324348) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM(J. Burgess et al. ,GCN 23992).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 46.07 s measured from T0+1.05 s.
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+1.952 s, is 2937 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 30168 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
