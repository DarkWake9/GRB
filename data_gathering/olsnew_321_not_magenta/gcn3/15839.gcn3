WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 140215A (Markwardt et al.,
GCN 15837) starting at 04:09:02 UT, 112 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
V, I and clear (roughly R) filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We detect the bright optical afterglow (Markwardt
et al., GCN 15837; Cenko et al., GCN 15838) in all the individual
images. The afterglow decayed from mag~13.7 (mid t-t0=189s) to
mag~15.9 (mid t-t0=1094s) in our clear band images calibrated to
USNO B1.0 catalog. Observations are on going.
