and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:53:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160712A (trigger=704155).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to an observational constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 304.149, -26.981 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 16m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 58' 52"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a long burst with 
a duration of ~ 20 s and containing a short spike. The peak count rate 
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+47.3
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is L. M. Z. Hagen (lea.zernow.hagen AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
