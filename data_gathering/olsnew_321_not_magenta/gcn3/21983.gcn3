The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analysed offline noise-subtracted data for the LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L), and Virgo (V) detectors
around the time of the binary neutron star merger event G298048 / GW170817
(GCNs 21505, 21509, 21510, 21513, 21527) taking into account our most
up-to-date understanding of both calibration and waveform modelling
uncertainties.

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference (Veitch et al.,
PRD 91, 042003) and a new sky map, LALInference_v2.fits.gz, is available
for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G298048

The 50% and 90% credible regions span about 8 and 28 square degrees,
respectively.

This is the preferred sky map at this time, and the version that will
appear in LVC 2017 (Physical Review Letters, accepted).
