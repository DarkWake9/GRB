K. Toelge (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 160810523/492525192
at 12:33:08.74 UT on the 10th of August 2016, tentatively classified as GRB,
is in fact not due to a GRB. It is due to local particles.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
by the GBM Flight Software owing to the high fluence
of the trigger. This ARR was accepted and
the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location."
