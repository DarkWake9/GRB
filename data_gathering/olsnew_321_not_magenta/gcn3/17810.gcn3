D. Kocevski (NASA/GSFC/ORAU), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
J. L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:31:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150513A (trigger=640584).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 49.058, -22.913 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 16m 14s
   Dec(J2000) = -22d 54' 45"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 140 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 11:32 UT on 2015 May 28. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Kocevski (dankocevski AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
