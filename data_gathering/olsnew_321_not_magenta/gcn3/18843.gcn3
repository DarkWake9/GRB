LIGO/Virgo G211117: Pi of the Sky observations

On night starting 29rd of December we started observing areas connected to G211117. Due to weather conditions, observations related to  G211117 could only start on night 29th of December. We mostly focus on imaging arc spanning from 0h - 10h. Observations are made from observatory Pi of the Sky North observatory INTA. The observations are performed using cameras with wide-band White filter. Exposition time used is 10s and we take at least 10 consecutive exposures for each field, resulting in the expected limiting brightness of 12 mag. Each exposition taken cover area of approximately plus/minus 10 deg from coordinates set on center of the frame. 

For observations related to G211117 we are using following pointings (These fields cover about 30% of the area of the alert):

1) 29.9186 -19.8295
2) 35.003 19.7683
3) 143.326 76.3277
4) 8.97431 -1.97974
5) 48.9859 -1.77356
6) 56.2522 37.8203
7) 83.2047 59.9766
8) 30.9354 -1.62311
9) 33.1534 37.7411
10) 78.3588 37.7796
11) 120.202 60.2756
12) 9.18673 -20.2795

Each image taken covers approximately 400 square degrees. We are currently analyzing taken images.

If weather permits we will continue scanning this area.
