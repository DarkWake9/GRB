Optical report: observation of the SAX J0835.9+5118 field

A. Castro-Tirado (LAEFF-INTA Madrid and IAA-CSIC Granada), J. Greiner
(AIP Potsdam), S. Phleps (MPIA Heidelberg), E. Pian (ITESRE Bologna) 
and E. Costa (IAS Frascati)  report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have obtained two 20-minute R-band exposures of the 1SAX J0835.9
+5118 error box (Gandolfi et al. IAUC 7174) starting at 19:18 UT
20 May 1999 (17.25 hours after the trigger) with the 2.2 m telescope 
at the German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA). After a visual 
comparison with the the Digital Sky Survey, no new sources were seen to 
the DSS-2 limit. At the position of the radiosource reported by Frail
et al. (GCN 334) we see a point-like, faint object which is also present 
in the DSS-2, as pointed out by Bloom et al. (GCN 335). This object does
not seem to have changed significantly in brightness. 
Our frames reach significantly deeper than the DSS-2 image. If the 
above-mentioned radiosource is not the counterpart to the SAX source, 
a more detailed analysis and comparison with deeper images in the next 
few days might yield a counterpart."
