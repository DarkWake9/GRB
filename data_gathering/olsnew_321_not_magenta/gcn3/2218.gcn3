NUMBER:  2218
SUBJECT: GRB030429, refiend optical brightness

V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), V.Biryukov (SAI, MSU), A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have performed PSF analysis of combined  image of the OT found by A.
Gilmore (GCN 2184). The unfiltered image was obtained on Apr. 29 between
(UT) 18:19 and 20:57 (GCN 2190). Based on field photometry (R-band) by
A.Henden (GCN 2214) we estimate brightness of the OT:

Mid.Time     exposure  mag (Unfiltered)
  (UT)         sec

Apr.29.820   39x120    20.20 +/-0.15

This brightness estimation is consistent with OT decay slope ~ 1 reported by
J.Fynbo (GCN 2185).

(We gratefully acknowledge the notion of J.Fynbo regarding the slope decay
reported in our GCN 2190. Due to typo the slope decay was erroneously
calculated as 2)
