D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA/CSIC and DARK/NBI), P. 
Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), and J. Telting (NOT) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150213B (Pagani et al., GCN 17464) with the 
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. 
Observations started on Feb 14.22 UT (6.86 hr after the GRB), and 
consisted of 4x300 s exposures in the SDSS r filter.

The optical afterglow (Pagani et al., GCN 17464; Kann et al., GCN 17465) 
is well detected in our images. A preliminary analysis yields a 
magnitude r = 22.10 +- 0.05 (AB), calibrated against nearby SDSS stars.
