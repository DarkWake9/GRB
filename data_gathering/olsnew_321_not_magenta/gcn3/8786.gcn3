D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), C. Ferrigno,
V.Beckmann, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at
16:20:36 UT on January 7th. The refined coordinates (J2000)  are:

RA = 284.8075 [degrees]
DEC= 59.5924 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of
about 1.6 ph/cmsq/s (1-s integration time) and a fluence over the  
same energy
range of about 1.5e-6 erg/cmsq. Both values have to be considered  
lower limits,
since the burst is affected by telemetry saturation.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
