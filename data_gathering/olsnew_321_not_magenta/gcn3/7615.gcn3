A. Cucchiara and D. B. Fox (Penn State) with S. B. Cenko (Caltech),
report on behalf of a larger collaboration: 

"Starting on 2008 April 13.41 UT we observed GRB 080413B (Stamatikos
et al. GCN 7598) with the GMOS spectrograph on the Gemini South
telescope.  We obtained a single 900-sec spectrum in the wavelength
range 3900-6700A.  The resolution of our spectrum is 5 Ang/pixel (R ~
1100 at 5900A).  We clearly observe several metal absorption features
corresponding to the MgII doublet (2796,2803 A), MgI (2853A), FeII
(2586A and 2600A), and FeI (3021A). These identifications are
consistent with a host galaxy redshift of z = 1.10, confirming the
result reported from VLT observations by Vreeswijk et al.(GCN 7601)."
