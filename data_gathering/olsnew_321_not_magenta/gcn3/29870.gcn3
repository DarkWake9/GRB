The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely short GRB

At 10:54:44.812 UT on 21 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 210421B (trigger 640695289 /
210421455).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 272.1, Dec = 57.2(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 08m,
57d 09'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
