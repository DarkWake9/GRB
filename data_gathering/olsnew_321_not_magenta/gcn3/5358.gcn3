E. Semkov (IA, BAS) on behalf of the BAS/CNRS collaboration report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060218 (SN 2006aj) six months after the 
burst. Observations were made with the 2m RCC telescope at the National 
Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria) on July 24 (UT=01h). The 
calibration was made using comparison stars from Hicken et al. (GCN 
4898) and Modjaz et al. (astro-ph/0603377). Observations were made under 
good atmospheric conditions, but through high airmass (>2.5). A standard 
Johnson-Cousins set of filters was used.

The optical counterpart was detected at the following magnitudes:
I=19.53 (+/-0.07), R=19.97 (+/-0.09)
