A. S. Moskvitin, O. I. Spiridonova (SAO RAS)
on behalf of GRB follow-up team report.

We observed the field of the GRB 201229A (B. Sbarufatti et al.,
GCN #29192) with the SAO RAS 1m telescope Zeiss-1000 equipped
with CCD photometer on December 30, 00:43:31 -- 01:40:03 UT
(T_mid - T0 = 0.59186 days).

The possible OT reported by Swift team is clearly detected
in the stacked 6 x 300 sec. Rc band image with the coordinates
R.A. = 14:02:45.38, Dec. = +48:11:53.5 +/- 0".1 (J2000).
Preliminary photometry of the object is R = 21.29 +/- 0.1
(based on R2 magnitudes of nearby USNO-B1 stars).
Using UVOT and NEXT-0.6m results (S.Y. Fu et al., GCN# 29203)
we confirm the GRB OT.
