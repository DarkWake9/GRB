NUMBER:  2838
SUBJECT: GRB041211: P60 optical imaging

Derek B. Fox reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
collaboration:  

"We have imaged the 80-arcsec radius SXC error circle of GRB041211
(HETE 3622) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope, in a single
120-second exposure in Gunn i band at mean epoch 13:40:35 UT on
2004-12-11.  To a limiting equivalent magnitude of R~19 mag we detect
no new objects by reference to the Digitized Sky Survey (second
epoch).

Comparison of contemporaneous imaging of most of the rest of the
16-arcmin radius WXM error circle to the DSS has also not yielded any
optical afterglow candidates to this point."
