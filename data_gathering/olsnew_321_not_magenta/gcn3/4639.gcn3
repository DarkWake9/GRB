B. Schmidt (ANU), Edo Berger (OCIW), Yuko Kakazu (IfA), Len Cowie (IfA) 
and Brad Cenko (CalTech) on behalf of a larger collaboration report,

"We have imaged the field GRB060202 (Fox et al., GCN 4629) with Gemini-N 
+ NIRI in J, H, and K_s filters at  approximately UT 06:30, 2006 Feb 
03.   We confirm the faint source of Cenko et al. (GCN 4636) and Wang et 
al. (GCN 4637) inside the revised 4" XRT error circle (Morris et al., 
GCN 4632) in K-band images. We marginally detect the source in J.  Using 
the 2MASS star at  RA=2:23:26.6 DEC=38:23:29 (J2000), we estimate the  
magnitude of the source in a 1" aperture to be
J = 23.0 ± 0.4
H >= 21.1
K = 20.1 ± 0.2
These observations, combined with the results of Cenko et al. and Wang 
et al. indicate that GRB060202 is most likely at z<6.

We would like to thank the Staff of Gemini for their help in executing 
these Target of Opportunity observations"
