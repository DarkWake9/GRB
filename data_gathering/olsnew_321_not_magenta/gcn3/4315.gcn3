At 05:46:21 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 051210 (trigger=171931).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA,Dec 330.197d,-57.634d {22h 00m 47s,-57d 38' 01"} (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows two ~1-sec peaks with a total duration of ~6 sec.
The peak count rate was ~2200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec
after the trigger.

XRT began observing the field at 05:47:40.40, 79.2 sec after the BAT trigger.
Onboard centroiding found a bright fading uncatalogued X-ray source
in the field of view at the following coordinates:
RA(J2000):   22h 00m 41.7s
Dec(J2000):  -57d 36' 48.2"
We estimate the uncertainty of this position to be 6 arcsec (radius,
90% containment).  This position is 84 arcsec from the BAT position above.
The source initial flux is 9.7e-10 erg/cm2/sec.

The UVOT data products were delayed and the results will be forthcoming
in a second Circular.
