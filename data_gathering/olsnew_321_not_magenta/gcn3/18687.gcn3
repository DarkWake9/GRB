(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the MAXI-detected
burst GRB 151212A (Nakahira et al. GCN Circ. 18685) in a series of
observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 1.3 ks,
distributed over 7 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location
was 437 s. The data were collected between T0+8.4 ks and T0+8.6 ks, and
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected and is above the RASS limit,
and is therefore likely the GRB afterglow.  The position of this source
is RA, Dec=68.1521, -3.9615 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 04:32:36.50
Dec(J2000): -03:57:41.3

with an uncertainty of 5.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 11.5 arcmin from the MAXI position.  We cannot determine at
the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00050/index_1.php.
The results of the full analysis of the tiled XRT observations are
