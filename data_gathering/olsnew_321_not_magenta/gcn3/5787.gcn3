SUBJECT: GRB 061007: Third Epoch ATCA Radio Observations
DATE:    06/11/06 22:40:40 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst, R.A.M.J. Wijers (University of Amsterdam) and
E. Rol (University of Leicester) report:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 061007 afterglow at 4.8 and 8.6
GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at November 6 11.50 UT
to 16.41 UT, i.e. 30.06 - 30.26 days after the burst (GCN 5707).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical afterglow
(GCN 5706). The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
location of the optical afterglow is -21 +/- 55 microJy at 4.8 GHz,
and 9 +/- 57 microJy at 8.6 GHz.

We would like to thank the staff of the Australia Telescope National
Facility, in particular Philip Edwards, for obtaining these
Target of Opportunity observations."
