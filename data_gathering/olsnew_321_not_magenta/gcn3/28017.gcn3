The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:02:48 UT on 23 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200623B (trigger 614628173.95347 / 200623752).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.9, Dec = -47.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 59m, -47d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
