on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, H. Enos, R. Starr,
and A.S. Gardner on behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

The long-duration GRB 220128A
was detected by Konus-Wind, Swift (BAT), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and Mars-Odyssey (HEND) at about 11897 s UT (03:18:17).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   350.191 (23h 20m 46s) -49.734 (-49d 44' 02")
  Corners:
   349.616 (23h 18m 28s) -46.520 (-46d 31' 11")
   350.856 (23h 23m 25s) -52.699 (-52d 41' 57")
   350.687 (23h 22m 45s) -52.865 (-52d 51' 53")
   349.478 (23h 17m 55s) -46.702 (-46d 42' 08")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2688 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 6.38 deg (the minimum one is 7 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 42 deg.

This box may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
