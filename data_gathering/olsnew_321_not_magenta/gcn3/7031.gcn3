E. Ofek (Caltech) reports:

I note the presence of a 2MASS-cataloged galaxy, 2MASX J03124721+6231391,
just outside the BAT localization region for the short-duration burst
GRB 071101 (McBreen et al. 2007; GCN 7030).
The galaxy is located 3.3 arcmin. from the nominal BAT localization.
By analyzing all the Swift BAT and XRT observed GRB positions,
I find that the probability that the BAT localization is off by
more than 3.3 arcmin is about 3%.
The galaxy J2000.0 position is: 03:12:47.2 +62:31:39, and it
has a total K-band magnitude of 11.4.
