A. Biland (ETH Zurich) reports on behalf of the FACT collaboration:


On July 31, 2016, 1:55:04 UTC, the IceCube collaboration reported the detection of a high-energy neutrino (run number 128290, event number 6888376). The alert was followed up by HAWC (GCN #19743), Swift (GCN #19747) and MASTER (GCN #19748).

FACT observed the updated position on 2016-07-31 from 21:42 UTC to 22:25 UTC with a total on-time of 40 minutes. Apart from a bit of calima, the weather conditions were good. The source was observed at a zenith distance from 50 degree to 58 degree. 

The automatic Quick Look Analysis (http://www.fact-project.org/monitoring) does not show any signal from the position http://fact-project.org/monitoring/index.php?y=2016&m=07&d=31&source=21&timebin=3&plot=night

The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is an imaging air Cherenkov telescope monitoring at TeV energies. It is located in the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary Island La Palma.
