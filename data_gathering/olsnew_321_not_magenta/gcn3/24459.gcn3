report on behalf of the HETH group and GRANDMA collaboration:

We observed the location of the Swift UVOT transient (Breeveld et al., 
GCN #24296) discovered in the error region of the aLIGO/Virgo Binary 
Neutron Star merger event S190425z (Ligo Scientific Collaboration and
VIRGO Collaboration, GCN #24168, #24228), with 
the 2.2m CAHA telescope and CAFOS. We obtained 3 x 240 s each in U/B and 
6 x 120 s in V/Rc/Ic. The observations were performed on 2019-04-28 from 
02:11:50 to 03:52:47 UT.

At the position (Palmese et al., GCN #24312) of the likely counterpart 
(thought to be an M2 dwarf that had a powerful flare which UVOT 
detected, Lipunov et al., GCN #24326; Bloom et al., GCN #24337), we 
detect a source in Rc and Ic and derive the following upper limits and 
magnitudes:

U > 22.9 mag;
B > 23.5 mag;
V > 23.5 mag;
Rc = 22.51 +/- 0.15 mag (depth Rc > 23.8 mag);
Ic = 21.53 +/- 0.15 mag (depth Ic > 22.9 mag).

Magnitudes are given in the AB system and were obtained vs. a comparison 
star from PanSTARRS and the transformations of Lupton (2005).

Our detections are in reasonable agreement with other reports (Palmese 
et al., GCN #24312; Bloom et al., GCN #24337; Hu et al., GCN #24324) and 
indicate the source was quiescent during our observations.
