Bin-Bin Zhang(UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 16:08:39.181 UT on October 18 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor 
triggered and located GRB 131018B (trigger 403805322/131018673), which is also 
detected by Fermi/LAT (Vianello et al. GCN 15357). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the LAT position (Vianello et al., GCN 15357). The angle from 
the Fermi LAT boresight is 23 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one FRED-shape pulse with a duration (T90) of 
about 38 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+30 s 
is well best fit with a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff 
parameterized as Epeak = 77 +/- 7 keV and an Index = -0.25 +/- 0.30. The event 
fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.14 +/- 0.16)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 
1.0-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+1 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 2.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will 
be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
