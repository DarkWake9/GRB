on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

Konus-Wind (KW) was observing the whole sky at the time of the
HAWC burst alert (2019-08-06 13:20:48.0 UTC, hereafter T0;
The HAWC Collaboration GCN Circ. 25284).

No triggered KW event happened in the +/- 1 day interval centered at T0.
Using waiting-mode data (20-1500 keV) within the interval T0 +/- 2000 s,
we have found a single 13 s-long event at ~30 minutes before T0
with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~4.5 sigma in the KW detector
observing the HAWC event position.

For the remaining part of the T0 +/- 2000 s interval we estimate
an upper limit (90% conf.) on the 10 keV â€“ 1.5 MeV fluence
to 9.0x10^-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 2.944 s
and having a typical KW short GRB spectrum
(an exponentially cut off power law with alpha =-0.5 and Ep=500 keV).
For a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band function with alpha=-1,
beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the corresponding limiting peak flux
is 2.2x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (10 keV - 1.5 MeV, 2.944 s scale).

All the quoted values are preliminary.
