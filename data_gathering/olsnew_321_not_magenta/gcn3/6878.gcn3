J. A. Kennea (PSU), V. Mangano (INAF/IASF) and C. Markwardt (GSFC/UMD) 
report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

At 22:29:34 UT on Oct 10th, 2007, Swift/XRT began observing the field of 
the BAT detected burst GRB071010B (Markwardt et al., GCN #6871). XRT took 
807s of PC mode data, and detects an uncatalogued point source at the 
following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 10h 02m 09.2s,
Dec(J2000) = +45d 43m 52.2s,

with an estimated error of 5 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). This 
position lies 20 arcseconds from the refined BAT position (GCN #6877), and 
1.9 arcseconds from the tentative optical counterpart reported by Oksanen 
et al. (GCN #6873).

Due to the short observation, we are unable to determine if this X-ray 
source is fading.
