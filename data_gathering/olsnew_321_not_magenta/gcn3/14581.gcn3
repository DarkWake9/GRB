V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), K.Antoniuk (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on 
behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 130502A (Troja et al., GCN 14527) 
with AZT-11 telescope of CrAO observatory on May 02 starting on (UT) 
18:20:46, i.e. ~30 min after burst trigger. We took several images in 
R-filter of 180 s exposure.  Within enchanced XRT position (Beardmore et 
al., GCN  14536) we do  not detect any source. Preliminary photometry of 
a combined image is following
