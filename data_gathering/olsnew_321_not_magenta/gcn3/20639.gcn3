R. Marcinkowski (PSI), H. Xiao (PSI) and W. Hajdas (PSI) report on behalf
of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-02-06 11:40:10 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data,
POLAR detected GRB 170206C, which was also marginally observed by
Integral/SPIACS (trigger 2017-02-06T11:40:10).

The POLAR light curve consists of 2 peaks with duration (T90) of
16.0 +/- 0.5 s measured from T0. The 0.5 s peak flux at T0 + 3.2 s is
equal to 1400 +/- 100 counts/sec. POLAR recorded about 9700 events
from the burst.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 20 - 500 keV,
presented light curve is not deadtime corrected.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Calibration of the
instrument is ongoing. POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter
which was launched on-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2)
on Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
