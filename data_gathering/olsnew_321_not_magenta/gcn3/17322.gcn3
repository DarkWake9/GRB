We observed the position of GRB 150110B (Evans et al., GCN 17291)
at 15 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on
2015 Jan 14.466 to 14.632 UT and 2015 Jan 16.415 to Jan 16.581,
corresponding to 3.5 and 5.5 days post-burst. On these two dates we
have detected a radio source coincident with the Swift-XRT position
(Beardmore et al., GCN 17294) with a preliminary flux of 0.25 +/- 0.05 mJy
and 0.47 +/- 0.05 mJy, respectively. There are no catalogued radio sources
at this position.

An earlier observation was conducted on 2015 Jan 11.434 to 11.580 UT,
corresponding to 0.5 days post-burst, yielding a 3 sigma flux upper limit
of 0.13 mJy.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
