W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:


The giant flare observed by INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS - GCN 2920) was also detected
by Mars Odyssey (GRS).  Data from other IPN spacecraft have not
been received yet.  A very preliminary analysis indicates that 
the arrival time at Odyssey is indeed consistent with an arrival
direction from SGR1806-20.  Further analysis is underway and will
be reported later.
