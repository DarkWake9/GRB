WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the GBM GRB 191001A (Fermi GBM team,
GCN 25893) starting at ~21.8 hours after the burst. We observed
the afterglow candidate AT2019rog, which was discovered independently
by ATLAS (Tonry et al., TNSTR 1954) and DDOTI (Pereyra et al., GCN 25911),
obtaining 17 x 60s images in the clear (roughly R) filters. We do not
detect the afterglow candidate in our co-add images with limiting mag
of ~21.5. Our non-detection result is consistent with observations from
RATIR (Pereyra et al., GCN 25918).
