Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the VLT position of the GRB 081118 optical afterglow (GCN
8528) at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) between 01:15:05 UT, November 24, 2008 and 20:35:30 UT, November
25, 2008.

We did not detect a radio source at the optical afterglow position of
the GRB 081118 (GCN 8528). The data at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz were merged
and the radio flux density at the afterglow position found out to be -89
+/- 5.6 uJy/beam (1-sigma).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
