Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210820A (trigger #1069551)
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 30664).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 20.622, 4.642 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 22m 29.4s
   Dec(J2000) = +04d 38' 30.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows many weak overlapping pulses
that start at ~T0 and end at ~T+260 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is
196.8 +- 51.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.78 to T+258.97 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.26 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+10.92 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
