B. Monard (Bronberg Obs.) reports on behalf
of the AAVSO International High Energy Network:

We observed the localization of the HETE burst GRB050709
(Graziana et al. GCN 3570) with the 30cm telescope of Bronberg
Observatory.  532 seconds of stacked unfiltered observations
with mipoint at 050711.127 (28.4hrs after the burst) reached
a limiting magnitude of CR=20.0.  No new object is present
in the HETE SXC error box to a limiting magnitude of 19.5R,
compared to the DSS-2 red image.  The images also covered
about 1/2 of the WXM error box.

The AAVSO thanks the Curry Foundation for their continued support of the
AAVSO International High Energy Network.
