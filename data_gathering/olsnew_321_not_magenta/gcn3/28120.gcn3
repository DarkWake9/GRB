report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:



"At 01:26:37.76 UT on 16 July 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)

triggered and located GRB 200716A (trigger 616555602 / 200716060) ,

which also triggered AGILE (Ursi A. et al., GCN #28116)

and AstroSat (Gupta et al., GCN #28117).



The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization is reported in GCN #28109.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 76 degrees.



The GBM light curve shows multiple peaks with

a duration (T90) of about 45 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-9.5 s to T0+59.1 s is

best fit by a Comptonized model with Epeak = 456 +/- 17 keV

and alpha = -0.97 +/- 0.01 .



The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is

(5.986 +/- 0.041)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured

starting from T0+31 s in the 10-1000 keV band

is 24.0 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.



The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;

final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
