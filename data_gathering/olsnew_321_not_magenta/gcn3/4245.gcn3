NUMBER:  4245
SUBJECT: GRB 051109B. Radio Observations

Dale A. Frail (NRAO), Alicia M. Soderberg (Caltech), and P. Brian
Cameron (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 051109B (GCN 4222; GCN 4237) with the
Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz around November 11.15 UT. There is no
radio source at the XRT position (GCN 4226; GCN 4232), with a limit of
25 ± 23 uJy.

Within the ±2.0 arcmin BAT error radius GCN 4237) we find one radio
source at RA(J2000)=23 01 52.77, DEC(J2000) = +38 41 47.9, with
(conservative) astrometric errors of order 0.5 arcsec. This is likely
a background radio source, unrelated to the GRB. No further
observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
