The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:14:28 UT on 24 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210324A (trigger 638277273.212466 / 210324468).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 148.5, Dec = 37.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 54m, 37d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 76.0 degrees.
