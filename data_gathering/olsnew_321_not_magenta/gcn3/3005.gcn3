Swift-BAT detected a burst at 03:35:14.79 UT.  The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA,Dec 290.560, -38.720 (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a systematic
uncertainty).

This appears to be a short burst (single spike, duration of ~400
msec), dominated by emission in the 25-100 keV band.  The peak rate is
approximately 3000 ct/s.

However, there are some longer-term variations (~150 sec) in the
lowest energy band (15-25 keV).  These could be due to (a)
magnetospheric variations, (b) variations of the galactic sources in
the field of view, or (c) intrinsic GRB variations.  When more
complete data is available, we should be able to remove this
ambiguity.
