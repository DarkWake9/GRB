We observed the position of GRB 150626B (McCauley et al., GCN 17966,
Goad et al., GCN 17968) at 16 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager
(AMI-LA) at 2015 June 26.85, June 27.58, and July 03.56 UT, corresponding
to 0.01 days, 0.73 days and 6.71 days post-burst respectively. The GRB
flux densities at these three epochs were <0.19 mJy (3 sigma upper limit),
0.17+/-0.05 mJy (marginal detection), and 0.29+/-0.06 mJy (confirmed 
detection)
respectively.

Further AMI monitoring is ongoing. We thank the AMI scheduling team for
carrying out these observations.
