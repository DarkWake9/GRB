D. Perez (U. Leicester-U. Jaen), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), T. N. Ukwatta
(GSFC/GWU), report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:


We have analysed the first three orbits of data obtained for GRB 080623
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 7894), covering 4.3ks of Photon Counting (PC)
mode data. The UVOT-enhanced XRT position was given by Beardmore et al.
in GCN Circ. 7898.

The light-curve can be fitted with a single powerlaw with a decay of
alpha ~1.0 +/- 0.1.


The first three orbits of PC data can be modelled with an absorbed
powerlaw, with Gamma = 2.03 +/- 0.14 and total NH = (0.37 +/-
0.05)x10^22 cm^-2, in excess of the Galactic value of 0.26x10^22 cm^-2.

The observed (unabsorbed) flux over this time interval is 8.05 x10^-12
(1.34x10^-11) erg cm^-2 s^-1.  The counts to observed flux conversion is
5.3x10^-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

If the light-curve continues to decay at alpha ~ 1.0, the count rate at
24 hours is predicted to be 0.0086 count s^-1, corresponding to an
observed flux of 4.5x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
