A.Volnova (SAI MSU), E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:
We observed the field of the Swift GRB 121128A (Oates et al., GCN 14007)
with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy). We took several
images in R-filter of 60 s exposure on Nov. 28, between (UT) 10:27:30 -
13:43:09 under favorable weather conditions. We detected optical afterglow
(Oates et al., GCN 14007; Japelj et al., GCN 14008) in stacked images. A
photometry of some stacked image in the beginning of our observations and
final stacked image is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars:
t_start, T0+ (mid), filter, exp., OT, err
(UT)     d                           s

10:46:51 0.24047 R     10x60 19.95 +/- 0.06
13:00:21 0.34123 R     49x40 20.58 +/- 0.07

The photometry is still preliminary.
