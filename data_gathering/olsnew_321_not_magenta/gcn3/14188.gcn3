Andy Beardmore (Univ. Leicester), A. Breeveld (MSSL-UCL) and M. De
Pasquale (MSSL-UCL) on behalf of the Swift team, report:

The Swift-XRT began observing the field of GRB130206A (De Pasquale et al.,
GCN Circ. 14181) in photon counting  mode at 2013-02-06 20:28 UT, 3090 s
after the trigger. In 10.3 ks of data we find a faint source at RA, Dec =
140.37670, -58.19362 which is equivalent to

RA  (J2000) = 09h 21m 30.41s
Dec (J2000) = -58d 11' 37.0"

with an uncertainty of 5.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence). The
source is located 20 arcseconds from the BAT refined position
(Stamatikos et al, GCN Circ, 14186), within the BAT error circle.

The source is detected at a count rate of 0.0017 Â± 0.0006 count/s. We
cannot tell if it is fading at this time.

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB130206A
3081 s after the BAT trigger.
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position is detected in the
initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first finding

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the strong Galactic
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.48 in the direction of the
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
