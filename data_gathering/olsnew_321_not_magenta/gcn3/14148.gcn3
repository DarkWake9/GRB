V. Kouprianov (GAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI),  report on behalf of larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 130122A (Lien  et al., GCN 14140) with 
SANTEL-400AN (0.4-m f/3)  telescope of ISON-Kislovodsk observatory. 
Observations started on  Jan. 22 (UT) 23:44  and we obtained  several 
unfiltered images  of 60 s and 100 s exposures. Initial part of our 
observations were carried under unfavorable weather conditions. Starting on 
Jan.23 (UT) 00:14:14 we clearly detect optical afterglow of GRB 130122A 
(Lien  et al., GCN 14140; Sonbas et al., GCN 14141; Gorbovskoy  et al., GCN 
14142) in single images of 60 s exposure. A  preliminary photometry of 
stacked  images is based  on USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby  stars:
