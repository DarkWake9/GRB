and INFN Trieste) report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190421ar at T0 = 2019-04-21
21:38:56 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL)
data found no event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 1000 sec
from the LIGO-Virgo T0.

Two-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S190421ar 90% c.l.
localization region, from a minimum of 1.30E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of
3.02E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with
photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
