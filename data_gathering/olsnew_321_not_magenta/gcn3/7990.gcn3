"We have been monitoring the optical afterglow of GRB080721 (Marshall
et al. GCN Circ 7988) using the Lulin 1 m telescope after the twilight
(~ 96 min after the burst). Based on Lulin R-band data, the optical
afterglow is located at RA=14:57:55.835, Dec=-11:43:24.76 with less
than 1" position error.  The brightness of the optical afterglow at 98
min after the burst is R~18.1.

Further optical observation is in progress."
