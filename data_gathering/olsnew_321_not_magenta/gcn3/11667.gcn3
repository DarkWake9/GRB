Boer M. (OHP-OAMP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 110207A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 444912) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 6.62h after the GRB trigger
(beginning of the night). The elevation of the field
decreased from 25 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures.
No OT was detected :
t0+6.62h to t0+7.79h : R > 19.8

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=121.8238 lat=-73.6747
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.1 magnitude
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
