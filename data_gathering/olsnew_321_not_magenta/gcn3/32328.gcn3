Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220701A (trigger #1114034)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 32306).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 242.474, 55.436 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 09m 53.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +55d 26' 08.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 56%.

The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a fairly weak peak extending from
Roughly T-2 to T+8 seconds. T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.77 +- 1.13 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.40 to T+4.83 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.37 +- 0.34.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.65 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
