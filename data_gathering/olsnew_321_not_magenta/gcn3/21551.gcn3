On 2017 Aug 18.01 UT we obtained g-band images of the transient source
SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017; GCN
21529) possibly associated with LIGO/Virgo G298048, with LDSS-3 on the 6.5m
Magellan-Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.  We measure a
provisional magnitude of g = 17.2 +/- 0.1, consistent with the blue color
reported spectroscopically by Drout et al. 2017 (GCN 21547) and at redder
wavelengths by Nicholl et al. 2017 (GCN 21541).  We also note a tentative
detection of a slight decrease in brightness over three exposures spanning
12 minutes.  Further analysis is ongoing.
