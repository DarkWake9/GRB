report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 10:37:36.71 UT on 8 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201008A (trigger 623846261 / 201008443),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (DeLaunay et al. 2020, GCN 28583).
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 60 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a multi-peaked emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.26 s to T0+2.11 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.80 +/- 0.13 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 166 +/- 21 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.17 +/- 0.09)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.28 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 7.3 +/- 1.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
