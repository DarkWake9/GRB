FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

At the time of the neutrino candidate IceCube-190704A
(GCN 24981), Fermi was passing through the South Atlantic
Anomaly from 6 minutes prior to 19 minutes after the trigger
time; therefore the GBM detectors were disabled.
