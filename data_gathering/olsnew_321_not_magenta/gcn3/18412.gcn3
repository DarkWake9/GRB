C. Gronwall (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:47:47 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
the combination of the rate increase due to the SAA and a marginal
significance image fluctuation (trigger=658045).  Swift slewed 
immediately to the image peak.  The BAT light curve showed the 
usual rising background rate as expected on entry to the SAA. 

Because of the proximity to the SAA, the XRT centroided on a cosmic ray.
