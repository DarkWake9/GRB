We imaged the field of GRB 130408A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 553132) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 13.99h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
87.5 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The co addition of the six images filtered C, g, r
gives one image with an equivalent exposure time
of 540s. We did not detected the afteglow
mentioned in Melandri et al. (GCNC 14362):

t0+13.99h to t0+14.56h : Rlim = 20.5

The limiting magnitude of the zadko image is R~20.5.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1
stars and are not corrected for galactic
dust extinction.

[GNC OPS NOTE(17apr13):  Per athor's request, the GRB name
was changed from "1130408A" to "130408A".]
