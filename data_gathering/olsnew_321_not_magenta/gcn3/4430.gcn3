GRB060105 : Kiso optical observation

H. Izumiura (NAOJ), H. Mito(Tokyo U.), Y. Urata (RIKEN), K.Y. Huang,
W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Qiu (BAO) on behalf of EAFON report:

" We started R band imaging observation for GRB 060105 (Ziaeepour et
al. # 4429) using Kiso observatory's 1.05-m Schmidt telescope at 09:39
UT (2.82 hour after the burst).  There are no new sources down to the
R=20.2 (S/N=3).  Since we could not find the UVOT candidate with the
limiting magnitude, the source has potential to be an afterglow of GRB
060105.

Further analysis is in progress."
