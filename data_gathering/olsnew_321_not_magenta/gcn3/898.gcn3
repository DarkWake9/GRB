P.A. Price, T.S. Axelrod and B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) report:

"We have observed the error box of the short/hard GRB001204 (Hurley et al.,
GCN #895, #897) with the robotic 50-inch telescope at Mount Stomlo Observatory
starting at 2000 Dec 7.42 (approximately 3 days after the burst).  Our 3x300s
exposures in R_MACHO cover the entire error box.  We find no optical transient
candidate on visual comparison of the combined image with the DSS-2 red scan,
to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 20.1 (based on USNO catalogue)."
