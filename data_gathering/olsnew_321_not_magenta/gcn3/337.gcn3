D. A. Frail (NRAO), S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech), C. H. Young
(MSU, NRAO) and G. B. Taylor (NRAO) report:

"We have analyzed additional VLA observations of the fast X-ray
transient detected by BeppoSAX (GCN 333) taken at 1.4, 4.8 and 8.5 GHz
beginning on May 20.93 UT. The positional accuracy of the radio source
reported in GCN 334 has improved to (equinox 2000) R.A.=08 36 1.1
(+/-0.1s), decl.=+51 17 6.5 (+/-1") and it is now coincident with the
center of the optical galaxy reported by Bloom et al. (GCN 335). There
was no evidence of any variability between the two VLA observations.
It now appears that this is an inverted spectrum radio source, present
also at a weak level (3-sigma) in the VLA FIRST survey at 1.4 GHz.

This message is citeable."
