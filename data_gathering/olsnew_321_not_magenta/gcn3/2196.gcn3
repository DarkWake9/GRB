Michael Weidinger, Johan P. U. Fynbo (U. of Aarhus), Jens Hjorth 
(U. of Copenhagen), Javier Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC/STScI), Paul Vreeswijk 
(ESO Chile), Sylvio Klose (TLS Tautenburg) report on behalf of the 
GRACE collaboration:

"We have observed the field of GRB 030429 (=HETE trigger 2695) around
May 2.2 UT with the ESO VLT. Using FORS1 on UT1 we have obtained a 
spectrum of the optical afterglow (GCN 2184) covering 3800 - 8000 
Angstrom. In the spectrum we identify a strong damped Ly-alpha line 
around 4442 Angstrom. This implies a lower limit of z=2.65 to the 
redshift of GRB 030429. The absence of Ly-alpha forest absorption on 
the red side of the line and the seemingly very large column density 
of the line renders a higher redshift very unlikely and we therefore 
conclude that z=2.65 is the redshift of GRB 030429. 

We acknowledge excellent support from Cedric Ledoux, Rachel Johnson, 
Poshak Gandhi and Elena Mason at the Paranal Observatory."
