report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:36:52.81 UT on 16 January 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180116A (trigger 537755817 / 180116026)
which was also detected by the MAXI/GSC (H. Kawai et al. 2018, GCN 22347).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the MAXI/GSC position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 39
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 60 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.07 s to T0+58.37 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.72 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.54 +/- 0.28)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.47 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.98 +/- 0.24 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
