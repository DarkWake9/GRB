The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 07:28:04.65 UT on 8 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220408B (trigger 671095689.64512 / 220408311).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA =  94.8, Dec = -50.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 19m, -50d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 30.3 degrees.
