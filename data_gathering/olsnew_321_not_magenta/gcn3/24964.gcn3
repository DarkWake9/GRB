In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190701ah at T0 = 2019-07-01 20:33:06.578
(UT), an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure at T0
showed that the S190701ah 90% c.l. localization region (LR) was entirely occulted by
the Earth.

However, full coverage of the S190701ah field was obtained around 1100 s after T0,
at an off-axis angle of about 20 deg. We thus performed an analysis of the GRID data
in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV over a time interval of 100 s starting from
T0+1100s.

The following preliminary GRID 3-sigma upper limit (UL) values are obtained over
the 100% of the exposed LR:

(T0+1100s; T0+1200s): from 3.3e-08 to 3.7e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
