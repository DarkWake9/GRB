Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080723 (trigger #317662)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 8000).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 274.461, -6.910 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  18h 17m 50.6s
    Dec(J2000) = -06d 54' 34.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The burst was in the fully coded part of the BAT field of view.

The mask-weighted light curve showed a double-peaked structure, with the
first peak extending from T-1 sec to T+4 sec, and the second smaller 
peak from T+6 sec to T+20 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 17.3 +- 3.0 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+18.7 sec is best fit by a 
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.77 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
3.3 +- 0.4 x 10-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T-0.13 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
