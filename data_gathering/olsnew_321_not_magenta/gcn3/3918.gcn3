on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

Using only a small amount of the full data set from recent telemetry
downlinks, we report further analysis of Swift-BAT Trigger #153514
(Cummings, et al., GCN 3910).  Due to a large backlog in data downlinking,
we have only the data from T-40 to T+120 sec.  We do not expect the full
data set for at least another 2 days, so we are issuing this partial report.
The ground-analysis position is RA,Dec 13.722,14.081 {0h54m53s, 14d04'52"}
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin (radius, 90%, stat+sys).
This is 3.9 arcmin from the onboard position and 0.54 arcmin from the
IR afterglow position reported by Haislip et al.  in GCN Circ. 3913.

This is a long burst with T90 greater than 120 sec.  The burst started
at T+0 sec with continued emission past T+120 sec (where the downlinked
data stops).
