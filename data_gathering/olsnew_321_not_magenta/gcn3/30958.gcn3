The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:05:43 UT on 23 Oct 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211023A (trigger 656687148.17411 / 211023546).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 78.8, Dec = 82.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 15m, 82d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 56.0 degrees.
