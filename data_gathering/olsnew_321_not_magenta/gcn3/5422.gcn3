D. Malesani (SISSA) & S. Piranomonte (INAF/Roma) report on behalf of the 
MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the candidate optical counterpart (Fynbo et al., GCN 5420) 
of GRB 060807 (De Pasquale et al., GCN 5409; Barthelmy et al., GCN 
5421). Observations were carried out in the K and R filters, with 
NTT+SofI and VLT+FORS1, respectively. The mean times were 8.46 and 8.72 
hr after the burst.

The candidate is well detected in both filters, and shows a very red 
color. Preliminary calibrations against 2MASS and USNO-B1 (R1 
magnitudes) shows R-K ~ 5 (assuming negligible time variations between 
the two epochs). We warn that there is some scatter (by ~0.2 mag) in the 
calibration for both the R- and K bands, so this value should be still 
considered as preliminary.

We acknowledge prompt support from the VLT and NTT observing staffs, in 
particular Claudio Melo and Valentin Ivanov.
