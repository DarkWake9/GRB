"We have performed almost daily R-band monitoring of the XRF 050509c
field (GCN Circ. 3402, HETE-2 trigger #3751) from May 15 to June 8.
No significant rebrightening brighter than R ~ 22.5 has been detected at
the afterglow position (GCN Circ. 3425) during the mentioned period.

If XRF 050509c was related to a supernova similar to SN 1998bw, our
observations would impose a lower redshift limit of z > 0.4.

A combination of all late images 
(www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb050509.95/)
reveals a faint (R ~ 24) object coincident with the afterglow position,
which we tentatively identify as the host galaxy of XRF 050509c."
