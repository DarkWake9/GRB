GRB041006 (= H3570): Chandra Observations In Progress

G. Ricker, N. Butler, P. Ford, H. Marshall,  R. Vanderspek (MIT); G. 
Garmire (PSU); and  D. Lamb (U. Chicago), on behalf of a Chandra GRB 
ToO Team,

write:

Chandra grating spectrometer observations of the afterglow 
counterpart (Da Costa, Noel, and Price; GCN2765) for GRB041006 -- a 
bright, X-ray rich gamma-ray burst discovered by HETE (= H3570: 
Galassi et al, GCN 2770) -- are in progress.

The Chandra LETG/ACIS observation commenced at approximately 5:30 UT 
on 7 October 2004, and will continue for approximately 26 hours. The 
scheduling of contemporaneous photometry and spectroscopy at other 
wavelengths is strongly encouraged.

We are grateful to Harvey Tananbaum and the Chandra X-ray Center 
observatory staff for scheduling this observation to commence only 17 
hours after the GRB event.
