U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160927A detected by SWIFT(trigger 713782)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy. Member of: 
AAVSO - American Association of Variable Star Observers.
ISSP - Italian Supernovae Search Project.
UAI/SSV - Unione Astrofili Italiani/sezione stelle variabili.

The observations started 11.72 min after the GRB trigger,  
with our Newton telescope D=250 mm F/D=4.8.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added 52 exposures of 60 sec each.
