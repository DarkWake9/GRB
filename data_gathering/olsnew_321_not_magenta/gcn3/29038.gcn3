We analyzed the latest Chandra observations of GW170817
carried out between Dec 09 and Dec 13, 2020 for a total
exposure of  about 65 ks (out of 100 ks approved for
program 21510449; PI: Margutti)
At the transient position we detect a total of 9 counts
within a circular region of 1 arcsec radius, corresponding
to a count rate (1.5 +/- 0.5)E-04 cts/s (0.5-8.0 keV).
This is slightly higher than the value measured at 940 days
(0.8 +/- 0.3)E-04 cts/s  (Troja et al., 2020, MNRAS, 498, 5643)
and consistent within the errors. By using a power-law spectrum
with photon index Gamma=1.57, we derive an X-ray flux of
(2.6 +/- 0.9)E-15 erg/cm2/s.

Further analysis is on-going.
