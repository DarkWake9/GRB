"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and Wide Field Camera
(WFC unit 1) observed a gamma-ray burst on February 14.042 UT. 
A preliminary analysis reveals a duration of about 9 s in the GRBM, 
with a peak photon countrate of 4.2E3 cts/s in the 40-700 keV energy 
band. In the WFC, the duration is about 115 s and the peak flux is 
2.9 Crab (2-26 keV). The position of the X-ray counterpart is 
R.A.= 18h 4m 18s Decl.= -66 26'.3" (equinox 2000.0) with a 99% 
error radius of 6.5'. An NFI follow-up is being carried on."
