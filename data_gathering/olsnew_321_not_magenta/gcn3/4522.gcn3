We have analyzed the first orbit of XRT data from GRB 060116
(trigger 177533; Campana et al., GCN 4519). A 1364 s Photon Counting
mode image provides a refined XRT position:

RA(J2000) = 05h 38m 46.20s,
Dec(J2000) = -05d 26m 12.8s

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (90% containment). This position
includes the latest XRT boresight correction. This position is 0.8
arcmin from the BAT position.
