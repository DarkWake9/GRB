G. Di Cocco, F. Fuschino, M. Galli, C. Labanti, and M. Marisaldi, on
behalf of the AGILE MCAL team, report:

The very long, bright GRB 130320B was observed by Konus-Wind, Mars 
Odyssey (HEND), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Fermi (GBM trigger 385478797), Swift 
(BAT), AGILE (MCAL), and MESSENGER (GRNS) at about 48247 s UT 
(13:24:07). The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

The burst shows three emission episodes with a total duration of ~380 s.
The entire burst was observed  by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, and Mars 
Odyssey (HEND). AGILE (MCAL) observed only the first (main) episode. 
Fermi (GBM) triggered on the second episode while exiting the SAA and 
also observed the third episode. MESSENGER (GRNS) triggered twice: on 
the first and on the third episode. These two episodes were also 
observed by Swift (BAT).

We have triangulated it to a 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   195.539 (13h 02m 09s) -71.259 (-71d 15' 34")
  Corners:
   197.046 (13h 08m 11s) -71.078 (-71d 04' 39")
   196.172 (13h 04m 41s) -71.308 (-71d 18' 30")
   194.010 (12h 56m 02s) -71.427 (-71d 25' 38")
   194.909 (12h 59m 38s) -71.208 (-71d 12' 29")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 431 sq. arcmin, and its maximum dimension is
62 arcmin (the minimum one is 22 arcmin).

The IPN localizations of all three pulses are consistent with a common 
source.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN
Circular.
