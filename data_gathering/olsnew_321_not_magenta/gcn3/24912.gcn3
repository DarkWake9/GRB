The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:09:58 UT on 30 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190630A (trigger 583567803.319036 / 190630257).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 307.0, Dec = -1.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 27m, -1d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
