A. Volnova (IKI),  E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Kusakin 
(Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute),  I. Reva (Fesenkov Astrophysical 
Institute)    report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 170705A (Starling et al. GCN 
21289) which is also detected by GBM/Fermi and Konus-Wind  (Bissaldi  et 
al., GCN 21297; Svinkin et al., GCN 21299)  with Zeiss-1000 1-m 
telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory on July 6-8.  We took 
several images in R-filter.  The optical afterglow  of GRB 170705A 
(Starling et al. GCN 21289, Lipunov et al. GCN 21291, Butler et al. GCN 
21293, Emery et al. GCN 21294; Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 21298)  is 
visible in a combined image on July 6, and upper limit only for July 
7-8. Preliminary  photometry of the afterglow is following.
