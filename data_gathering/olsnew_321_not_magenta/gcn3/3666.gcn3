L.A. Antonelli (INAF/OAR), S. Covino (INAF/OAB), D. Malesani (SISSA), 
P. Romano, A. Moretti (INAF/OAB) on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration 
report:

We looked at the DSS image of the field of the short GRB 050724 (Covino 
et al., GCN 3665). We note the presence of a faint object located at 
RA: 16h 24m 44.9s DEC -27d 32' 33.3" (J2000) and centered on XRT 
position (Covino et al., GCN 3665) which is under the threshold of both 
USNO and 2MASS catalogues. We estimated a R mag for this object of 19.1 
calibrating with the nearby USNO star (U600_20428424 RA: 16:24:47.92, 
DEC: -27:32:21.05 R=16.5 mag).
