(Urumqi No.1 Senior High School), J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 201229A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 29192) 
using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We 
obtained 5 x 200 s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 19:52:23 UT 
on 2020-12-29, i.e., 8.88 hr after the burst.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the Swift/UVOT 
position (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 29192), down to a upper limiting of 
r~20.4, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
