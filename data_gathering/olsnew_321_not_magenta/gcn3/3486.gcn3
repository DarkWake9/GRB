GRB 050525 : Lulin optical afterglow observations

P.S. Chiang (NCKU), K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

" We have imaged the GRB 050525 optical afterglow position reported by
Rykoff et al.(GCN 3468) and Torii et al. (GCN 3470) using 1.0-m
telescope at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. The afterglow was detected at
LOT images. The R band magnitude of afterglow is about 21.3 +/-0.1
around 17.74 hours after burst ( exposure time 300sec x 4) which
compared with USNOB-1.0 stars.

Further analysis are in progress. This message may be
cited."
