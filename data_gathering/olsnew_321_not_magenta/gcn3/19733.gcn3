The short GRB 160726A (Swift/BAT detection: Starling et al., GCN 19731;
Fermi GBM observation: Hamburg et al., GCN 19732)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=5645.315 s UT (01:34:05.315).

The light curve shows a short pulse with a total duration is ~0.2 s.
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(1.5 ± 0.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+0.016, of (1.1 ± 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.128 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range by a cutoff power-law
(CPL) function with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.65(-0.47,+0.71),
and the peak energy Ep = 424(-163,+389) keV,
chi2 = 19.5/20 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep with only an upper limit on beta of -1.8,
chi2 = 19.5/19 dof.

All the presented results are preliminary.
