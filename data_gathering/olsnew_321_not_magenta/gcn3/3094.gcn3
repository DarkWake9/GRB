on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 20:59:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB 050315.  The spacecraft automatically slewed
to the burst location, and UVOT began automated observations.  XRT was
not in a mode suitable for immediate position determination.

Using the time interval of the trigger of the burst, the 
ground-calculated
location is RA,Dec 306.476,-42.591 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 
arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 40 degrees off the BAT boresight (60% coding).

The burst lightcurve has 2 overlapping FRED-like peaks.  The duration
is ~40 sec.  There is no further emmission out to T+180 sec, where the 
end
of the real-time TDRSS data ends.  The peak count rate is ~2500 
counts/sec.
