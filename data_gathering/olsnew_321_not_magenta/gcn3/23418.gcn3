Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) and
P.A. Evans report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 181110A (Evans et al. GCN
Circ. 23413), from 67 s to 24.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 260 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 23417).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.2 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=2.10 (+/-0.14).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.88 (+/-0.04). The
best-fitting absorption column is  8.6 (+1.0, -0.9) x 10^20 cm^-2,
consistent with the Galactic value of 7.7 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.74 (+0.07,
-0.06) and a best-fitting absorption column consistent with the
Galactic value. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.8 x 10^-11 (4.3 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     7.7 (+1.5, -0.0) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 7.7 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.74 (+0.07, -0.06)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.10, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 2.2 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 8.3 x
10^-14 (9.3 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
