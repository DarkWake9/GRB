TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16408
SUBJECT: GRB 140614C found in ground analysis of BAT data
DATE:    14/06/15 14:51:46 GMT
FROM:    Jay R. Cummings at NASA/GSFC/Swift  <james.r.cummings@nasa.gov>

J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The IPN reported a burst at 20:06:56. It occurred near the end of a Swift
pointing on top of an approach to the SAA.  No source was found onboard.
In ground analysis a significant source was found at RA, Dec  147.423, 71.945,
which is:

RA (J2000)    09h 49m 41.5s
Dec (J2000)   71d 56' 41"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 3 arcmin.

The burst was a single peak about 20 seconds long.

The spectrum during the peak 10 seconds of the burst is best fit by a
simple power law function with a photon index of 1.0 ± 0.3.  The fluence
from 15-150 keV in the 10 seconds was (1.6 ± 0.5) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.
Errors quoted are 68% confidence.

A Swift TOO has been requested.
