"GRB 000210 was observed with the Narrow Field Instruments (NFI) on board 
 BeppoSAX from Feb. 10.66 UT to 11.98 UT (starting 7.2 hrs after the 
 burst trigger time). In the combined image of both Medium-Energy 
 Concentrator Spectrometers, taken over the whole observation, a point 
 source, showing an unambiguous fading behaviour, is detected with a 
 position of R.A. = 01h59m15.9s, Decl. = -40d39'29" (Eq. 2000.0) and an 
 error circle of 50''. This is consistent with the position given by 
 Chandra in an observation performed during the central part of BeppoSAX 
 observation (GCN #548) and with the position of the optical object
 reported in GCN #545. In the first 30,000 s of the observation the
 object flux (2-10 keV) is about 4.5E-13 erg/cmE2/s. In the last 40,000 s
 of the observation the source has faded of about a factor three but a 
 fainter soft source, located at about 2 arcmin NE from the X-ray 
 afterglow, contributes a flux not negligible. Therefore an evaluation 
 of the flux and the decay law needs a more refined analysis."
