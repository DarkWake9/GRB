It has been suggested by Ofek et al. (GCN 2434) that the
short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB030929 (Hurley et al., GCN 2409) may
be associated with SN2003jd (Smith et al. IAUC 8021, Filippenko et al.
IAUC 8234, Matheson et al., GCN 2431) and that further analysis of the
IPN data might confirm or disprove this hypothesis.  Accordingly, we
have done a more thorough analysis of the data of all the IPN
spacecraft for this event.  We find that the position of the SN is not
consistent with the IPN localization.  Our analysis may be summarized
as follows.

1. Only two spacecraft, Konus and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), detected this
burst.  The orientation of the INTEGRAL spacecraft was such that
SPI-ACS presented its maximum area to the direction of SN2003jd, yet
the response of this detector was quite weak, suggesting that burst
did not arrive from this direction.

2. The IPN annulus (Konus-INTEGRAL) has been recalculated using data
with higher time resolution.  It is centered at RA, Decl(2000)=
275.939, -7.164 degrees, with radius 72.209 +/- 2.316 degrees (3
sigma).  SN2003jd indeed lies within both the preliminary annulus (GCN
2409) and this refined one.  However, the Konus data indicate that the
burst arrived from an ecliptic latitude between +15 and +90 degrees, that
is, from those portions of the annulus north of RA, Decl=202, +7
degrees, and 344, +9 degrees. SN2003jd therefore lies >15 degrees
outside the allowed portions of the annulus.

3. Although the Ulysses data were clean and complete, and although the
detectors are omnidirectional, Ulysses did not detect this burst.  However,
this could be explained by the fact that it was relatively weak and had
a hard spectrum.

4. Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS) similarly had clean and complete data,
but did not detect the event.  A burst arriving from the direction of
SN2003jd would have been visible to HEND and GRS (That is, not
Mars-blocked).  Given the sensitivities, it is likely, although by no
means certain, that at least one of these instruments would have
detected this burst if it had arrived from the direction of SN2003jd.

5. RHESSI data were also clean and complete, and the position of
SN2003jd was not Earth-blocked.  However, it did not detect this
burst.

6. No data were available from the HETE spacecraft at the time of this
burst.

Thus, solely on the basis of the IPN localization data, we consider it
to be unlikely that there is any association between GRB030929 and
SN2003jd.
