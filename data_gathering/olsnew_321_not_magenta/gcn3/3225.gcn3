E. O. Ofek, Y. Lipkin (Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 050410 (La Parola et al. 2005,
GCN 3218) using the Wise observatory 1m telescope + Tek CCD camera,
starting at 2005, Apr 10th, 17:05 UT.
Seven 300 sec R-band images were combined (mid exposure time 5.25 hours
after the burst).

No new source was detected within a radius which is twice the Swift XRT
error circle radius, down to a limiting magnitude of R=20.0
