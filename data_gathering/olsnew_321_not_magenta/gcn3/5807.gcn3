Centre), Christina Henriksen (DARK, NOT) and Dimitri Sharapov (NOT)
report:

We observed the OT of GRB061110B (GCN 5804) starting Nov. 10, UT 23:20 (1h
after the burst), with ALFOSC at the NOT on La Palma in R and i.

From two sets of 3x300s stacked images, we determined magnitudes of R=22.0
and i=21.5 using preliminary photometric zeropoints from the NOT webpages.
Compared to the R-band magnitude reported in GCN 5804, the OT has faded
with a temporal decay index of alpha~2.3.
