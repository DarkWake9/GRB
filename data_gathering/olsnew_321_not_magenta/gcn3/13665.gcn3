U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli A.Quadri report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120816A detected 
by SWIFT(trigger 531223) with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy.

The observations started 26.7 min. after the 
GRB trigger,with our schmidt telescope 
D=320 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were discrete.

We co-added 4 series of 30 x 120s exposures.

We did not appear any optical counterpart 
in the error box of the XRTcandidate
(Page et al.GCNC 13654).
