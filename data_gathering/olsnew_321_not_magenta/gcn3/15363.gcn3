V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, and V. Pelassa, on behalf of 
the Fermi GBM team, report:

The long-duration, intense GRB 131014A (GCN 15332, 15338, 15348) was 
observed by Fermi (GBM: trigger 403420143), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL 
(SPI-ACS), Swift (BAT), Suzaku (WAM), and MESSENGER (GRNS), at about 
18540 s UT (05:09:00). The burst was outside the coded field of view of 
the BAT.

The burst was localized by the Fermi-LAT to a 2290 sq. arcmin. error 
circle (1 sigma, GCN 15333), and the X-ray afterglow was found by the 
Swift-XRT (GCN 15335).

We have triangulated it to a 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   100.286 (06h 41m 09s) -19.130 (-19d 07' 49")
  Corners:
   100.122 (06h 40m 29s) -19.544 (-19d 32' 39")
   100.356 (06h 41m 25s) -19.177 (-19d 10' 38")
   100.448 (06h 41m 48s) -18.714 (-18d 42' 52")
   100.215 (06h 40m 52s) -19.083 (-19d 05' 00")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 251 sq. arcmin, and its maximum dimension is
53 arcmin (the minimum one is 10 arcmin).

The box area is about 10 times smaller than that of the LAT error circle 
(2290 sq. arcmin.).

The reported Swift-XRT source (GCN 15339) is inside the box.

Some improvement in this triangulation is possible.
