and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160821A (Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 19830;
McEnery et al., GCN Circ. 19831; Stanbro et al., GCN Circ. 19835;
INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7537) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 20:36:21.91 on 21 August 2016.  The burst signal was seen by
all CGBM instruments.  Note that the CGBM trigger time is 111 sec after
the trigger time of Swift/BAT.  This is because the CGBM triggered at the
bright main peak of the burst (Markwardt et al. GCN Circ. 19840).

The light curve of the SGM shows a bright peak with several overlapping
pulses.  The emission starts from T sec, peaks at T+24 sec and ends at
T+80 sec.  There is a hint of the emission in the SGM light curve around
the trigger time of Swift/BAT.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data
is 35.1 +- 0.8 sec (40-1000 keV).

CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
