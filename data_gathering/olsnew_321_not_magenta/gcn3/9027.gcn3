S. B. Cenko and D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB090323 (Ohno et al., GCN 9021) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations were taken in the Sloan
r' and i' filters beginning at 2009 Mar 24 04:20 UT (~ 28.30 hr after the
burst).  Inside the XRT error circle (Kennea et al., GCN 9024) we find a
single source consistent with the position repored by Updike et al (GCN
9026).  At this epoch we measure magnitudes of r' = 20.5, i' = 20.0,
suggesting the source has faded since the observations reported therein
(referenced with respected to several nearby SDSS sources).  We therefore
confirm this object is the afterglow of GRB090323.
