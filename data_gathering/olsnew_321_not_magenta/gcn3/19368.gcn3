Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160501A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 684679) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 50 min after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
20 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co added images to increase detectivity:

t1(s) t2(s)  Rmag_lim  Site
3594  5526   18.5      TAROT Calern
5526  7863   18.5      TAROT Calern

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 18.9676 lat=-10.7948
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 1.0 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
