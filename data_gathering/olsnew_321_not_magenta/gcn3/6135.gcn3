As observed by RHESSI, GRB070220 (M. Stamatikos et al., GCN 6114)
had a duration of ~30s starting at about T0=04:44:33 UT.
A fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum of the main period of
emission from T0 - T0+18s between 30 keV and 3.0 MeV gives a
cutoff power law, with

alpha = -0.65 +0.40/-0.35
E0 = 235 +180/-90 keV
Epeak = 315 +115/-70 keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 20 keV-2 MeV fluence is (1.14 +0.16/-0.12) E-5 erg/cm^2.
