This adds to and amends GCN Circ 5987 (Barthelmy) to complete the corrections
to the trigger type identifications for previous Swift-BAT triggers.

The table below contains the Trigger Number, the Trigger Date and Time,
and a Comment about what we are currently classifying the trigger.

TRIGNUM  DATE      TIME       DESCRIPTION

102899   05 Jan 17 20:03:36   We originally issued GCN Circ 2959
                              which called it GRB 050117B,
                              but we now classify this as an SAA-induced
                              noise event.

131395   05 Jun 02 10:41:45   This was classified in GCN Circ 5987 as
                              "S/C drifting in Sun_Reference Safe_Hold mode",
                              but we now believe the s/c attitude was
                              correctly known thus making the identification
                              SGR1806-20 solid; and further, there is temporal
                              coincidence with a HETE detection (K.Hurley,
                              private communication).

158539  05 Oct 06 13:52:40    This was originally classified as EXO 0748-676 
                              in the real-time Notices, but we now classify
                              this as a chance coincidence of noise in the
                              rate and image domains with the location
                              of EXO 0748-676.

213190  06 Jun 02 23:54:34    This was called "GRB060602B (or possibly an XRB)"
                              in GCN Circ 5208, but we now believe this to be
                              an x-ray burster source with a high confidence
                              level.
