D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), M.Lazos, 
N.Mowlavi, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

An X-ray rich GRB lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 09:04:09 UT on September 30, 2006.

The coordinates (J2000)  are:
RA: 304.5363 [degrees], 
DEC: -23.6253

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The peak flux in the 20-200 keV is 0.3 ph/cmq/s (2.2x10e-8 erg/cmq/s) over 
1 s integration time and the fluence in the same energy range is 2.5x10e-7 
erg/cmq

We note that the faint ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J201811.2-233536 is 
contained in the error region. Its RASS count rate of 0.03 counts/s 
corresponds to about 2x10e-13 erg/cmq/s

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
