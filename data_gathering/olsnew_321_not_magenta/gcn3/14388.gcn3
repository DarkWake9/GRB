report:

We observed the field of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale, et al., GCN 14377) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 19.14 to 2013/04 19.19 UTC (8.24 to
9.54 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours exposure
in the r' and i' bands and 0.45 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-UVOT error circle (Kuin et al., GCN 14384),
in comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections
in the AB magnitude system:

 r'    18.87 +/- 0.02
 i'    18.77 +/- 0.02
 Z    18.30 +/- 0.02
 Y    18.07 +/- 0.02
 J    18.06 +/- 0.02
 H    17.53 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.  Relative to the GROND detections about 3 hrs earlier (Nardini
et al., GCN 14386), the afterglow has faded by about 0.4 mag in all
optical/NIR bands.  Continued observations are planned.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
