The long GRB 220624A (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: Fermi GBM team,
GCN Circ. 32256; AGILE detection: Ursi et al., GCN Circ. 32259; AGILE/GRID analysis:
Verrecchia et al., GCN Circ: 32261; Swift/BAT-GUANO detection: Tohuvavohu et al., 
GCN Circ. 32263; IPN triangulation: Kozyrev et al., GCN Circ. 32265; Fermi-GBM 
Detection: Lesage et al., GCN Circ. 32269) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst 
Monitor (CGBM) at 02:58:32.538 UTC on 24 June 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1340074490/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at T+2.5 sec.
The whole episode was not seen by CGBM because the sequence of the HV
turn-off started from T+20 sec.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
