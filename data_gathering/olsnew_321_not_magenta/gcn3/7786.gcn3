Using the data set from T-296 to T+302 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080602 (trigger #312958)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 7781).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 19.177, -9.239 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 16m 42.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 14' 19.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 19%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows 4 or 5 peaks, the first starting at ~T-25 sec,
the second at ~T-15 sec, the 3rd at ~T-5 sec, peaking at ~T+1 sec and 
ending at ~T+15 sec; the 4th starts at ~T+55 sec and ends at ~T+65 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 74 +- 7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.5 to T+69.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.43 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+59.60 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
