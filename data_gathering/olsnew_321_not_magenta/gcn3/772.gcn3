   S. Sinha, P. sreekumar, K. kasturirangan, on behalf of SROSS C-2
(INDIAN GRB EXPERIMENT) team report:

       SROSS C-2 observed this burst at 1800.966 s UT (this time may be
off by a few hundred ms). as observed by SROSS C-2, it had a duration
(T90) of 0.352 secs (352 ms), a 20-1024 keV fluence (not corrected for the
sec (theta) factor since we donot know its location) equal to 6.56.10-5 +-
2.18.10-6 ergs cm-2. The peak flux (256 ms) in 20-100 keV band is 8.81
photons cm-2 sec-1 and the peak flux (256 ms) in 100-1024 keV band is 9.85
photons cm-2 sec-1. The hardness ratio ((100-1024 keV)/(20-100 keV)) for
this burst is equal to 0.47 +- 0.082.
       
       This message is quotable in publications.
