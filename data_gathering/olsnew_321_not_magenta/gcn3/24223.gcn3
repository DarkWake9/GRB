On behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of
Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations

We have analyzed the list of objects reported in Smith et al. (24210),
and examined ZTF alerts for the same objects. We find that 7 of the
events listed below have recent, previous detections with ZTF prior to
the gravitational wave event trigger time and are likely unrelated to the
BNS event S190425z (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration, GCN 24168).
