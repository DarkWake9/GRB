The Time-domain Astronomy Coordination Hub (TACH) project is pleased to announce a
new community tool to access the archive of GCN Notices and Circulars.  The GCN Viewer
ingests new notices and circulars in real time, and associates events detected by multiple

facilities, providing useful categorization and searchability.  This first public release of the

GCN Viewer provides this functionality, and new features will be added with forthcoming

releases.

Please check out the GCN Viewer, and if you have suggestions, feedback, or bug reports,

please contact us via https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=tachgcn.
