TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  26395
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S191212q: Retraction of GW compact binary merger candidate
DATE:    19/12/12 08:52:07 GMT
FROM:    Geoffrey Mo at LIGO  <geoffrey.mo@ligo.org>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S191212q is no longer considered to be a candidate of
interest. There was excess low-frequency noise in the LHO detector at the
time of the event, and the trigger from the LLO detector is not significant
enough on its own.
