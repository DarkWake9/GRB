We imaged the field of GRB 110206A detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 6088, Mereghetti et al. 2011 GCNC 11654)
with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) located at
the European Southern Observatory, La Silla observatory,
Chile.

The observations started 6.3h after the GRB trigger
(beginning of the night). The elevation of the field
increased from 57 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures
t0+6.3h to t0+7.3h : R > 19.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=267.5629 lat=-28.2892
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.1 magnitude
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
