Richard J. Cool (University of Arizona) reports:

Based upon feedback from users of our online releases of SDSS photometry 
and astrometry of GRB fields, we have discovered an error in several past 
releases.  In preparing the releases, we inadvertently neglected to remove 
duplicate listings of several objects from the online catalogs.  Several 
of the secondary observations of the objects included are of lower 
photometric quality than the primary observation and thus photometric 
zeropoints derived with them may shift slightly.  We removed all duplicate 
observations from  the online catalogs for past 
bursts located at http://mizar.as.arizona.edu/grb/public/.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
