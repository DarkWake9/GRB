The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:27:36 UT on 4 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211204A (trigger 660281261.437168 / 211204144).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 35.4, Dec = -49.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 21m, -49d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59.0 degrees.
