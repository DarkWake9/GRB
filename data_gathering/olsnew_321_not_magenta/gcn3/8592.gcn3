A. von Kienlin (MPE)  
reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 05:04:40.72  UT on 30 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor 
triggered and located GRB 081130 (trigger 249714281 / 081130212).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 37.0, DEC = +46.0 (J2000 degrees, 
equivalent to 02h 28m, 46d 00'), with an uncertainty 
of 5.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.

Since the source is soft and weak, the time-averaged spectrum 
is poorly constrained."
