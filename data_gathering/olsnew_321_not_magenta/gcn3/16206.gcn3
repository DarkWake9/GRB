SUBJECT: GRB 140502A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    14/05/02 19:51:41 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1615 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 3 UVOT
images for GRB 140502A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 319.18818, +48.97021 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 21h 16m 45.16s
Dec (J2000): +48d 58' 12.7"

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
