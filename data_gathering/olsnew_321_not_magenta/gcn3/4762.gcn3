report on GRB 060213.


GRB 060213 occurred at about 13:11:09 UT.  It was observed by Konus, 
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Suzaku (WAM), Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), and 
Swift (BAT).  Ulysses was off, and the burst was outside of the field 
of view of Swift-BAT, so it was not imaged.

It was a bright, single FRED with a duration ~ 60 sec.  The position 
has been triangulated to RA, Dec 141.60, -9.15 (J2000).  The corners 
of the 3 sigma error box are:

141.46,  -9.45
141.50,  -9.43
141.74,  -8.85
141.70,  -8.87

The area of this error box is ~57 sq. arcmin.

Konus-Wind spectral analysis is in progress.  Preliminary analysis 
indicates that Epeak was ~1 MeV.
