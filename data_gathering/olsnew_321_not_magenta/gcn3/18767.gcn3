follow-up collaboration:

We observed V404 Cyg after Swift BAT trigger 668097 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 
18716) with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory. Observations 
started on Dec., 28 (UT) 16:19:10. We obtained several unfiltered images of 
60 s exposure. The source has a flare during our observations, the maximal 
brightness of the source during our observations is 15.5m at (UT) 16:22:39. 
It is also apparent that we observed only a small episode of new flaring 
activity of V404 Cyg.
