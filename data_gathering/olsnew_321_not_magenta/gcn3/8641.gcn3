reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 14:29:30.69  UT on 06 December 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 081206B (trigger 250266571 / 081206604). 
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, 
is RA = 346.2, Dec = -33.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 
J2000 23h 05m, -33d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.2 degrees 
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally 
a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). 

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 82 degrees. 

The GBM light curve shows a single peak with a duration of about 10 s. Since

the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
