A.Melandri, C.G. Mundell,  S. Kobayashi, C.J. Mottram, I.A. Steele, 
R.J. Smith, D. Carter, D. Bersier, M.F. Bode (Liverpool JMU) report:


The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically followed up GRB 061110B 
(Fox et al. GCN 5800, trigger=238174) beginning 20.0 min after the 
GRB trigger time (UT:22:18:45.51).

We find a fading source with R=19.5 +/- 0.3 mag (T+25 min) located at

RA = 21:35:40.4
Dec = +06:52:34.1 (0.5" uncertainty)

that we identify as the possible optical afterglow of GRB061110B.
Magnitude was estimated with respect to USNO B1 catalog.

Further observations are on going.
