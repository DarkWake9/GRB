on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

In the Insight-HXMT light curves of SGR 1935+2154 we reported
in Atel #13687 & #13696 and GCN #27675, the reference time (denoted as T0)
of the burst is 14:34:24.5000 UT of April 28. Here we clarify that it is
the arrival time at the Insight-HXMT satellite. Considering the position
of the satellite in the geocentric coordinate system, the arrival time at
the satellite is 11.443 ms earlier than the geocentric time, which means
that T0 at the geocenter is 14:34:24.5114 UT of April 28, 2020.
