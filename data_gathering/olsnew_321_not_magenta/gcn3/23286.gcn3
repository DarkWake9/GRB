Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180930A (trigger #864584)
(Tohuvavohu, et al., GCN Circ. 23279).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 76.894, -25.124 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  05h 07m 34.6s 
  Dec(J2000) = -25d 07' 25.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 87%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single episode of weak emission from 
T-4 sec to T+4 sec with several peaks. T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.80 +- 0.95 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.24 to T+4.20 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.86 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
