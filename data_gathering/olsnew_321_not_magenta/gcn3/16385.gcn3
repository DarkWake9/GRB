Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 16:31:28.58 UT on 10 June 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140610A (trigger 424110691 / 140610689)
which was also detected by Swift BAT (Evans et al. 2014, GCN 16375).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with Swift's location.

The GBM light curve shows a long burst, consisting of one main episode,
with a total duration (T90) of about 134.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.048 s to T0+133.122 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.32 +/- 0.08 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 169 +/- 24 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.2 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.00 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 2.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
