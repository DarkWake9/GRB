TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3608
SUBJECT: GRB 050714A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    05/07/14 01:31:23 GMT

B. Schaefer (Louisiana State), S.A. Yost (U Mich), H. Swan (U Mich), E.S. 
Rykoff (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe, 
Turkey, responded to GRB 050714A (Integral trigger 2598), producing images 
beginning 9.1 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the 
first image at 00:06:33.1 UT, 27.9 s after the burst, under excellent 
conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 60 60-sec eposures. These 
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma error circle, for both single images and coadding into sets of 10. 
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.5-17.9; we set 
the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
