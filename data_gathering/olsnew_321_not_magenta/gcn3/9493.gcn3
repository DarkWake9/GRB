Markku Nissinen (Taurus Hill Observatory) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus
Hill Observatory) report:

We used Global-rent-a-scope GRAS001 Tak Mewlon 0.30m telescope with FLI 
IMG1024 Dream Machine at RAS Observatory Mayhill H06 (New Mexico, USA) 
for follow-up observations of GRB090607 (F. E. Marshall et al., GCN 9491).
The observations were started on June 7, at 06:11 UTC (1.0 hours after the
burst) and stopped on June 7, at 07:12 UTC. Three unfiltered 120s and two
unfiltered 600s images were taken. We did not find any new object in the
XRT error circle. Upper limit for the observations is >18.5 mag (3UL).
Quoted upper limit has been derived using POSSII J and USNO-B1.0 field 
stars as reference.
