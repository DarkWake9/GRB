We observed the field of GRB 181202A (Cannizzo et al., GCN 23482) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/12 3.09 to 2018/12 3.11
UTC (19.43 to 20.04 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
0.09 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.12 hours exposure in the
Z, Y, J, and H bands in poor conditions.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper
limits:

 r	> 19.18
 i	> 19.17
 Z	> 16.52
 Y	> 16.30
 J	> 16.00
 H	> 16.31

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

However, we note that in our optimally-combined all-filter image, there
appears to be a very faint source present in the Swift-XRT error circle.
This suggests that there may be a source present at low significance in
at least some of our individual images.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
