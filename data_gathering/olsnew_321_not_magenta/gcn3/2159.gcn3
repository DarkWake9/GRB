TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2159
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030421 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 02192 seconds.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 170 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.3E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.6E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 333.729, -38.892 degrees, whose radius is 51.349 +/-  0.018
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
