At 12:48:28 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070529 (trigger=280706).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 283.750, +20.639 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 55m 00s
   Dec(J2000) = +20d 38' 21"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure at least 40 seconds long.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:50:39 UT, 131 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a moderately bright, uncatalogued X-ray source. 
From downlinked data, we determined the position RA, Dec 283.7427, +20.6586 
which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 54m 58.26s
   Dec(J2000) =  +20d 39' 31.04"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 76 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position,
within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image
was 7.2e-10 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 400 seconds with the V filter
starting 134 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is an afterglow
candidate with V=17.4 mag located at RA, Dec 283.7425, +20.6594 which
is     
   RA(J2000) = 18h 54m 58.19s     
   Dec(J2000) = 20d 39' 34.0"  with
an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). The 2.7'x2.7'
sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle.   No correction has been
made for the expected extinction of about 1.0 magnitudes.
