We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 070411 (Moretti et al., GCN
6267), using the NOT, VLT, TNG, and WHT telescopes, in the R band.

Observations were carried out at several epochs, between 0.04 and 8 days
after the burst. Analysis of the light curve reveals a clear steepening at
~1 day after the GRB. The late-time slope alpha ~ 1.4 is well constrained
by our measurements (see also Ferrero et al., GCN 6319), and has a value
flatter than expected from post-jet break models (alpha >~ 2).

We encourage observations at X-ray wavelengths to test for the presence of
any break in the X-ray light curve.

We acknowledge support from the observers and the staff at the NOT, VLT,
TNG, and WHT telescopes.
