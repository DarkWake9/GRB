A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO), F. Aceituno, A.J. Castro-Tirado
(IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 080810 (Page et al.
GCN 8080) with the 1.5m OSN telescope at Sierra Nevada
Observatory (Granada, Spain), covering the range between
11.93 and 15.11 hours after the burst in B, V, R and I bands.
We observe a continuous decay following a slope of
alpha = -1.11+/-0.02, consistent with the slope provided by
Rykoff et al. (GCN 8084). Preliminary analysis shows the
following magnitudes in an intermediate epoch as compared
to reference stars derived from the SDSS.

t-t0(h)  Filter      Mag
 13.82     B     21.4 +/- 0.3
 13.62     V     20.2 +/- 0.2
