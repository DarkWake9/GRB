Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210807A (trigger #1064221)
(Lien et al., GCN Circ. 30600).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 76.666, 58.257 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 06m 39.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +58d 15' 25.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 28%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~200 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 156.30 +- 214.60 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from -19.544 to 640.052 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.26 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.5 +- 0.4 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+70.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
