on behalf of the Swift team:

At 14:06:43 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located possible GRB 051127
(trigger=165579).  Due to an Earth limb constraint, the s/c did not slew
to the location.  It will automatically slew 41 min later on the next orbit.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 223.736d,+51.340d
{14h 54m 57s,+51d 20' 23"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  At this time (because of no slew),
all we have is the BAT lightcurve which shows nothing compelling.
We can not rule out the GRB nature of this trigger, but it does not seem likely.
We will not know anything more until the full data set arrives
which will be in 2-3 hours.
