In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger G274296 (GCN #20689) we performed an
analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different
timescales. On LIGO trigger time (T0= 2017-02-17 06:05:55.050 UT) the GRID
exposure covered about 35% of the LIGO localization region that was observed
with off-axis angles between 10 and 70 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 30 MeV - 10 GeV was performed on
timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0. Preliminary values of 3-sigma
upper limits obtained within the accessible G274296 localization region are
reported below:

1.3e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s,
3.0e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
