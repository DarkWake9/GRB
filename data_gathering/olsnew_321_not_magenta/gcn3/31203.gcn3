WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 211211A (Trigger 1088940)

starting at Dec. 11, 13:46:25 UT. We detected an uncataloged

optical afterglow candidate at position (error ~0.5"):

RA:  14:09:10.09  (J2000)

Dec: +27:53:18.23 (J2000)

We estimate the clear band magnitude ~20.3 in out clear band image

at ~0.63 hours after burst. We can not estimate the variability

at this time, further observations are encouraged.

We also notice the afterglow candidate location is very close to a

SDSS galaxy (SDSS ID: 1237665429707096375, with r = 19.53 mag),

it is unclear if the galaxy is related to the GRB.
