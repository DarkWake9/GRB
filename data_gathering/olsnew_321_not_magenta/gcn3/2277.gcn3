behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), and
Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 85670 seconds.  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10 seconds, a 25-100 keV
fluence of approximately  1.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  9.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary, 3 sigma error
boxes each with approximate area 1020 square arcminutes, whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  12 h  6 m 29.49 s    -36 o 17 '  27.67 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 12 h  7 m 17.26 s    -36 o 14 '  49.41 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 11 h 53 m 34.30 s    -37 o 28 '  50.84 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 12 h 18 m 10.77 s    -35 o  3 '  43.37 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 12 h  5 m 41.49 s    -36 o 20 '   5.16 " 

                                       OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   6 h 28 m 35.36 s    -19 o 38 '  41.14 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5:  6 h 28 m  0.96 s    -19 o 32 '  51.16 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6:  6 h 37 m  4.07 s    -21 o 40 '  59.82 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7:  6 h 20 m 56.12 s    -17 o 40 '  50.73 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 8:  6 h 29 m  9.93 s    -19 o 44 '  31.80 " 

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further processing.
These error boxes may be improved.
