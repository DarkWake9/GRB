K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 21541 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  10 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 2.237, -35.258 degrees, whose radius is 85.862 +/-  0.017
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
