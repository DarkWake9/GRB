report:

Following the HETE-2 ground-based analysis position
for GRB 030324 (trigger 2641), we have gotten a 300-s
R-band image with the 2.2-m CAHA telescope (+CAFOS,  
16' diameter FOV) at the German-Spanish Calar Alto 
Observatory in Southern Spain. The frame covers 90% of 
the HETE-2 14' diameter error box (missing a 2' ring
at the border towards the NW of it) and it was taken 
starting at 04:41:43 UT (i.e.about 1.5 hr after the 
onset of the event). No obvious counterpart is found 
down to R = 20, when comparing with the DSS-2 (R-band). 
Further near-IR and deeper optical observations would 
be potentially interesting.
