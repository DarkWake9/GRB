O. Trondal (otrondal@online.no) Oslo, Norway reports:

"I observed the error region of GRB041218 for the INTEGRAL burst GRB041218
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 2858) with my 25cm Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and
unfiltered CCD (MX916) under clear sky conditions.

I took 8 unfilterd 60 s images. The afterglow reported by Torii (GCN 2860)
and Gorosabel et. al. (GCN 2861) is visible in the co-added image at RA
01:39:07.57  Dec +71:20:28.5 (2000.0, USNOA2.0 reference, average residual
0.4 arc secs), at magnitude V=18.6 +/- 0.2 using the field calibration by
Henden (GCN 2896).

The observation started 16:07:04 UT and ended 16:15:51 UT on December 18,
2004.
