V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), V. Kumar (IUCAA), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of Astrosat data showed the CZTI detection of GRB160824B (Fermi-GBM detection: R. Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 19856).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows a single peak at 14:21:13.5 UT, 1.5 seconds after Fermi Trigger at 14:21:12 UT. The peak count rate was 388.49 counts/sec above the background (four quadrants summed together), with a total of 992 counts. The local mean background count rate was 120.0 counts/sec. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 2.9 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb . CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
