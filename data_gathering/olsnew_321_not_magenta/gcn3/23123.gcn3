Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180809B (trigger #852553)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 23105).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 299.712, -15.293 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  19h 58m 50.8s
  Dec(J2000) = -15d 17' 34.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 63%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-36 s and ends at ~T+80 s, followed by another pulse that starts
at ~T+200 s and ends at ~T+250 s. The total burst emission ends at ~T+300 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 233.2 +- 1.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).

We note that the later pulse overlaps with the XRT flare and some ground-based
optical observations (e.g. Tiurina et al.; GCN #23113), which indicates an increase
 in the optical magnitude from Mag 16.5 to 15.5 at the pulse time.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-36.1 to T+302.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.26 +- 0.02.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+35.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 26.3 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
