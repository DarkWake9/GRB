FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol (University of
Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 061007 afterglow at 4.8, 8.6 and
19 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at October 12 10.87 UT
to 16.78 UT, i.e. 5.03 - 5.28 days after the burst (GCN 5707).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical afterglow
(GCN 5706). The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
location of the optical afterglow is -1 +/- 43 microJy at 4.8 GHz,
-37 +/- 46 microJy at 8.6 GHz, and -1 +/- 47 microJy at 19 GHz.

We would like to thank the staff of the Australia Telescope National
Facility, in particular Philip Edwards, for obtaining these
Target of Opportunity observations."
