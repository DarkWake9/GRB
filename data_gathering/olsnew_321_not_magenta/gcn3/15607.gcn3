S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), E.Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, 
D.Malishev (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a short gamma ray burst lasting about 0.8 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 16:54:37  UT of 24 December.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 296.8337  deg
DEC.= +31.6677  deg

with an uncertainty of 2    arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 1 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 0.1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 3x10e-8 
erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
