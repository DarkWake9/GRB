collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 201006A (Gropp et al., GCN Circ.
28560) using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell
Discovery Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ. Observations started on
October 7, 11:50:54 UT (1.44 days after the Swift trigger) taking 3
exposures of 150 s each with SDSS i filter. Observations were taken at
an airmass of about 1.19 and seeing of about 0.5".
We do not find any source inside the enhanced XRT position  (Goad et
al., GCN Circ. 28562) down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of i>23.8
AB mag.
Magnitudes are calibrated against the PanSTARRS catalog and not corrected
for Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
