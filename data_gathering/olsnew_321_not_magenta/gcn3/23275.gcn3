report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:




At 2018-09-25T14:37:27.900 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected

GRB 180925A(trigger ID: HEB180925609) in a routine search of the data,

which was also triggered by Swift-BAT (Gropp et al.,GCN 23268).




The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a bright

pulse with a duration (T90) of 23.23 s measured from T0-2.82 s.

The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+1.8640 s, is 1845.76 cnts/sec.

The total counts from this burst is 10107.89 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the

regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).

Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate

the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside

of the telescope.




The analysis results presented above are preliminary,

final results will be published elsewhere.




Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was

fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and

the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
