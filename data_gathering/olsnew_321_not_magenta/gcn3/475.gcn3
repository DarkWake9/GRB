S.N. Dodonov, V.L. Afanasiev, V.V. Sokolov, A.V. Moiseev (SAO-RAS)
and Alberto J. Castro-Tirado (INTA, Madrid and IAA, Granada) report:

"A BTA/MPSF 4500-s spectrum of the optical transient of
GRB 991208 (GCN #452)  was obtained on
14.14 Dec 1999 UT with the the SAO-RAS 6-m telescope.
The observational conditions on 14 Dec were already given in GCN #461.
The data were obtained with
the integral field spectrograph (Multi Pupil Fiber Spectrograph,
MPFS, http://www.sao.ru:8100/~gafan/devices/mpfs/mpfs_main.htm )
with 300 lines/mm grating blazed at 6000 A  giving a spectral resolution
of about 5 A/pix and effective wavelength coverage of 4100 - 9200 A.
Emission lines at lambda = 6350 A, 8550 A and 8470 A are present,
with the most likely identifications of these emission lines being:
[OII] 3727 A, [OIII] 4959,5007 A at a redshift of z = 0.707 +/-0.002,
presumably that of the host galaxy.

This message may be cited."
