Ulysses, HETE-FREGATE, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 74617
seconds.  (HETE trigger number 2523).  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately  1 second, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  1.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
8.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA,
Decl(2000)=2.001, -37.527 degrees, whose radius is 58.137 +/-  0.024
degrees (3 sigma ).  

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -14 and +6 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl= 287, -37 and 302, -14
degrees, and between RA, Decl= 47, +3 and 24, +17 degrees.

Further improvements to this localization are possible.
