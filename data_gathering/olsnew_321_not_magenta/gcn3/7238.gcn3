W. Li and A. V. Filippenko, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf
of the KAIT GRB team, report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080129 detected by Swift (trigger 301981;
Immler et al. GCN 7226) with the robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging
Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory. The automatic sequence was not 
executed due to poor weather, but a manual sequence was observed remotely.
In total, 14 x 20 s  unfiltered observations were observed. Our first 20 s
image started at 6:11:31 UT, 286 s after the GRB trigger. We did not detect 
the optical/NIR afterglow candidate reported by Bloom (GCN 7229) and
Kruehler et al. (GCN 7231) to a limiting magnitude of 17.9 (calibrated to 
USNO B1). A 200 s co-added image with the middle exposure time at 643 s 
after the GRB trigger did not detect the afterglow candidate to a limiting
magnitude of 20.0.
