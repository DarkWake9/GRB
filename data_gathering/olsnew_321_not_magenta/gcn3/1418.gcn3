D. A. Frail (Caltech/NRAO) and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2002 June 1.16, 3.15 and 4.17 UT the VLA was used to image the
original IPN error box of GRB 020531 (GCN 1402) at a frequency of 4.86
GHz.  Observations were also conducted at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2002
June 4.23 UT.  No sources were detected within the entire IPN error box at
4.86 GHz above a 5-sigma level of 255 microJy at any epoch.

Further, an image was made by combining all three 4.86 GHz epochs and a
search was conducted for radio emission at the positions of the 10 Chandra
X-ray sources (GCN 1415).  No radio sources brighter than 100 microJy
(~3-sigma) at 4.86 GHz and 180 microJy (~3-sigma) at 8.46 GHz, were found
coincident with the Chandra sources.

These limits are two to three times deeper than previous searches for
short durations bursts with the VLA (Hurley et al. ApJ, 567, 447, 2002)."
