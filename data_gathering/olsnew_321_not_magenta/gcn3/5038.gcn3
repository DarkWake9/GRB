S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The short hard GRB 060427B localized by IPN (Golenetskii et al.,
GCN 5030) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=85912.029 s UT (23:51:52.029).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had the fluence 4.95(-3.53,+0.71)x10^-6 
erg/cm2, and the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.012 s
4.30(-3.27, +1.27)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst integrated from T0 to T0+0.128 s is well 
fitted (in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.573 (-0.404,  +0.284)
and Ep = 1746 (-582, +962) keV (chi2 = 24.5/22 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
