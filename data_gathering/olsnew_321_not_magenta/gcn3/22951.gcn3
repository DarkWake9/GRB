Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180715A (trigger #848048)
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 22947).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 235.085, -0.899 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 40m 20.5s
  Dec(J2000) = -00d 53' 57.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 85%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-0.1 and ends at ~T+0.6, The two peaks occur at ~T+0.1 and ~T+0.5,
respectively. T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.68 +- 0.09 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.14 to T+0.63 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.74 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.26 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
