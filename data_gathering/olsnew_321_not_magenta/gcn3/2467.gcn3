Laura Tomas on behalf of the XMM-Newton Science 

Operations Center, report:

XMM-Newton will serendipitously observe the sources 

reported in GCN 2464 (M.Santos-Lleo and P.Calderon) 

during an upcoming scheduled calibration observation 

of Zeta Puppis. The sources are about 10 arcmin 

off-axis and therefore well within the field of 

view. 

The observation is planned to start at 17:53 UT, 

on December 6, 2003, for an exposure time of 

62000 seconds.
