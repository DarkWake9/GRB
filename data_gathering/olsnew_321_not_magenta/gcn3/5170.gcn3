E. Berger and M. Gladders (Carnegie) report:

"We obtained a spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB 060526 (GCN 5162)
with the LDSS3 spectrograph on the Magellan/Clay telescope starting on
2006, May 27.06 UT.  The spectrum reveals a strong aborption feature which
we identify as Ly-alpha, as well as a large number of aborption features
corresponding to SII, SiII, CII, FeII, etc., at a redshift of 3.21.  
Further analysis is on-going"
