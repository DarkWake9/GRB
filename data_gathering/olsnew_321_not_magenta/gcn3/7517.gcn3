K. Wiersema, N. Tanvir (University of Leicester), P. Vreeswijk, J. Fynbo 
(DARK Cosmology Centre), R. Starling, E. Rol (Leicester) and P. Jakobsson 
(Hertfordshire) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 080319C (GCN 7442) with Gemini North, 
using the GMOS-N instrument. We took spectra using the B600 grism 
(exposure time 4 x 900s) in bad weather conditions: exposures were taken 
through holes in the cloud deck. Observations started at 14:51 UT on
March 19th.

The spectrum shows several absorption lines of C IV, Al II, Si II, Al III, 
Mg I and the CrII / ZnII blend. From these we find the redshift z = 1.95.

We are very grateful to the Gemini staff, in particular Paul Hirst, for 
executing these observations.
