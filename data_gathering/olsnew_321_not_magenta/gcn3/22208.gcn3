and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171106A (Fermi-GBM trigger #531662214,
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7958, Konus-Wind trigger time on 11:56:50.118) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:56:48.57 on 6 November 2017.
The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows several peaks.  The emission starts at T+2 sec,
peaks at T+4 sec and ends at T+13.5 sec.  The weak 2nd and 3rd peaks are visible at
T+7 sec and T+12 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
1.8 +- 0.2 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
