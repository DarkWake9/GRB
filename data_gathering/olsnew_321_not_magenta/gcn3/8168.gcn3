Joseph D. Gelfand (NYU / NSF), Gregory Taylor (UNM), Chryssa Kouveliotou

(NASA/ORAU) report:

A VLA observation of SGR 0501+4516 (GCN 8113) on 2008 August 31 between 
1109 UT and 1358 UT did not detect a radio source at the position reported 
in GCN 8148 at 4.8 GHz, the only frequency used during this observation. 
The resultant five sigma upper-limit on the radio emission during this 
period is < 0.1 mJy (rms = 20 uJy).  We would like to thank NRAO for 
promptly scheduling these VLA observations.
