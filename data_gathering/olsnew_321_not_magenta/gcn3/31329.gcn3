The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:29:15 UT on 29 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211229A (trigger 662441360.901398 / 211229145).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 295.0, Dec = 22.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 40m, 22d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 94.0 degrees.
