The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:32:44 UT on 11 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210411B (trigger 639840769.632692 / 210411564).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 115.7, Dec = -74.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 42m, -74d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
