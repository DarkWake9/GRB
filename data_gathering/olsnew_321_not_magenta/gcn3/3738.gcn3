" We have imaged the entire error region of GRB 050802 (Band et
al. #3734) using the imaging polarimeter PICO with Lulin One-meter
Telescope. After end of twilight, the observation was started at 12:42
(0.107 days after the burst).  We have obtained 12 x 300 sec i'-band
images. These images show no optical counterpart brighter than
i'=17.2. These 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are derived from the
USNO-B1.0 catalog.
