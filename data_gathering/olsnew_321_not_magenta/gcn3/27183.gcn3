D. Svinkin and K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 200224C (The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 27178)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 604231129) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 35925 s UT (09:58:45).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=205.247 deg (13h 40m 59s) Dec(2000)=+54.669 deg (+54d 40' 10"),
whose radius is 82.665 +/- 2.948 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi GBM one.

This localization may be improved.
