INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

These two events were detected quasi-simultaneously, in such a way that
their time histories overlapped, making the analysis very difficult,
and the results subject to large uncertainties.

GRB031127A was about 10 s long and arrived at 68338 s.  It was detected
by Konus-Wind, RHESSI, and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.  This event can only be
localized very coarsely.  Triangulation gives an annulus centered at
RA, Decl(2000)=21.275, -60.447 degrees, whose outer radius is
approximately 70 degrees and whose inner radius is zero degrees.  The
Konus ecliptic latitude determination limits the arrival direction to
ecliptic latitudes between -60 degrees and -20 degrees.

GRB031127B was over 70 s long and arrived at 68356 s.  This event was
detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL SPI-ACS, Mars Odyssey - HEND, and
Helicon.  We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at RA,
Decl(2000)=350.166, -5.279 degrees, whose radius is 73.555 +/- 1.271
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival direction to ecliptic latitudes between +30 and +70
degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus between RA,
Decl=276, +6 and 291, +50 degrees, and between 316, +62 and 49, +49
degrees.

These two localizations are definitely mutually exclusive.  They may be
improved slightly, but a small error box cannot be derived for either
event.
