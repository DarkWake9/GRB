We investigated serendipitous INTEGRAL observations carried out at the
time of the LIGO/Virgo burst candidate G298048.  The satellite was
covering a fraction of the probability of the LIGO-Virgo
localization. The best sensitivity depends on the source location.

We investigated the SPI-ACS light curves between -30 and +30 s from
the trigger time (2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC, T0) on temporal scales from
0.1 to 100s.

In the SPI-ACS data, we detect a short and relatively weak transient
with S/N of at T0, with an S/N larger than 3. coincident with the GBM
trigger (Connaughton 2017, GCN 21506). Further analysis is ongoing,
and will be reported in the coming circulars.
