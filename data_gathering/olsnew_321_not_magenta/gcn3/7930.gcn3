The long GRB 080625 (SuperAGILE ; Marco et al., GCN 7903)
was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 12:28:41 UT on 25 July 2008 (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a single peak, starting at T0s, ending
at T0+62s with a duration
(T90) of about 62 seconds. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 2.3(+1.3/-0.7) E-6 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+33s was 0.4(+0.2/-0.3) photons/cm^2/s in the same
energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-15s to
T0+50s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 1.7 (+1.2/-0.8) (chi^2/d.o.f = 9.6/8) at the 120 - 500 keV bandpass.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
