The long GRB 200215A (Swift detection: Bernardini et al., GCN Circ. 27079,
Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 27098; Fermi GBM detection: Poolakkil and
Meegan, GCN Circ. 27087) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 14:39:28.087 UTC on 15 February 2020.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T+0.1 sec, peaks at T+4.0 sec and ends at T+8.3 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 7.1 +- 1.6 sec
and 2.2 +- 1.5 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
