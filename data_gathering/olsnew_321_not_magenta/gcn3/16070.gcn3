Subject: GRB 140402A: Fermi GBM detection

Peter A. Jenke (UAH) and Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:10:07.00 UT on 02 April 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140402A (trigger 418090209 / 140402007).
It was also detected by Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi et al. 2014, GCN 16069).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 0.3 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s
to T0+0.064 s is well fit by a simple power law function with index -1.2 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.0 +/- 0.4)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.6 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
