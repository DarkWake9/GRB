"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 060105 (GCN 4429) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 09:13:18 UT on Jan.05.
After co-adding a set of 15 images (09:13:18 - 09:31:05 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter 
than 16.1mag."
