We observed the locations of four transients reported from DECam
searches of the localization region (GCN #25336, #25360, #25362,
#25373, #25393) of LIGO / Virgo S190814bv (GCN #25324) with the
Wide-field Infrared Camera (WIRC; Wilson et al. 2003) on the Palomar
200-inch Hale telescope. Observations were carried out between UT
2019-08-18 11:15 and 12:15, and consisted of a series of dithered
exposures on the target fields in J band. The data were reduced and
stacked using a custom reduction pipeline for WIRC (De et al. in prep)
and we report preliminary magnitude estimates for the targets.

Notes:
(1) Transient is detected offset from host galaxy although host
contamination cannot be ruled out
(2) Transient visible on top of host galaxy, but magnitude estimates
are contaminated with host galaxy light before template subtraction
(3) Transient close to bright host nucleus, so no reliable transient
photometry could be extracted before template subtraction
