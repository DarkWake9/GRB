K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and M. De Pasquale (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

In GCN Circ. 14937, Page, Oates & De Pasquale reported the Swift detection
of a weak X-ray source within the BAT error circle of GRB 130626A.
Follow-up observations of this source, obtained between 5.8 x 10^5 and 1.3
x 10^6 s after the trigger, show it is still detected, at a level of (1.3
+/- 0.3) x 10^-3 count s^-1, compared to the initial detection of (2.0
+0.5/-0.4) x 10^-3 count s^-1 (errors at the 1-sigma confidence level).
Since the source has not faded significantly over this long time span, we
do not believe it to be the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130626A.

The 90% upper limit for any other source within the BAT error circle is 8
x 10^-4 count s^-1, corresponding to a flux of 3 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1,
assuming a typical counts-to-observed-flux conversion factor of 4 x 10^-11
erg cm^-2 count^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
