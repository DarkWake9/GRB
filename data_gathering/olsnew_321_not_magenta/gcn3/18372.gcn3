Further to GCN 18362, and the Pan-STARRS wide-field search of the
accessible area of the northern ALIGO/VIRGO area. We report
a spectrum of the transient PS15cci. Thomas Kupfer took a
25min exposure with the Palomar 200-inch and DBSP on 2015-09-25
covering 3200-9000 Angs.

This transient is in the faint dwarf galaxy
SDSS J091322.78+061047.6,  and clear emission lines from the host
([OII] 3727, [OIII] 5009, H-alpha) are detected at z=0.055 (
giving M_r ~ -17 for the host),

The transient is a type Ia supernova with SNID suggesting
a good match with a 1991T-like SN at an epoch of a few days before peak
brightness.

PS15cci lies within the 90% contour of the LIB area, and to date has been
the only candidate within this contour (in the northern probability region).
Pan-STARRS continues to observe the accessible north-western
spur of the ALIGO/VIRGO LIB region (nightly when weather allows),
pushing eastwards as far as possible.
