TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1947
SUBJECT: GRB 030324 optical observations

W. Li, S. Jha, R. Chornock, and A. V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley), report
that unfiltered images of a 12 arcmin x 12 arcmin region centered at the
position of GRB 030324 (HETE Trigger #2641; 13h37m11s -00d19'22" J2000),
covering roughly 90% of the HETE WXC error circle, were taken with the
Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at 06:18 UT (about 3 hours
after the burst) and show no obvious new source compared with the DSS II
(red) to a limiting magnitude of 19.5 mag, consistent with the results of
Guzyi et al. (GCN 1945).
