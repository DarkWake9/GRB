MASTER Tunka  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB170522A  36 sec after notice time 
and 136 sec after trigger time at 2017-05-22 15:47:51 UT. On our first 
(30s exposure)  set we  do not OT within GBM 
FERMI  error-box  (ra=135.417 dec=27.0394 r=1.26 see Stanbro and Meegan 
GCN #21126 ) brighter then 16.2.

Unfortunately this observation was outside of the future Fermi LAT 
(Arimoto and  Racusin, GCN #21127) error box.

Fortunatelly, we have MASTER Very Wide field cameras on all telescopes 
(5-10 
sec exposure on  2x380 square degrees FOV) and we have images with future 
Fermi LAT (Arimoto and  Racusin, GCN #21127) error box.  There is no OT 
brighter ~12 mag inside the future Fermi LAT error box.

The observations made on zenit distance = 66 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
40 degree. The moon (14 % bright part) below the horizon (The altitude of 
the Moon is  -32 degree ). Observations started at twilight.
The sun  altitude  is -15.9 degree.
The area can be observed till sunrise at 2017-05-22 21:04:48

MASTER SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in SAAO was automaticaly starting survey on the FERMI  GRB170522A 
error-box (ra=09 01 47 dec=+27 07 12 r=1 Fermi GBM error box Stanbro and 
Meegan GCN #21126 )  3186 sec after 
notice time and 3740 sec  after trigger time at 2017-05-22 16:47:55 UT. 
The 5-sigma upper limit on  our first (60s exposure)  set is about 18.7mag
No OT brighter 19.5 detected in SAAO.

The observations made on zenit distance = 62 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
40 degree.
The moon (14 % bright part) below the horizon (The altitude of the Moon is 
-39 degree ).
Observations started at twilight.
The sun  altitude  is -13.9 degree.
The object can be observed till sunrise at 2017-05-23 05:22:11

Unfortunately this observation was outside of the future Fermi LAT
(Arimoto and  Racusin, GCN #21127) error box.

MASTER-OAFA   robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in OAFA automaticaly was pointed to the  GRB170522A 247 sec after 
FERMI LAT notice time (Arimoto and Racusin, GCN #21127)  and 35103 
sec after trigger time at 2017-05-23 01:30:38 UT .
But zenit distance was very high and we received dark images.

On  our 4-th image (923 sec after FERMI
LAT notice time (Arimoto and Racusin, GCN #21127)  and 35779
sec after trigger time at 2017-05-23 01:41:54 UT.)  we 
found 1 short optical transient within LAT 
error-box  (ra=139.338 dec=25.67 r=0.19) brighter then 14.5 .

This object was found only on the one image.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14.5 mag
We did not find OT brighter 18.5 on the next images.

The observations made on zenit distance = 80 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
43 degree. The moon (11 % bright part) below the horizon (The altitude of 
the Moon is -63 degree ). The sun  altitude  is -50.3 degree.
The object can be observed till 2017-05-23 02:44:45 .
