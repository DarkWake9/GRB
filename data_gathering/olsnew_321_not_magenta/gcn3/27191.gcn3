R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift GRB 200224A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 27173) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA site, on February 24, from 12:01 to 12:18 UT (corresponding to 8.62 to 8.90 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel I and R filters.

We performed a series of 5x120s exposures in I and 3x120s in R. We do not detect any sources in the individual frames (nor in stacked images) in the Swift error region.  Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limits:

R > 19.85

I > 19.05

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682
