P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team

The Swift-UVOT observed the field of GRB080218B starting 551 s after the 
BAT trigger (Schady et al., GCN 7314). No new source is detected within 
the refined XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 7320) in any of the UVOT 
co-added observations down to the following 3-sigma upper limits:

Filter  Tmid (s) Exp (s)  Upper Limit
wh      4178     420        > 21.09
v       2955     494        > 19.87
b       4126     283        > 20.24
u       4098     294        > 19.98
uvw1    3984     294        > 19.77
uvm2    3868     313        > 19.67
uvw2    6056     281        > 19.91

where Tmid is the weighted mid time of the co-added observations. The 
values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic extinction 
corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)= 0.17 mag in the direction of the 
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998),
