A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, ISA-UMA), S. Jeong (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC, UPV-EHU) and D. Reverte (GTC, IAC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

“Following the detection of GRB 140713A by Swift (Mangano et al. GCN 16581), we observed the field with the 10.4m GTC telescope starting on July 16, 21:28 UT (i.e. 3.11 days postburst). In the coadded frame (900s in r’) we identify in the outskirts of the enhanced Swift-XRT error box  a m_AB~24 source at RA (J2000): 18h 44m 25.48s and Dec (J2000): +59d 38' 00.5"  which we suggest as the potential host galaxy for this dark GRB, taking into account the previously reported optical limits (Cano et al. GCNC 16587) and the detection of a mm afterglow (Zauderer et al. GCN 16593).”
