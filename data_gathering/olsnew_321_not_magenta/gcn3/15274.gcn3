report:

We observed the field of GRB 130831A (Hagen, et al., GCN 15139) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/09 30.12 to 2013/09 30.49 UTC (29.58 to
29.94 days after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 6.27 hours exposure
in the r and i bands and 2.65 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 15147),
in comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the following detections and upper
limits (3-sigma):

  r     23.84 +/- 0.18
  i     23.23 +/- 0.15
  Z     > 23.04
  Y     > 22.53
  J     > 22.37
  H     > 21.72

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source has faded relative to
our last measurement (t~21.5 days; Lee et al., GCN 15242) by about 0.8
magnitudes in r and J and 0.5 magnitudes in i.  Our measurements (see,
also, Watson et al., GCN 15179; Butler et al., GCN 15165) are consistent
with a bump or re-brightening in the lightcurve at t~10 days (see,
Pozanenko et al., GCN 15237), followed by continued fading.

Mártir.
