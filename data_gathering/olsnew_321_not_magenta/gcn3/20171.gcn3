The long-duration GRB 161109A (Desiante et al., GCN Circ. 20155;
Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 20156; Konus-Wind trigger time on 6:18:43.284)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 6:18:40.56 on
9 November 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows at least four peaks.  The first three peaks
are rather weak, and they peak at T+5 sec, T+10 sec and T+15 sec, respectively.
The forth peak is the brightest, and it starts at T+20 sec, peaks at T+22 sec
and ends at T+32 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
24.8 +- 2.3 sec (40-1000 keV).
