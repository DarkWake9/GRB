BeppoSAX X-ray transient/possible GRB000608

On Jun. 8 at about 08:51:42 UT a burst was detected by
WFC2 (2-26 keV), with a faint signal on GRBM (40-700 keV) 9 s. before.

The refined position is:

R.A.= 6.253
Decl.= -69.034

with an error radius of 4'.

The nature of this transient is still suspect and under analysis (SMC is
at about 4.5 degrees).
A BeppoSAX follow-up is not being planned.
