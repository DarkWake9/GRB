and V. D'Elia report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 130528A (D'Elia  et al. GCN
Circ. 14711),  from 68 s to 22.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 842 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Goad et al. (GCN. Circ 14714).

The late-time light curve (from T0+4.9 ks) can be modelled with  a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.06 (+/-0.12).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.69 (+/-0.07). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.6 (+/-0.3) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 5.2 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.92 (+/-0.15) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 3.6 (+/-0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 4.4 x 10^-11 (6.9 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.6 (+/-0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 5.2 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 8.5 sigma
Photon index:	     1.92 (+/-0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.06, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.013 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.7 x
10^-13 (8.9 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
