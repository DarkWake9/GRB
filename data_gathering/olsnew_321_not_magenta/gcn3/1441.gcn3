report:

We have observed the error-circle of HETE Trigger #2081 with the robotic
MSO 50-inch telescope at 2002 Jun 25.65 UT.  Exposures consisted of 3x300
sec integrations in MACHO R, and cover the entire error circle.  We do not
identify any afterglow candidate on visual comparison with the DSS2 to a
limit approximately R ~ 19.5 mag.
