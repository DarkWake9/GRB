TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2759
SUBJECT: GRB 040924: Second Epoch WSRT Radio Observations
DATE:    04/10/01 12:49:59 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam), E. Rol (University of
Leicester) and R.A.M.J. Wijers (University of Amsterdam) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 040924 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope from September 29 19.06 UT to
September 30 6.81 UT, i.e. 5.30 - 5.79 days after the burst (GCN 2735).
The rms noise in het map around that position is 30 microJy per beam. The
formal flux measurement for a point source at the location of the optical
afterglow (GCN 2734) is 11 +/- 30 microJy.

In conclusion, we do not detect a source at the optical position, in
agreement with our previous WSRT measurements (GCN 2746) and the VLA
measurements (GCN 2758).

No further observations are planned."
