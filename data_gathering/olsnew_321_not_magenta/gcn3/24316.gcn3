J. Stanzin (IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We followed up the localization region of the GW candidate event S190426c
(LVC et al. GCN 24168) with the GROWTH-India telescope. We obtained 37
r-band overlapping images covering a total area of 12.3 square degrees,
with 9.43% probability of containing the GW counterpart. Exposures were 600
seconds long and reached a typical depth of 20.6 magnitude. The field
centers (given below) were chosen in coordination with ZTF and DECAM (GCN
24257) to cover the northernmost part of the sky not accessible to them.
Data processing is underway. These fields contain 332 galaxies from the
GLADE catalog and 6 galaxies from NED. We inspected the NED galaxies
(listed below) and do not find any candidate counterparts near them.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
