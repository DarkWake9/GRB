The optical counterpart of GRB 200205B (Evans et al., GCN 26993; 
Strausbaugh & Cucchiara, GCN 26995; Vielfaure et al., GCN 26998) was 
observed with the ESO New Technology Telescope equipped with the SofI 
imager on two different epochs during the night of 2020 Feb 5-6. 
Observations were carried out under ESO program 0104.D-0945(A) (PI Russell).

The afterglow is well detected in the first epoch in the J and Ks 
filters, and is marginally detected in the second observation. 
Calibrated to the 2MASS survey, we obtain the following magnitudes (Vega):

K = 18.07 +- 0.10  on Feb 6.164 UT  (0.356 days after the GRB)
J = 19.43 +- 0.10  on Feb 6.145 UT  (0.338 days after the GRB)
J = 20.57 +- 0.33  on Feb 6.368 UT  (0.561 days after the GRB)
