We performed J-band tiling observations for the ~40'x40' region
centered at the IceCube alert R.A.=46.58 deg and Dec.=14.98 deg  
(Blaufuss, GCN 20247) with the optical-infrared simultaneous camera
HONIR attached to 1.5m Kanata telescope of Hiroshima University from
13 to 17.5 UT on December 11, 2016. Compared our data with 2MASS
catalog, we found no bright NIR transient in the observed region.
5 sigma limiting magnitude was J=18.8 (preliminary, 2'' aperture).

We also obtained R-band data simultaneously, and the data analysis
is ongoing.
