Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:


"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 070518 (GCN 6415) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2007 May 19th
at 7.41 UT, around 17 hours after the burst. The radio afterglow
of the GRB is undetected at the SWIFT-XRT position (GCN 6421). The
2-sigma uppler limit on the GRB flux density is 64 uJy.
