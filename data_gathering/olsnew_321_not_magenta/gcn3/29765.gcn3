We observed this field with the MASTER-VWFC of MASTER-IAC, covering the Swift/XRT position from 
2021-04-02 22:04:21 to 2021-04-02 22:07:17, i.e. during the prompt emission.
Frames were taken with the exposure time of 5s and with no filter .

Calibrated with NOMAD V-filter, we  marginally see optical source inside 
T90 at 2 images:
started at 2021-04-02 22:05:36(79 from Fermi trigger time) and
at 2021-04-02 22:05:46(89 from Fermi trigger)
with m_OT~11
at XRT position, but the pixel of this camera is 21".

Comparing to the GAIA EDR3, we see no optical counterpart down to the
magnitude of 10.5 at other images. It puts the upper limit on the flux of 
the prompt
optical emission at ~5e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Considering that the x-ray flux
was ~1e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1, we constrain the relation between optical flux
and x-ray flux at ~10^-2.
