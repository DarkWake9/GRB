report on behalf of the NL JCMT collaboration:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 030329 (GCN 1985 and 
following) using the SCUBA sub-millimeter continuum bolometer 
array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope located on Mauna 
Kea, Hawaii.  The observations took place on 2003 Apr 03.4 UT.

Although the conditions were not very good, the source was 
easily detected.  Preliminary calibration gives an 850 micron 
flux density of 30 +/- 5 mJy.

Further observations are planned.
