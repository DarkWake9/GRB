TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8988
SUBJECT: GRB 090313: Sustained optical brightness (correction)
DATE:    09/03/13 13:55:10 GMT
FROM:    Daniel Perley at U.C. Berkeley  <dperley@astro.berkeley.edu>

D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) reports:

In the preceding circular reporting on the continued optical brightness 
at ~3 hours, the reference to Sakamoto et al. (GCN 8982) is in error. 
That circular addresses GRB 090309, not GRB 090313.  As is clear in 
Sakamoto et al. (GCN 8986), this event is clearly a long GRB (T90 = 78 
+- 19 sec).  I apologize for any confusion.
