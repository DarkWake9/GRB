B. A. Zauderer, E. Berger, and T. Laskar (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 130131A (Grupe et al., GCN 14156) with
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy beginning
2013 Feb 1.3 UT (0.7 d post-burst) at a mean frequency of ~85 GHz.
Coincident with the Swift-XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 14160) and
the VLA 5.8 GHz position (Laskar et al., GCN 14171), we report
a preliminary detection of a radio source with a flux of ~0.5 mJy.
Further analysis is in progress.

We thank the CARMA staff for their support."
