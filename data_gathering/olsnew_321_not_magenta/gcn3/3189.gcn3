report:


The HETE FREGATE, WXM, and SXC instruments detected GRB 050408 (=H3711)
at 16:22:50.93 UT (58970.93 SOD) on 8 April 2005.  WXM and SXC flight
localizations were reported in a GCN Notice issued at 16:23:02, which
was 11 sec after the burst trigger and while the burst was still in
progress.

The final WXM and SXC flight localizations were reported in a GCN
Notice issued at 16:23:13 UT.  The final WXM flight localization can be
expressed as a circle of 14 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) that is
centered at

WXM-Flight:  RA = 12h 01m 55s, DEC = +10d 51' 38" (J2000).

The final SXC flight localization can be expressed as a circle of 150
arcseconds radius that is centered at

SXC-Flight:  RA = +12h 02m 15s, DEC = +10d 51' 03" (J2000).


Ground analysis produced an updated SXC localization that was reported
in a GCN Notice issued at 17:36:02.  This ground SXC localization can 
be expressed as a circle of 80 arcseconds radius that is centered at


SXC-Ground:  RA = +12h 02m 15s, DEC = +10d 52' 01" (J2000).


The burst has a duration T_90 of ~34 seconds in 7-40 keV and 7-80 keV,
and T_90 of ~15 seconds in 30-400 keV.  Preliminary spectral analyses
show the 2-30 keV fluence of GRB 050408 to be ~1.4 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and
the 30-400 keV fluence to be ~1.9 x 10-6 ergs cm-2.  Therefore 
GRB 050408 is an "X-ray-rich" GRB.
