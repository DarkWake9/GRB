F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and D. Grupe (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080210 (trigger 302888)
starting 160 seconds  after the BAT trigger 
(Grupe et al., GCN Circ. 7281), which occurred at 07:50:05 UT.
A bright afterglow was seen in the initial 
exposures with the White and V filters
at a position of RA (J2000) of 16h45m04.01s and Dec (J2000) of  
+13o49'35.9" (J2000) with an estimated 90% confidence error radius
of 0.6". This position is consistent with the optical
position reported by Klotz et al. (GCN Circ. 7280) and
the enhanced XRT position reported by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 7285).
There was no 3-sigma detection of the afterglow in
any subsequent exposure in any of the UVOT filters.
The non-detections in the UV filters is consistent with
the redshift of 2.641 reported by Jakobsson et al. 
(GCN Circ. 7286). The lack of detection in the second
exposure with the White filter indicates a decay slope
of steeper than -0.7 assuming a power law decay model.

The detections and 3-sigma upper limits in the UVOT photometric
system (Poole et al. MNRAS 383, 627 (2008)) are summarized in
the following table:

Filter T_start(s) T_stop(s) Exposure(s)  Mag/3-sigma UL

white    160         260      98         18.2 +/- 0.1
white   6081        6244     161        >20.5
v        267         460     190         17.6 +/- 0.1
b       5877       64094    2625        >21.2
u       5671       69878    4779        >21.3
uvw1    3846       69140    5453        >22.3
uvm2    3639       68241    4447        >21.8
uvw2    9469       74958    4171        >22.3

The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.08 mag 
in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
