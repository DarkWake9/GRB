report for the GRACE collaboration:

The optical afterglow, discovered by Peterson & Price (GCN 1974), of
GRB 030328 (HETE trigger 2650, see GCN 1978), was observed around
March 29.08 UT with FORS1 at telescope unit 1 of the VLT. A total of
one hour of spectra were taken with the grism 300V and a slit width of
1 arcsecond, at a position angle of 104 degrees to also include object
B of Price & Peterson (GCN 1975) in the slit.

A preliminary reduction shows significant absorption lines, most of
which we identify with typical metal lines at a redshift of z=1.520.
We also find some hints for another system at z=1.29, but an improved
analysis is needed to confirm this.

We are thankful for the assistance of the ESO staff at Paranal; in
particular that of Andreas Kaufer.
