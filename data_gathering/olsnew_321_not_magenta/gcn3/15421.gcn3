J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift science team:

At 11:33:31 UT, Swift-BAT rate-triggered on GRB 131031A (trigger 576277).  No
significant source was found onboard.  In ground analysis, a significant source
was found at the very edge of the BAT field of view (3% coded).  The location is
RA, Dec 29.618, -1.603, which is:

RA (J2000)    01h 58m 28.3s
Dec (J2000)  -01d 36' 11"

with an estimated error radius of 4 arcmin (90% containment).  This GRB also
triggered Fermi GBM.

The burst was about 8 seconds long, with a multipeaked structure.

A Swift TOO request has been submitted to locate the afterglow with XRT and UVOT.
