We analysed 840 s exposure in Photon Counting mode from
the first orbit of the Swift observation of GRB060403
(Boyd et al. 2006, GCN 4945).
The refined coordinates of the X-ray source are:

    RA(J2000)  =   18 49 21.8  
    Dec(J2000) =  +08 19 45.3

with an estimated uncertainty of 5.5 arcseconds radius
(90% containment). This position is 11 arcseconds from
the preliminary position given in GCN 4945.
The X-ray light curve shows a standard afterglow decay.
Further analysis is on-going.
