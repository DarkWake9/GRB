H. Ohashi, T. Kato, T. Senda, H. Mii, K. Mizuno, Y. Yasaka (Kyoto U)
and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U) report on behalf of VSNET-grb collaboration:

  "We have performed a full analysis of the R band images of GRB 020812
field taken at Ouda (GCN 1469).  Three fields of view (14 arcminutes
square) were observed, each of which covered a part of HETE WXM error
box (GCN 1468) (http://www.rc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~yamaoka/GRB020812/FOVouda.gif).
The limiting magnitudes are measured by compareing with USNO-A2.0 red
magnitudes.  "Coverage" shows the percentage of covered area of the
HETE WXM error box.
