S. Dado and A. Dar report,

The long duration, low luminosity GRB190829A [1] at redshift z=0.0785 [2] 
with Ep=130 +/- 20 keV and Eiso~1.8E50 erg, most probably, is an ordinary 
narrowly beamed GRB being viewed from far off-axis -it satisfies well the 
correlation (1+z)Ep propto (Eiso)^{1/3}, predicted [3] by the cannonball 
model of GRBs, as can be seen from figure 3 of [4].  Like in SHB 170817A
[5], VLA and VLBI follow up observations of the radio afterglow of
GRB190829A may resolve its compact superluminal source and measure its 
apparent superluminal velocity, Vapp ~ 2c/theta, from which  its far 
off-axis viewing angle theta  can be determined [6]. We urge such follow 
up VLA and VLBI radio observations of its afterglow.
