At 12:25:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170714A (trigger=762535).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 34.321, +1.987 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 17m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = +01d 59' 14"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:32:05.3 UT, 392.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 34.3498, 1.9901 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +02h 17m 23.95s
   Dec(J2000) = +01d 59' 24.4"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 104 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the
column density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the U filter starting
869 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.03. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. D'Ai (antonino.dai AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
