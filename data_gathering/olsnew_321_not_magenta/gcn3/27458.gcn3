The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 20:56:48 UT on 27 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200327A (trigger 607035413.165342 / 200327873).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 233.4, Dec = 2.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 33m, 2d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 17.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 109.0 degrees.
