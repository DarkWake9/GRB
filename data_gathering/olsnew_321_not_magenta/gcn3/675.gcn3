a larger collaboration report:

"With reference to the GRB000528 occurred on May 28.366 UT and localized
with the BeppoSAX WFC no. 2 (see BeppoSAX Mails ## 00/10 and 00/11), a
preliminary analysis of the GRBM data shows a complex time profile of
this GRB with two main peaks of decreasing intensity. The peak flux is of
1.7E3 cts/s in the 40-700 keV energy band corresponding to 
1.44 +/- 0.04) x 10^(-6) erg/cm2/s  . The GRB duration is of about 80 s.
A preliminary spectral analysis reveals an evident softening evolution
with an average power law photon index of about 1.9. 
We are now able to derive rough GRB positions from the GRBM data. The GRBM
position obtained for this GRB is R.A.(2000)= 160 and DEC(2000) = -29 with
an error radius of 5 deg, that is fully consistent with that given with
the WFC."
