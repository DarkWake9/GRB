L. Amati (INAF - IASF Bologna),

By assuming the VLT redshift of 1.10 (Vreeswijk et al., GCN 7601), the 
values of spectral parameters alpha and Ep, and the fluence, provided 
by Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et al., GCN 7606), a value of spectral parameter 
beta of -2.3 and a Lambda-CDM cosmology with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M=0.27 
and Omega_Lambda=0.73, the values of Ep,i and Eiso (1-10000 keV 
cosmological rest-frame) of GRB 080413B are approximately 150+/30 keV and 
(2.4+/-0.2)x10^52 erg, fully consistent with the Ep,i-Eiso correlation.

Given that this correlation holds for long GRBs only (see, e.g., Amati, 
MNRAS, 2006; Amati, astroph/0611189), this is a further evidence that
GRB 080412B is not a short GRB.
