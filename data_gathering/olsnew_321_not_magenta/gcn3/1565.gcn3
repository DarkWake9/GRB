At 12:06:13.57 UTC (43573.57 s UT) on 4 Oct 2002, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2380, a long GRB.  The WXM
flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Position
Notice at 12:07:02 UT, 49 sec after the beginning of the burst.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 13:19:54 UT,
73 minutes after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 14.  The WXM
location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 10
arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 47s, Dec = +18d 59' 13" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a further
refinement in the location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice
at 14:39:51 UT, 154 minutes after the burst.  The SXC localization SNR
was 9.  The SXC location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle
that is 2 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 57s, Dec = +18d 55' 44" (J2000).

The SXC localization may be improved.

In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~100 seconds.
In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst also had a duration of ~100
seconds.
