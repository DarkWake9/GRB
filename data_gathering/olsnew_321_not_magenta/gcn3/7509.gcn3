(Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB080319B (Racusin et al., GCN 7427) with the
blue filter (15.8 um) of the IRS peak-up camera on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope.  Observations consisted of 60 pointings, each with two dithered
30 s cycles, beginning at March 21.81 UT (~ 2.55 d after the burst).  At
the location of the optical afterglow, we measure a flux density of 35.7
+/- 3.9 uJy.

We wish to thank the entire Spitzer team for the prompt execution of these
observations.
