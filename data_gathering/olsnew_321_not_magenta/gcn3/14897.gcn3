of the Swift Team:

At 09:44:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130615A (trigger=558271).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 274.846, -68.166 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 19m 23s
   Dec(J2000) = -68d 09' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, there is nothing
obvious in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 09:47:39.3 UT, 174.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 274.82944, -68.16032 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 19m 19.07s
   Dec(J2000) = -68d 09' 37.2"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 30 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (8.27 x
10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 3
(+2.62/-2.27) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 2.11e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
179 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.12.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
