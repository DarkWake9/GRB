Using the data set from T-239 to T+422 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071025 (trigger #295301)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 6986).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 355.065, 31.784 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 40m 15.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 31d 47' 3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad peak composed of several overlapping
subpeaks.  It starts at ~T+0 sec, peaks around T+90 sec, and slowly decays
out to at least T+422 sec.  Because of an observing constraint, the s/c had to slew 
off the burst location, and so we do not have any information on the continuation
of the emission beyond the T+422 sec limit.  T90 (15-350 keV) is at least 109 +- 2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+38.5 to T+193.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.79 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+80.17 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
