A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

The declination given in GCN 12495 was incorrect.

"We observed the position of GRB 111022B (GCN 12472) with the EVLA at
5.8 and 22 GHz beginning on 2011 Oct 23.64 UT (0.92 days after the
burst).  No radio source is detected at 5.8 GHz to a 3-sigma upper limit 
of 30 uJy.  At 22 GHz, a potential radio counterpart was detected with a 
flux of 45+/-14 uJy, consistent with the most up-to-date 1.5'' Swift-XRT 
position (GCN 12478, http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions).  The 
potential radio source centroid is (J2000):

RA  =   07:15:51.53 +/- 0.05
Dec =  +49:41:01.18 +/- 0.37

Follow-up observations at 22 GHz are planned."
