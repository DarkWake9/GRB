J. A. Kennea and M. Stroh (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT Team

We have analyzed downlinked data from the XRT observations of GRB 081012
(Stroh et al, GCN #8361). The XRT began observing the field at 14:00:09 
UT, approximately 49 minutes after the BAT trigger. Data from the first 
orbit of observations reveal an uncatalogued point source at RA, Dec = 
30.20029, -17.63715 which is the equivalent to:

RA(J2000) = 02h 00m 48.0s
Dec(J2000) = -17d 38m 13.7s

with an estimated uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). 
This position is 67 arcseconds from the BAT refined position (Sato et 
al, GCN #8363).
