TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16239
SUBJECT: MAGIC upper limit on the transient from SWIFT Trigger 596958

On 23th April 2014 at 21:08:26 UT, the MAGIC telescopes received a 
GRB-like event alert from Swift (D'Elia et al., GCN16158). It was 
later pointed out that this event was probably not due to a GRB but 
to a flaring star (Xu et al., GCN16159; Drake et al., ATel 6121). 

The MAGIC telescopes started observations of the transient event at 
21:08:54 UT, about 30s after the alert was received, and kept collecting
data for the next 3.3h. 
Data were taken in dark-night and under excellent weather conditions,
at medium-low zenith angles (below 45deg).

A preliminary analysis gave an integral flux upper limit of 1.2e-11 cm-2 s-1
above E>200 GeV at 95% c.l., corresponding to 5.3% of the Crab Nebula flux 
above 200 GeV, assuming a Crab-like spectral index. The intra-minute
light-curve 
above 200 GeV did not show any hint of transient signal.

The MAGIC collaboration is open to collaborate with other teams on this
observation.


MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov 
Telescopes located at the Canary island of La Palma, Spain, and 
designed to perform gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range  from 50 
GeV to more than 50 TeV. Questions regarding the MAGIC observations 
should be directed to Razmik Mirzoyan (Razmik.Mirzoyan@mpp.mpg.de) 
or Alessandro Carosi (alessandro.carosi@oa-roma.inaf.it) and Saverio 
Lombardi (saverio.lombardi@pd.infn.it).
