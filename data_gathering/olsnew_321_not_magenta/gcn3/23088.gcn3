Y.-D. Hu, F.J. Aceituno, J. C. Tello and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC 
Granada), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 180805B (short burst with extended 
emission) by Swift (D'Avanzo et al. GCNC 23076, Sakamoto et al. GCNC 
23082), optical images in the I-band were obtained at the 1.5m OSN 
telescope in Granada (Spain) starting at 03:08 (Aug 6), i.e. ~14 h 
postburst. No optical afterglow is detected in the co-added image (7 x 
300s, mid time at 03:26 UT, 14.4 h after the trigger) within the 
enhanced Swift/XRT error box (Evans et al. GCNC 23077) down to I=21.0, 
which is in agreement with the non-detections reported by Lipunov et al. 
(GCNC 23085), Malesani et al. (GCNC 23086) and Ramsay et al.(GCNC 
23087).
