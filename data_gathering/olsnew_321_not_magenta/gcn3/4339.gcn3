"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 051211A (GCN 3979) with the unfiltered CCD camera 
on the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 11:06:34 UT on Dec.11.
After co-adding a set of 18 images (11:06:34 UT - 11:28:23 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO-A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than 
17.2 mag."
