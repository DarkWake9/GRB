report:

We have observed the 6 sq. degrees field around RXTE-ASM GRB040308 with
MASTER system (355 mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru) equipped with AP16E 4k
by 4k CCD.  We obtained 50 unfiltered images with 30s exposure for each.
No afterglow candidate has been found compared to DSS2 within circular
error box 8 arcmin in diameter. Exposures were taken between 18:40 Mar 10
and 20:00 Mar 10 (48 hours after the burst). The estimated limiting
magnitude (S/N=3) is 21.2 .

Preview image of the whole frame in the jpeg format is available at
