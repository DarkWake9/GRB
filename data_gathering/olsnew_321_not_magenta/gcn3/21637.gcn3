D. Kaplan (UWM), M. Sokolowski (Curtin University), R. Wayth (Curtin University), T. Murphy (University of Sydney), D. Dobie (University of Sydney), C. Lynch (University of Sydney), and K. Bannister (CSIRO) on behalf of the MWA collaboration.

We have observed a 20 x 20 deg field-of-view centered on the  LIGO/Virgo G298048 localization region  (LVC GCN #21513) with the Murchison Widefield Array.  Observations occurred on 2017-08-18, 2017-08-19, 2017-08-20, 2017-08-21, and 2017-08-22, all from roughly 07:00 UT to 09:30 UT, at a central frequency of 185 MHz.  Note that the array is in the process of being reconfigured, so only 5/16 of the tiles are operational.  Analysis of this data is underway, and subsequent epochs are planned.

We thank the MWA Operations team for supporting these observations.
