Using the data set from T-120 to T+285 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080701A (trigger #315615)
(Stroh, et al., GCN Circ. 7910).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 45.944, 75.481 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 03m 46.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +75d 28' 50.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 55%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like peak starting
at ~T-2 sec, peaking at ~T+0 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 18 +- 9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.7 to T+24.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.24 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
