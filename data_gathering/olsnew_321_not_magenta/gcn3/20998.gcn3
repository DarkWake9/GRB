We observed the field of GRB 170405A (Troja et al, GCN 20984;
Hui & Meegan, GCN 20986; Vianello & Kocevski, GCN 20987) with the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) on February the 6th,
starting at 6:15 UT (11.6 hours after the trigger). We
performed a series of exposures in the clear filter. The weather
conditions were good during the observations.

We co-added the exposures taken between 6h15UT (t0+11.6h) and
7h29UT (t0+12.8h), for a total exposure of 3510s. At the position of the 
optical afterglow reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 20988), we do not 
detect any optical emission, with an upper limit of R = 21.3 (Johnson 
system) estimated from nearby NOMAD1 stars.

Magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction.
The VIRT is still in its commissioning phase.
