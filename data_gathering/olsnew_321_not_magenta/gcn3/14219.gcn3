report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:31:26.02 UT on 15 February 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130215A (trigger 382584689 / 130215063).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (D'Elia et al. 2013, GCN 14204)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single FRED like pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 140 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-7.0 s to T0+124 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak= 155 +/- 63 keV,
alpha = -1.0 +/- 0.2 and beta = -1.60 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.02 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+10.56 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
