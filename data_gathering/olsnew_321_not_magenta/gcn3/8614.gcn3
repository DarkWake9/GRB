FROM:    Diego Gotz at CEA  <diego.gotz@cea.fr>

D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), R. Galis,
V.Beckmann, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at
16:44:55 UT on December 4th. The refined coordinates (J2000)  are:

RA = 349.7735 [degrees]
DEC= -60.2213 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of  
about
0.7 ph/cmq/s (1-s integration time) and a fluence over the same energy
range of about 7x10e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at

to the Subject line.]
