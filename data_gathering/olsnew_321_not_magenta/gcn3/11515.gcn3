of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 110102A, (Swift/BAT trigger=441454:
Oates, et al., GCN 11509; Sakamoto et.al, GCN 11511)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=68074.462s UT (18:54:34.462)

The burst light curve consists of three major pulses,
first two of them are much harder than the third one.
The total duration of the burst is ~160 s.
The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB110102_T68074/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (5.4 ± 0.9)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+76.032s,
of (4.9 ± 0.8)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+164.096 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.22 (-0.16, +0.26),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.3 (< -0.9),
the peak energy Ep = 267(-91, +111) keV,
chi2 = 65/76 dof.

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+73.984 to T0+82.176 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.14 (-0.12, +0.15),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.2 (-3.1, +0.3),
the peak energy Ep = 436(-122, +180) keV,
chi2 = 57/76 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
