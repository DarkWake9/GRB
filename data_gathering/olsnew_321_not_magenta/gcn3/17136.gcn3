The short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 141202A
(IPN triangulation: Golenetskii et al., GCN 17131;
Fermi GBM detection: Roberts, GCN 17133)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=40626.305 s UT (11:17:06.305).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~1.4 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 4.44(-1.02,+1.47)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.624 s,
of 7.37(-2.00,+2.67)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.49(-0.35,+0.47),
and Ep = 538(-150,+274) keV (chi2 = 77/84 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index:
beta < -2.0 (chi2 = 77/83 dof).
