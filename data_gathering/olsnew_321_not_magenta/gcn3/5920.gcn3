 (Leicester) report:


"The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope robotically followed up the Swift
 GRB061210 (trigger #243690, Cannizzo et al) and began observing 
 about 2.4 minutes after the GRB trigger time.

 Observations were affected by the nearby bright moon (~4.3 degrees)
 and no new object was found inside the BAT error circle (Palmer et 
 al., GCN 5905).

 From the acquired set of 3x10 seconds exposures in the R-band we 
 can set an upper limit for the afterglow of R>17.0 at 2.8 minutes 
 (mean time).
