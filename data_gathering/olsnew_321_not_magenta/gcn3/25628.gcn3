We observed 9 sky regions (total: 1350 square degrees with overlaps)
to cover the skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S190828j,
with SVOM/GWAC, at Xinglong Observatory equipped with a set of two
types of wide angle cameras: FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 3.5 cm) and JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera,
aperture = 18 cm). SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and
16 JFOV cameras, working with unfiltered band. The observations are
operated in time-series mode, taking one exposure every 25 seconds
(20s exposure + 5s readout). We estimate a 19.6% prior probability
that the 9 observed and processed regions contain the true location of
the source. The images were taken between ~5.5 hours and ~13 hours after
the event trigger time.

The coordinates of the 9 sky regions and observation times are listed

The weather conditions were hazy during the observations. A 3 sigma 
limiting magnitude of about 16.3 mag in R band was obtained in the single 
frames. No credible new source is detected by our online pipeline during 
follow-up observations. A more detailed image analysis including
co-addition is ongoing with our offline pipeline to search for transient
candidates.
