IceCube detected a candidate cosmic neutrino IceCube-160427A, "AMON ICECUBE HESE 127853 67093193" at 05:52:32.00 UT 
on 16/04/27 (http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/67093193_127853.amon)  The event was a high energy starting event (HESE) 
with track-like characteristics and it arrived when the IceCube detector was in a normal operating state.   
​
More sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to RA=240.57d and DEC=+9.34d (J2000), 
and the position uncertainty reduced to an estimated 0.6 degrees or 36 arcminuntes radius (stat+sys, 90% containment).  We encourage followup 
by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the neutrino.
​
The IceCube neutrino observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic south Pole, Antarctica.
