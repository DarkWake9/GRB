P.A. Price (RSAA, ANU), D.W. Fox (Caltech), A. Piccioni, C. Bartolini, 
I. Bruni, R. Gualandi., A. Guarnieri (Bologna University and Bologna
Astronomical Observatory), G. Pizzichini (IASF-CNR, Sezione di Bologna)
and R. McNaught (RSAA, ANU) report:

We observed the SXC error-circle of GRB 020819 (GCN #1508) with the
Palomar 60-inch telescope at Aug 20.34 UT with 4x600 sec exposures in R.
Comparison of this combined image with those from the SSO 40-inch
telescope (GCN #1506) and the Loiano 1.5-metre telescope (GCN #1509),
both visually and through image subtraction do not reveal any afterglow
candidates.  We estimate the limiting magnitudes to be as follows:

SSO 40-inch		R ~ 20.5 mag	(GCN #1506)
Loiano 1.5-metre	R ~ 21.7 mag	(GCN #1509)
Palomar 60-inch		R ~ 21.5 mag

Comparison of the best NIR afterglow candidate (GCN #1510) with other
sources in the field suggests that this candidate is likely constant in
flux.
