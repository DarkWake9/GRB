Using the data set from T-240 to T+303 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140302A (trigger #589685)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 15901).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 253.862, -12.875 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 55m 26.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -12d 52' 29.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 82%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a sharp rise starting at ~T-0.1 sec,
peaking at ~T+0.2 sec, and a roughly exponential decay with several small
peaks riding on top, finally returning to baseline at ~T+190 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 87.5 +- 11.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.09 to T+106.25 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.09 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.7 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
