D. A. Frail (NRAO), and P. Chandra (RMC) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

"We observed the field of view of GRB 090313 (GCN 8980) with the Very 
Large Array (VLA) in 8.46 GHz frequency on 2009 March 19.23 UT. We 
detect a radio source at position (J2000) RA 13:13:36.189, Dec 
08:05:49.75, which is within 0.3" of the KAIT optical afterglow position 
(GCN 8979). The GRB flux density at 8.46 GHz band is 269+/-31 uJy.
