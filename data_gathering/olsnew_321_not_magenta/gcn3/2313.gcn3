At 06:28:17.45 UTC (23297.45 s UT) on 23 July 2003, the HETE FREGATE, 
WXM, and SXC instruments detected an X-ray flash, designated 
XRF030723 (=H2777), located at high galactic latitude (b = 50 
degrees).

The burst triggered the WXM in the 2-25 keV energy band. The burst 
signal-to-noise was ~9.  A GCN burst alert was issued 42s later, 
reporting a flight-derived WXM localization with a 30 arcmin radius 
(90% confidence). Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a 
localization that was reported in a GCN Notice at 09:47:25 UT. The 
WXM data provided a localization that can be expressed as a 90% 
confidence circle that is 9.4 arcminutes in radius and is centered 
at--

WXM-ground:   RA= +21h 48m 52s,  Dec= -27d 41' 16"  (J2000)

Ground analysis of the SXC data provided an initial localization that 
was disseminated as a GCN Notice at 13:38:19 UT. A refined SXC 
localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 2 
arcmin in radius and is centered at--

SXC-Ground:   RA= +21h 49m 27.4s, Dec= -27d 42' 01"  (J2000)


The burst duration (t90) in the 7-30 keV band was ~23 s. A total of 
1210 counts were detected by Fregate during that interval, 
corresponding to a fluence of ~2 x 10-7 ergs cm-2. The peak flux in a 
1.2 s bin was >3 x 10-8 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie >0.9 x Crab flux) in the 
same energy band.

In the 30-400 keV band, the fluence was < 0.7 x 10-7 ergs cm-2, which 
is  < 0.4 times the fluence in the 7-30 keV band; thus we conclude 
that H2777 is an X-ray flash.
