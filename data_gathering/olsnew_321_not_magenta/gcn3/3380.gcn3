TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB 050509a: Swift XRT Position

J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU), C. P. Hurkett, E. Rol (U. Leicester) 
and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050509a at 01:46:28 UT on 9th May 
2005 (GCN Circ 3379). The observatory executed an automated slew to the 
BAT position and the XRT began taking data at 01:47:22 UT. The XRT was in 
Auto state but was not able to centroid on the afterglow due to low source 
intensity. From downlinked data we find a uncatalogued X-ray source 
located at:

RA(J2000) = 20:42:19.7,
Dec(J2000) = +54:04:16.2

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 13 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3379.
