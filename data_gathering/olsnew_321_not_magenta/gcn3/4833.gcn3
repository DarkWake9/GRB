the REM/ROSS team, report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060218 (Cusumano et al., GCNs 4775, 4781) 
with the  robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla, Chile. 
Observations  were performed on 2006 Feb 25 from 00:16 to 00:30 UT under 
mediocre conditions just after the La Silla sunset with the R and J 
filters. REM is equipped with the REMIR near-infrared camera (10x10 
arcmin^2 FoV, JHK filters) and the ROSS optical spectrograph/imager 
(10x10 arcmin^2 FoV, VRI filters and AMICI prism).

The optical counterpart (Cusumano et al., GCN 4775; Marshall et al., GCN 
4779; Mirabal et al., GCN 4784) was detected in both bands with magnitudes:

R = 17.05 +- 0.17
J = 16.90 +- 0.20

Calibration was based on the SDSS and 2MASS catalogs for the optical and 
near-infrared observations, respectively.
