At 01:42:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB041219 (GCN Circ# 2866, D.Gotz et al.).  The spacecraft
did not autonomously slew to the burst since automated slewing
is not yet enabled.

The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 6.154,+62.847 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 12 arcmin (radius, including a large systematic
uncertainty due to the lack of an on-orbit bore-sight alignment calibration).
This is ~11 degrees off the BAT bore sight and is in the fully encoded
field of view.  This position is consistant with the INTEGRAL position
(GCN Circ# 2866), and is within 4.1 arcmin of the BAT on-board location
(14 sec after the initial rate trigger).  We note that this position
is in the Galactic plane with a Galactic Lon,Lat of 120,+0.1deg.

The burst lightcurve is multi-peaked with structure within the peaks.
After an initial pair of small precursors, the peak intensity increased
to 25 events/cm^2/sec (1-sec sampling; unsaturated; ~15 to 200 keV; 43 Crab)
300 sec after the initial triggering peak.  The total duration was 520 sec.
The fluence is ~1e-4 erg/cm^2.
