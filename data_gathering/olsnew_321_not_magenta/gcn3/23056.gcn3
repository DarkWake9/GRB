and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 180728B was detected by
Fermi (GBM; trigger 554505003), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind,
and Swift (BAT), at about 76199 s UT (21:09:59).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   222.078 (14h 48m 19s) +15.942 (+15d 56' 32")
  Corners:
   221.253 (14h 45m 01s) +11.625 (+11d 37' 29")
   221.537 (14h 46m 09s) +11.383 (+11d 23' 00")
   222.836 (14h 51m 21s) +20.467 (+20d 28' 01")
   222.533 (14h 50m 08s) +20.757 (+20d 45' 26")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2.88 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 9.423 deg (the minimum one is 18.8 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 88 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
