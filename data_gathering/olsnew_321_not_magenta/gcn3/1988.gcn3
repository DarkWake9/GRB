TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1988
SUBJECT: GRB 030329 follow-up
DATE:    03/03/29 14:15:40 GMT

P.A. Price (RSAA, ANU) reports:

Identification of the afterglow of GRB 030329 was performed through
clouds, with thunderstorms surrounding the mountain.  Consequently, it
will not be possible to obtain a spectrum of this bright afterglow from
Australia.  Perth observatory is also experiencing thunderstorms.  We
encourage observations by Northern observatories to track the afterglow
lightcurve.
