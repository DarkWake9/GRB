report:

We observed the field of GRB 050712 (Grupe et al., GCN 3573) in VRI
with the Tautenburg Schmidt telescope starting 21:15 UT on July 12.
The stacked R-band images show a faint source at the position reported
by Rol et al. (GCN 3575). We estimate R>~20 and note, however, that
this source might also be present on the DSS2 red plates. No source
is visible in I, implying I>~19.
