We observed GRB 201015A reported by Swift-BAT (V. D'Elia et al., GCN

GCN 28680) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). The field was observed
in the SDSS r’ filter starting at 2020-10-16T20:21:44.41 UT i.e. ~ 21.5 hrs
after the event detection by Swift-BAT. We obtained 10 exposures of 300 sec
each.

We did not find any source in the stacked image up to r’ > 20.97 mag (5-sigma)
within the uncertainty region, calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data
release (Flewelling et al., 2018).

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
