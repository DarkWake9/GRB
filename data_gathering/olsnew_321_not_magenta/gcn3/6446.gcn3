A. C. Updike, J. R. Puls, and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report 
on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We used the 0.9m SARA telescope at Kitt Peak under decent weather 
conditions to image the field of GRB 070520A (GCN 6423, Romano et al.), 
beginning 17 hours after the burst.  In 40 minutes of stacked exposures, 
we do not detect the object noted by Hattori et al. (GCN 6441) down to a 
limiting magnitude of 20 +/- 0.4 in the R-band.  This magnitude is based 
on calibration to 9 USNO B1.0 stars.
