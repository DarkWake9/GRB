The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1)
data around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate
S191215w (GCN Circular 26441).
Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a
new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN Notice, is
available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S191215w

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 361 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 1770 +/- 455 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
