V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), B.
Sbarufatti (PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester),
P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri
(INAF-OAB) and A.Y. Lien report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 200219A (Lien et al. GCN
Circ. 27125), from 57 s to 13.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 28 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 8 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et
al. (GCN Circ. 27138). We cannot determine at the present time whether
the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00957271.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
