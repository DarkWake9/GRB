Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 071112 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 296504) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 65.0s after the GRB trigger
(10.7s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
from 38 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were fully cloudy until 90 minutes after the GRB.
We co-added a series of exposures taken between 98
and 155 min. We detect the OT reported by Perri et
al. (GCNC 7059) near the limiting magnitude:

t_grb+98 min. to t_grb+155 min. : R = 20.1 +/- 0.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
