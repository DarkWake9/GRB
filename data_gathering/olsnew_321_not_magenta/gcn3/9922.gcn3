Scott Barthelmy and Neil Gehrels,
on behalf of the Swift Team:

The Swift-BAT instrument experienced a partial flight software crash
around ~10:30 UT on 17 Sep 2009.  All the temperatures, voltages, 
currents, etc indicate that the instrument is fine -- only the science
collection portion of the flight software has stopped working.
The fundamental problem has been identified and a fix to the software
is being implemented.  The portion that runs the observing program
continues to run, so the spacecraft continues to point and collect NFI data
on the planned targets.  It will take several days to get the BAT
flight software running again; and during that time there will be no
BAT triggers on new GRBs.
