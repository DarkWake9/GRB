Alessandra Corsi (TTU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position (R.A.,Dec.=128.11, 43.39, J2000) of the Fermi/LAT candidate 
(Omodei et al. LVC GCN #21227) identified in the error region of LIGO/Virgo trigger 
G288732 (LVC GCN #21221) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its C 
configuration. The observations started on 2017 Jun 12 23:08:34 UTC, ended on 2017 
Jun 13 01:08:15 UTC, and were carried out in L-band (nominal central frequency of 
~1.4 GHz). The analysis of the collected data is in progress. Further observations 
are planned.
