We observed the La Silla Quest candidate (GCN 18473; RA = 2.865, DEC = -6.4273), with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio 
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/10 27.11 to 2015/10 27.13 UTC. We obtained a total exposure of 24 minutes on this target.

The source is cleanly detected in the r, i, and z bands.  We find r = 17.14 +/- 0.01, i =  17.37 +/- 0.01, and z = 17.39 +/- 0.06.  These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic 
extinction.
