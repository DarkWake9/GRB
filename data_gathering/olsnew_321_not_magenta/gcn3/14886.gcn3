and J.L. Racusin report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 11 ks of XRT data for GRB 130612A (Racusin  et al. GCN
Circ. 14874),  from 74 s to 30.7 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 233 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Beardmore
et al. (GCN. Circ 14884).

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.96 (+0.09, -0.08).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.19 (+0.28, -0.26). The
best-fitting absorption column is  7.7 (+6.6, -5.5) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 2.006, in addition to the Galactic value of 6.0 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.3 x
10^-11 (4.7 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 6.0 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    7.7 (+6.6, -5.5) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=2.006
Photon index:	     2.19 (+0.28, -0.26)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.96, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.8 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 6.1 x
10^-14 (8.7 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
