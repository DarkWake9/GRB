TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3003
SUBJECT: GRB 050129: a weak long GRB detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/01/31 09:01:13 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), A. Bodaghee, S. Shaw, M. Beck
(ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS
Localization Team report:

A 20 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 20:03:03
UT on Jan. 29. Due to its faintness no automatic IBAS Alert has been
delivered. Its coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  252.7998 [degrees]
DEC:  -3.0788 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.26 ph (3E-08
erg)/cmsq/s, which classifies it among the faintest INTEGRAL GRBs.
