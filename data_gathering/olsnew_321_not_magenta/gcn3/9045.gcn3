J. Kennea (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/XRT Team:

Swift began a TOO observation observation of the LAT error circle of GRB 
090328 (McEnery et al, GCN #9044) at 01:26UT March 29th, 2009. Preliminary 
analysis of the downlinked XRT data finds an uncatalogued X-ray source 
approximately 10 arcminutes from the centre of the LAT error circle, at 
the following location: RA, Dec = 90.66485, -41.88421 which is equivalent 
to:

RA(J2000) =  06h 02m 39.6s
Dec(J2000)= -41d 53m 03.2s

with an estimated uncertainty of 6 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). We 
cannot confirm at this time if the afterglow candidate is fading.
