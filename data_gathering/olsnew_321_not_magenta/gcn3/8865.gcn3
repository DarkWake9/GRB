report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:47:02 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090201 (trigger=341749).  Swift could not immediately slew
due to the Earth limb constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 92.031, -46.586 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 08m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = -46d 35' 10"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multiple-peaked
structure with a duration of about 110 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~10000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~7 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+45.3 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (sro AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
