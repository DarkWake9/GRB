A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (SAI MSU), V. Kouprianov, Ya. Naiden, V. 
Slesarenko, A. Devyatkin (Pulkovo Observatory),   report on behalf of larger 
GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed   the field of the Swift GRB 090621B (Curran et al, GCN  9545) 
with MTM-500 telescope of  Kislovodsk solar station of the Pulkovo 
observatory  in two series in R-filter between (UT) 2009-06-21 22:31 - 
2009-06-22 00:01, i.e. starting ~24 minutes after burst onset.  The upper 
limit of a stacked image of first 15 frames based on USNO B1.0 stars is 
following

T0+         Filter   Exp.      mag.
(mid, d)                 s
0.02147  R        15x60  >18.5 (3 sigma)

While we do not detect  objects reported in GCN 9547 (Levan  et al.) and GCN 
9549 (Galeev et al.) in  the stacked image above, we may suggest a possible 
object near the edge of  the refined XRT error box (Beardmore et al., GCN 
9550) in coordinates (J2000) RA  =  20:53:53.24 Dec = +69:01:45.5. This 
possible object appears more intense in the stacked image of the first five 
frames, and does not appear in the second epoch of our observations started 
on Jun.21 (UT) 23:37. Due to low S/N ratio we cannot confirm the object is 
real. We encourage re-analysis of  later deep observations to clarify the 
nature of the object.

is the USNO B1.0 star 1590-0172172  (RA(J2000)=20:53:57.28, 
Dec(J2000)=+69:01:47.8, R2=19.41)
