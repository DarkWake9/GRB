team: report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.0 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst GRB
140320B (Pagani et al. GCN Circ. 16013), from 12.0 ks to 29.4 ks after
the  INTEGRAL trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 145.5611, +60.2690 which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 09 42 14.66
Dec(J2000): +60 16 08.3

with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 51 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position.  We cannot determine
at the present time whether the source is fading.

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.4 (+0.4, -0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  7.2 (+7.1, -4.8) x 10^20 cm^-2,
consistent with the Galactic value of 2.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et
al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 2.8 x 10^-11 (3.8 x
10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     7.2 (+7.1, -4.8) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.4 (+0.4, -0.3)
