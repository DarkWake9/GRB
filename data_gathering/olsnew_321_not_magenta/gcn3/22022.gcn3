and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171011B (Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 21998;
Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 22005) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 01:05:36.47 on 11 October 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T0 sec
and the brightest pulse peaks at T+1.5 sec.  The entire emission ends at T+3.5 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 2.0 +- 0.3 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
