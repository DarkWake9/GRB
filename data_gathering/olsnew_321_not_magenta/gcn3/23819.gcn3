S.W.K. Emery (UCL-MSSL)
reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 190129B
44980 s after the IPN-detected burst (Hurley et al. GCN Circ. 23808).
No optical afterglow consistent with either the XRT position of the
uncatalogued X-ray source, source 1 (LaPorte et al. GCN Circ. 23813)
or the position of the GROND candidate (Bolmer et al. GCN Circ. 23814)
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
exposures at the position of source 1 are:

Filter      T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag

u             44980         60425         208         > 20.2


The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.10 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
