Y.-D. Hu, T.-R. Sun, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, R. Sanchez-Ramirez and M.D. Caballero-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), D. Hiriart and W. H. Lee (UNAM), C. J. Perez del Pulgar and I. Carrasco (UMA), I. H. Park (SKKU) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-5/JGT robotic telescope at Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir (Mexico) automatically responded in 13 s to the Swift trigger for GRB 210912A (Troja et al., GCNC 30820). In the co-added clear image (30 x 1 s), we find an uncataloged optical source at (J2000) coordinates RA: 8:39:34.30, DEC:+79:13:17.5,  which is located at the edge of the XRT error box (Troja et al., GCNC 30820) and for which we measure R = 18.5 mag. We propose this source to be the GRB 210219A optical afterglow, pending confirmation of its variability. Further observations are ongoing.

We thak the staff at San Pedro Martir for their support.
