Fermi GBM Trigger 140429551 - Detection of a burst from SGR 1806-20

M. Stanbro (UAH) and G. Younes (USRA/MSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi
GBM Team:

"At 13:13:28.49 UT on 29 April 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered on a burst from SGR 1806-20, which was also detected
by Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et. al. 2014, GCN 16183).  The GBM
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The burst consists of a single pulse, with a duration of
T90 = 0.13 +/- 0.02 s. The burst is well-fit with a power law function
with an exponential high-energy cutoff parameterized as Epeak = 25 +/- 2 keV
and an Index -0.3 +/- 0.5. The corresponding peak flux integrated
over 4ms (8-200 keV) is (2.6 +/- 0.5)E-07 erg/s/cm^2. The fluence during
T0-0.032s to T0+0.104s is (1.17 +/- 0.08)E-07 erg/cm^2.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary."
