report:


The field of GRB 030131 was imaged in the R band with the Tautenburg
Schmidt telescope equipped with the prime focus CCD camera on Feb 4,
1:35 - 5:22 UT. The field of view is about 40 x 40 arcmin. Altogether
45 frames were taken (2 min exposure time each). The limiting magnitude of
the combinded image is about R=22.5 +/- 0.5. The GRB field is very rich in
galaxies. Exactly at the position of the potential afterglow
candidate reported by Oksanen et al. (GCN 1849) we do not detect any
source (R>~22.5). Several sources with R>~21 are visible within ~5 arcsec
of the reported OT coordinates.
