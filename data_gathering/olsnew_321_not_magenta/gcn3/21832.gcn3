Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170906C (trigger #770981)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 21826).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 128.659, 70.805 deg, which is
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 34m 38.1s
   Dec(J2000) = +70d 48' 16.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 32%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks starting at
~T-40 sec, peaking at ~T+7 sec, and returning to baseline at ~T+100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 48.4 +- 4.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-35.21 to T+39.22 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.30 +- 0.22,
and Epeak of 104.8 +- 43.0 keV (chi squared 47.9 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+6.18 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
7.2 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.67 +- 0.05 (chi squared 56.9 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
