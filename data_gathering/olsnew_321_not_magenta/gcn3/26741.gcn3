We observed the localization region of the unmodeled gravitational wave trigger S200114f (LVC, GCN #26734) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the 47 square degree Zwicky Transient Facility camera (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019).

The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We started obtaining target-of-opportunity observations in the g-band and r-band beginning at 2020-01-14 03:39 UT, covering 77.7% of the integrated probability based on the cWB skymap (LVC, GCN #26734). Each exposure was 300s, reaching a g-band median depth of 21.9 mag and r-band median depth of 21.6 mag. The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al. 2019).

We queried the ZTF alert stream using the Kowalski infrastructure (Duev et al., 2019). We required at least 2 detections separated by at least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we cross-matched our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known asteroids. We require no spatially coincident ZTF alert to be issued before the detection time of S200114f. The candidates within the 95% probability contour of S200114f that passed the automatic selection criteria and human vetting are presented in the table below.

(d) possible host in Legacy Survey

We caution that the age of these candidates is not well constrained as our triggered ToO observations are deeper than the regular survey. We encourage follow-up.
