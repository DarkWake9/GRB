The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:26:39 UT on 11 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210511B (trigger 642425204.260366 / 210511477).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 316.2, Dec = 61.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 04m, 61d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 49.0 degrees.
