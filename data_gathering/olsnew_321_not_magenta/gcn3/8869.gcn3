Bicocca) report, on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 090201 (Oates et a., GCN 8865) with the 
ESO-VLT in imaging mode starting about 7.5 hours after the burst. 
Observations were carried out in R and I-band with the FORS2 camera.

At the edge of the XRT error circle (Beardmore et al. GCN 8868) we find 
a very faint source at the following coordinates (J2000):

R.A. = 06:08:12.92
Dec. = -46:35:17.3

+/- 0.3"

Preliminary photometry of this candidate afterglow gives R ~ 25.2 and I 
~ 24.1. Further observations are ongoing.


We acknowledge the VLT staff for their support, in particular E. Valenti 
and J. Smoker.
