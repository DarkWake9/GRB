report:

The 30cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malarg√ºe
(Argentina) reacted robotically to the Swift/BAT and
Fermi/GBM alert of GRB190613B (D'Ai et al., GCNC 24807;
Bissaldi et al., GCNC 24814), starting with a series of
20s unfiltered images at 10:47:33.45 UT, i.e. 31.4s
post trigger.

We detect the source reported by Marshall et al. (GCN
24817), Zheng & Filipenko (GCN 24818), Hu et al. (GCNC
24826), de Ugarte Postigo (GCNC 24825) and other teams
at a 5 x 20s combined image taken between 79s and 202s
after the initial trigger. The brightness of the object
was r'(AB) = 15.6 +- 0.2, as calibrated against APASS
Catalogue.
