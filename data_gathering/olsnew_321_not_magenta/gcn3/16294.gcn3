W. Fong and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the location of the short-duration GRB 140516A (Bernardini et
al., GCN 16285) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) mounted on
the Gemini-North 8-meter telescope at a mid-time of 2014 May 17.373 UT
(12.38 hr post-burst). We obtained i-band observations for a total of
1800-sec in 0.5" seeing. We do not detect any optical source within the XRT
position (Osborne et al., GCN 16289). Calibrated to SDSS, we therefore
place a 3-sigma limit of i>26.1 AB mag on the optical afterglow of GRB
140516A at 12.38 hr after the burst.

We thank Gemini observer Lucas Fuhrman for assistance with these
observations."
