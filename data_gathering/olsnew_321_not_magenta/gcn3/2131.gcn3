TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2131
SUBJECT: GRB 030329 and SN 2003dh

R. Chornock, R. J. Foley, A. V. Filippenko, M. Papenkova, and D. Weisz,
University of California, Berkeley, report that inspection of CCD
spectra (range 310-1000 nm) of GRB 030329, obtained on Apr. 8 UT with
the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory, confirms the emergence of
broad bumps (especially at rest-frame 500 nm) characteristic of the
peculiar type-Ic supernovae 1998bw and 2002ap at early times, as announced
by Matheson et al. in GCN 2107 and GCN 2120. The association between 
core-collapse supernovae and at least some of the long-duration GRBs thus
seems solid. We expect the supernova features to continue strengthening
with time relative to the power-law continuum of the GRB afterglow.

P.S.  This information also appears in IAUC 8114, but has been reposted
here for the benefit of those GCN subscribers who do not read the
IAU Circulars.
