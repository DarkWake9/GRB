The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 08:48:05 UT on 15 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200415A (trigger 608633290.563746 / 200415367).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 6.1, Dec = -32.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 24m, -32d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
