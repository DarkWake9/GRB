A. Corsi (GWU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:
 
We imaged the position of GRB 130907A (Page et. al. GCN 15183) 
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in K-band, starting at 
about 4 hours after the burst. A provisional reduction shows a source 
consistent with the location of the GRB optical afterglow reported by 
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 15187). At this time, we estimate a 
preliminary flux of about 1.2 mJy at 24.5 GHz.
 
Further observations are planned.
