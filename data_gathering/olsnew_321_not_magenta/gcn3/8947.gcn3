FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT observed the field of the BAT Slew Survey burst GRB 090306B 
(Copete et al. GCN Circ. 8944) for 5.8 ks, from T0+67 ks to T0+81 ks. The 
data were entirely in PC mode.

A single, faint source is found in the BATSS error circle, with a position 
RA,Dec = 231.2083, -6.9682 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000)  = 15 24 49.99
Dec (J2000) = -06 58 05.6

with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

We currently have only 16 counts from this source, at a count rate of 3.5 
(+/- 0.9) e-3 counts s-1, and are unable to ascertain whether it is 
fading.

Further observations, to verify the nature of this source, are planned.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
