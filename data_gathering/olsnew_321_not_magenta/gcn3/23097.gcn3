(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 180806A (Malacaria et al. GCN Circ.
23095), collecting 1.8 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+57.6 ks and T0+76.2 ks. 

Two uncatalogued X-ray sources are detected, of which one ("Source 1")
is fading with 3-sigma significance, and is therefore likely the GRB
afterglow.  The position of this source is RA, Dec=11.5536, +24.3370
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 00:46:12.86
Dec(J2000): +24:20:13.2

with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). 
This position is 1.3 arcsec from the Fermi/GBM position and 2.7 arcsec
from the OT position reported by Lipunov (GCN 23091) and Watson (GCN
23092).

The source is fading with alpha >2.2.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020812/Source1.php.
The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
