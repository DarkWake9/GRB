Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160220A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 674670) with the TAROT robotic telescopes (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France and
at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla
observatory, Chile.

The observations started 1.64h after the GRB trigger
at Calern and 4.00h after the GRB trigger at la Silla
(the field was not visible at the date of the trigger).
The elevation of the field increased from
20 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures. We do not detected the
X-ray couterpart mentioned by Campana et al. (GCNC 19024):

t1(h) t2(h)  Rmag_lim  Site
1.64 3.30    17.5      TAROT Calern
4.00 4.69    19.0      TAROT La Silla

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
