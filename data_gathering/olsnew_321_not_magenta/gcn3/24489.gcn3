SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S190510g: Update on candidate significance

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:


We have conducted subsequent analysis of data around the time of S190510g

including LIGO and Virgo data collected in the 24 hour period after the

event.  The resulting re-estimate of the background model yields a

FAR (False Alarm Rate) of 1 in 3.6 years compared to 1 in 37 years initially

reported in GCN 24442.


Using the updated background model, the classification of the event,

in order of descending probability, is estimated to be:

Terrestrial (58%), BNS (42%), NSBH (<1%), BBH (<1%), or MassGap (<1%).


Further analysis of the event is ongoing. Updates will be provided

as and when available.
