report on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At the time of the INTEGRAL GRB 130514B (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ# 14638),
Swift was in a preplanned slew maneuver.  BAT photon event data was
collected during this slew.  BAT saves such "slew survey" data when possible
within telemetry constraints.  The source was detected in a mosaic image.
As seen in BAT, the burst was a single FRED peak about 7 +/- 1 seconds long.
The source had about 10% mask coding in the BAT detector plane.

The BAT spectrum is well-fit by a power-law function with a photon index
of 1.72 +/- 0.21.  The fluence from 15-150 keV in 8 seconds was
(8.8 +/- 0.6) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2/sec.  Errors are 68% confidence.
