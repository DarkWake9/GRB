E. Klunko(ISTP), A. Marchenkov (ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI)  on behalf of
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the error box of  GRB071013  (Marshall  et al., GCN 6907) in
R-band on Oct.13 with 1.5m telescope of Sayan observatory. A set of images
of 120 s exposure was obtained starting (UT) 13:20:27. No obvious optical
candidate is found within BAT error circle in the first image (UT) 13:20:27
in comparison with DSS2. Based on USNO A2.0 we estimate limiting magnitude
of the first image as R=19.2.
