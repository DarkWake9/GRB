GRB 040511: Optical Observations

Hsiao-Wen Chen (MIT), Nidia Morrell (Las Campanas Observatory), Joshua S.
Bloom (Harvard/CfA), Jason X. Prochaska (UCO/Lick) report on behalf of the
GRAASP (GRB Afterglows as Probes) Collaboration:

"We have obtained optical images of the field around GRB 040511
(Dullinghan et al., GCN #2588) using the SITe#3 CCD imager and Rc filter
on the 40" Swope telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory.  The camera
has a plate scale of 0.435 arcsec per pixel and covers an 14.7' x 20'
field of view. The observations were carried out starting at 00:15 UT 12
May 2004 (~11 hours after the burst).  Three exposures of 300 sec duration
were taken under photometric conditions.  The 5-sigma depth of the stacked
image is R~23.4 over a 2"-diameter aperture.

A comparison of our stacked image with the DSS/POSS2 red plate shows no
new source to the limit of the plate Rc=20.8."
