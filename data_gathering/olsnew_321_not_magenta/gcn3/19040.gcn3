R. Starling, N. Tanvir, K. Wiersema (U. Leicester) and J. Bailey (UNSW) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160220A (Swift trigger 674670, Lien et al. GCN Circ. 19023; Fermi trigger 477624330/16022005, Hui & Burns GCN Circ. 19026) 
with the 4m Anglo Australian Telescope, AAT, at Siding Spring, Australia on 2016 February 20th, 14 hours after burst.

We obtained near-IR photometry with the Infrared Imager and Spectrograph, IRIS2, in the Ks band beginning at 15:35 UT and in the J band beginning 16:09 UT, 
and totalling 27 minutes exposure in each filter. No source was detected within the Swift XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 19025).
We find the following approximate limiting magnitudes (at 5-sigma in the Vega system):
J > 21 
Ks > 18

We acknowledge excellent support from the Australian Astronomical Observatory staff.
