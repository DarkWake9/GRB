SUBJECT: GRB 170604A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position

FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <klp5@leicester.ac.uk>

K.L. Page, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Using 4539 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 10 UVOT images, we find
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment
and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec =
342.65623, -15.41233 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  22 50 37.49
Dec (J2000): -15 24 44.4

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
