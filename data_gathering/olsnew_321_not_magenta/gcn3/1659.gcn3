GRB 021023: Infrared Imaging

J. S. Bloom and E. Falco (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
report:

"In analysis further to GCN #1657 (Bloom and Falco), we report that no new
sources were detected as compared to 2MASS in the entire IPN error box
given in GCN #1653 (Hurley et al.). The limiting magnitudes for any new
sources in the error box at t_burst + 2.4 days are approximately J= 16.0
mag and K= 15.6 mag."

   Stacked J and K data from 2MASS and STELIRCam are available at:
