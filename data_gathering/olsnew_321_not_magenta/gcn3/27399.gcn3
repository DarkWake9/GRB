The long-duration GRB 200313A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 27374;
Lesage and C. Meegan, GCN Circ. 27383;
BALROG localization: Biltzinger et al., GCN Circ. 27377;
IPN triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 27385)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=6098.088 s UT (01:41:38.088).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
which starts at ~T0-0.4 s and has a total duration of ~43 s.
The emission is seen up to ~6 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.46(-0.14,+0.15)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+2.528 s,
of 3.42(-0.52,+0.53)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+45.824 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 6 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.88(-0.10,+0.12),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.07(-0.17,+0.12),
the peak energy Ep = 442(-66,+77) keV
(chi2 = 70/75 dof).

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+2.048 to T0+3.072 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 6 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.69(-0.13,+0.17),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.24(-0.21,+0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 424(-69,+70) keV
(chi2 = 61/58 dof).
