SUBJECT: GRB 210610B: T-CAT optical observations
DATE:    21/06/25 14:40:15 GMT
FROM:    Denis Marchais at Amateur astronomer  <denis.marchais@free.fr>

I observed the field of GRB 210610B (Page et al., GCN #30170) with the
T-CAT telescope 0.4-meter f/4 Newton with a f/3 reducer, IR-cut filter
at 630nm and ZWO ASI533MC camera, located in Cintegabelle, France, on
June 11, 12 and 13.

The camera has a Sony sensor with Bayer filters R,G,B, that fairly 
match the standard Bc, Vc, and r' filters considering the additional
IR-cut filter. Each observation results from stacking 120x 32s exposures.

The GRB OT is clearly detected in the stacked frames at the following
location, matching other observations (e.g. , Fynho et al. GCN #30182,
Osborne et al. GCN #30186) though approaching the detection limit on
third observation, June 13th.
   RA(J2000)  = 16h 15m 40.39s
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 23' 56.3"

The following magnitudes were obtained thanks to PixInsight photometric 
calibration using nearby APASS DR10 stars.
