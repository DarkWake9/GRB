V. Kumar, D. Bhattacharya and V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:


Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed clear detection of GRB170101B (Fermi-GBM detection: Andreas von Kienlin et al., GCN 20350)
in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows dual peak structure with stronger peak at 02:47:25.870 UT, 8 secs after the Fermi- GBM trigger(consistent with GCN 20350). The measured peak count rate is 209.80 counts/sec above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1751 counts. The local mean background count rate was 377 counts/sec. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 14.3 sec.


CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium
of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated
the project.
