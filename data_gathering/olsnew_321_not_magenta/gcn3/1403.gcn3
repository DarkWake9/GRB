Long, and P. R. Newman, on behalf of the SDSS GRB team, report:

"Visual comparison of one 600 second r'-band image (41.5' x 41.5' field
of view) covering more than 90% of the IPN error box (GCN 1402) for
GRB020531 (=H2042) (GCN 1399), which was taken using the SDSS 0.5-m
"Photometric Telescope" (PT) at APO less than 4.5 hours after the burst
(GCN 1401), and the UK Schmidt second epoch Southern Survey (emulsion
IIaf) plate for this region (taken at 1993.389) shows no new object
brighter than the limiting magnitude of the UK Schmidt plate, which is
R ~ 20.5."
