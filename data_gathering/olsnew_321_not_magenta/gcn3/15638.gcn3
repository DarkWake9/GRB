SUBJECT: GRB 131229A: CARMA 3mm observations

D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 131229A (Page et al., GCN 15627) with
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy between 05:39:00 
and 07:28:46 UT (0.958-1.034 days post-GRB) at a mean frequency of 93 
GHz.  Conditions were excellent during the observation.

A preliminary examination of the observations reveals no source at the 
location of the XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 15631) down to a 
limit of approximately 0.6 mJy.

We thank the CARMA observers B. A. Zauderer and A. Dhabal and the CARMA 
staff for assistance with the observation.
