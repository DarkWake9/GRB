We observed the field of GRB 070628 (Swift trigger 283320; Holland et al., 
GCN 6584) with GROND at the 2.2m Max-Planck Institute telescope at the 
ESO La Silla observatory in Chile. The observations started at 22:21:57, 
about 7.7 hrs after the GRB and just after sunset, and lasted 10 min. 
We observed simultaneously in the g,r,i,z,J,H,K bands. The UVOT afterglow
(Cronwall & Holland, GCN 6585) is clearly detected at H=16.2+-0.3 and 
K=16.3+-0.2 mag. The NIR magnitudes are calibrated against 2MASS. 
Nothing is visible in the J band (limiting magnitude 16.0), and all 
optical frames are saturated due to twilight. 

We note that the afterglow was atypically bright for the given time after
the burst, suggesting a slow fading. We encourage near-IR spectroscopy to
determine the redshift.
