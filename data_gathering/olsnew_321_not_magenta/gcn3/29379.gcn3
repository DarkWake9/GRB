report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, the ground search of GECAM-B data found
a long burst, GRB 210131A, at 2021-01-31T12:29:12.000 UTC (T0).

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 8 keV-4 MeV, this burst
mainly consists of a broad pulse with a duration (T90) of 8.7 +/- 0.4 s.
The 1-s peak counts rate is about 591 cps while the total counts is about
3814 counts.

Although the in-flight calibration of energy response and
localization has not been finalized yet, GECAM-B localized this burst to
the following position (J2000):

Ra: 35.17 deg Dec: 25.23 deg
Err: 7.39 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)

The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
