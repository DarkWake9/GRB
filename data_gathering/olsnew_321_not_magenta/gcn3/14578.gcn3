D. Frederiks, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, reports:

We have found a typo in our GCN Circ. 14575 "Konus-Wind observation of GRB 130505A":
the correct energy range for the K-W energy fluence and peak flux estimations
for GRB 130505A is 20-10000 keV, not  "20 - 1200 keV", as mentioned.
The 20-10000 keV range is a standard for the K-W estimations of GRB energetics
in the observer frame.

We are sorry for the inconvenience.
