report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:52:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070610 (trigger=281993). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 298.795, +26.214  which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 55m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 12' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze. XRT and UVOT will begin observing this target at 21:42UT.
