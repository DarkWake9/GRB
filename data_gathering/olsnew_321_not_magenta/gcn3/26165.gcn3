The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 20:29:39 UT on 4 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191104C (trigger 594592184.818686 / 191104854).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 288.4, Dec = 26.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 13m, 26d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
