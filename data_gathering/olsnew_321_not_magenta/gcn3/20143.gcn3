The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161022A (Stamatikos et al., GCN 20087) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Oct 22.15, Oct 23.26, Oct 
26.22 and Oct 29.31 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Evans et al., GCN 20094), with 3sigma upper limits of 135 uJy, 
93 uJy, 105 uJy and 105 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
