The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:44:57 UT on 15 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190915A (trigger 590219102.911008 / 190915240).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 48.3, Dec = 4.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 13m, 4d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75.0 degrees.
