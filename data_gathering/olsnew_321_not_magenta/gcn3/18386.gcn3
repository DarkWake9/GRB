We observed the field of GRB 151001A (Stamatikos, et al., GCN 18373) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on 
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astron?mico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro M?rtir from 2015/10 2.10 to 2015/10 2.15 UTC (11.31 to 
12.60 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 18376), in comparison with the SDSS DR9 catalog, we obtain the following 
detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

   r   =  22.69 +/- 0.20
   i   =  22.59 +/- 0.20
   z   >  20.03

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB. The source has faded by about 1 
magnitude relative to the earlier observations by the NOT (Kruehler, et al. GCN 18379).
