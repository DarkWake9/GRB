P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Swift-XRT has performed repeat observations of the field of GRB 151122A 
(Palmer et al., GCN Cric. 18637), collecting 4 ks of data from T0+373 ks 
to T0+442 ks.

Both of the X-ray sources reported by Melandri et al (GCN Circ. 18640) 
are still detected, with neither showing evidence of fading. We 
therefore conclude that these are unrelated to the GRB, and XRT did not 
detect the afterglow of GRB 151122A.

The 3-sigma upper limit from the initial observations (3 ks, from 
T0+102.9 ks and T0+114.0 ks) is 5e-3 ct/sec, which corresponds to a 
0.3-10 keV flux of approximately 2e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
