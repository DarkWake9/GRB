The short GRB 180529A (AGILE-MCAL detection: Ursi et al.,
GCN Circ. 22741; IPN triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 22748)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at
08:29:14.435 UTC on 29 May 2018.  The burst signal was seen
by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked pulse which starts
at T+0.06 sec, peaks at T+1.15 sec and ends at T+3.14 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
2.18 +- 0.69 sec and 0.83 +- 0.18 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
There is no any sign of the possible short precursor reported
by Ursi et a. (GCN Circ. 22741) in the CGBM event data which
comprise the time interval from ~T-165 sec to T+507 sec.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
