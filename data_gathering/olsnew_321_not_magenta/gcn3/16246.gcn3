We observed the field of GRB 140508A (Yu, et al., GCN 16224) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/05 10.31 to 2014/05 10.48 UTC (52.29 to
56.42 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.49 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.04 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands and again from 2014/05 11.23 to 2014/05 11.48 UTC (74.56 to 80.45
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.91 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 1.64 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source positionally coincident with the iPTF optical transient
(Singer, et al., GCN 16226), in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we
obtain the following detections:

       t+54.4 hrs           t+77.5 hrs
  r    20.63 +/- 0.03    21.25 +/- 0.05
  i    20.47 +/- 0.03    21.08 +/- 0.05
  Z   20.29 +/- 0.05    21.04 +/- 0.08
  Y   20.24 +/- 0.07    20.76 +/- 0.10
  J   20.17 +/- 0.06    20.79 +/- 0.11
  H   19.92 +/- 0.08    20.58 +/- 0.13

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Including our initial set of
observations (Butler, et al., GCN 16236), the source appears to have faded
as t^(-1.5) in all bands.

Mártir.
