Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130604A (trigger #557354)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 14752).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 250.166, 68.225 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 40m 39.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +68d 13' 28.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 81%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like peak starting at ~T-1 sec,
peaking at ~T+10 sec, and ending at ~T+90 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 37.7 +- 4.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.44 to T+43.58 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.51 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+14.39 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
