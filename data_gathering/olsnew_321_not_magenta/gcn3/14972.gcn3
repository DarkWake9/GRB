report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:05:23.08 UT on 2 July 2013, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 130702A (trigger 394416326 /
130702.004). The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM 
trigger data, is RA = 218.8, Dec = +12.25 (J2000 degrees, equivalent
to J2000 14h 35m, +12d 15'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0
degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is
additionally a systematic error which is currently estimated to be
2 to 3 degrees).  The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75
degrees.

The GBM trigger is possibly associated with an optical transient
reported by Singer et al. (GCN 14697) and Guidorzi et al. (GCN 14698).
This event was also detected above 100 MeV by the Fermi LAT 
(Cheung et al., GCN 14971).

The GBM light curve shows a FRED-like burst with a duration (T90)
of about 59 s (50-300 keV). The burst has a 1.024-s peak flux of
7.03 +/- 0.86 ph/s-cm^2. The time-averaged spectrum from 
T0+0.003 to T0+16.384 s is well fit by power-law function with 
alpha = -1.65 +/- 0.02. The fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time 
interval is (6.3 +/- 2.0)E-06 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
