K. D. Alexander (Harvard), T. Laskar (NRAO / UC Berkeley), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 160127A (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 18938) at multiple
frequencies with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning 2016
January 28.46 UT (1.09 days after the burst). At a mean frequency of 21.8
GHz, we detect a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~70 uJy at

RA = 15:03:55.773 +/- 0.013
Dec = +00:04:22.07 +/- 0.17

consistent with the enhanced Swift/XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 18940)
and the optical position (Cucchiara et al., GCN 18941; Siegel &
Amaral-Rogers, GCN 18945). Follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
