Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, I. Perez-Garcia, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift/BAT trigger of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCNC 28632), the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, automatically responded to this burst. A series of images were taken starting on 15 Oct at 22:50:48UT (35 s after trigger). We confirm the OT reported by MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCNC 28633) in our co-added 30x1s clear filter images at a similar epoch (T_mid = 205 s) with 17.0 mag, at a position consistent with the reported Swift/XRT X-ray (Kennea et al., GCNC 28635) and late-time optical afterglows position reported by NOT (Malesani et al., GCNC 28637) and GOTO (Ackley et al., GCNC 28639). Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA for their excellent support.
