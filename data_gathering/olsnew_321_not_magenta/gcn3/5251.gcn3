K. L. Page, A. P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and J. A. Kennea (PSU) report 
on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

We have analysed 37.8 ks of XRT data obtained for the field of GRB 060602A 
(Schady et al.; GCN 5196), starting 1.8 days after the trigger, when the 
burst was no longer Moon constrained.

A faint source was found within the BAT error circle, at a position of

RA(J2000)  =  09 58 16.80
Dec(J2000) = +00 18 14.8

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.2 arcsec (90% containment). This source 
is fading with an approximate slope of alpha = 1.10, so is very likely the 
X-ray afterglow.

This source is 2.3 arcsec from the possible counterpart identified by 
Jensen et al. (GCN 5203).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
