Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141005A (trigger #614415)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 16882).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 291.103, 36.098 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 24m 24.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 05' 54.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 6%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-1 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+7 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 4.34 +- 1.08 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.19 to T+5.66 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.33 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.2 +- 0.8 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
