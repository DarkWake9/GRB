P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino (INAF, OABr), G.L. Israel, S. Piranomonte (INAF, 
OARm), D. Malesani (SISSA/ISAS), G. Tagliaferri (INAF, OABr), G. 
Chincarini (Univ Milano-Bicocca), L. Stella (INAF, OARm), report:

The field of GRB 050714B (Levan et al., GCN 2613; Tueller et al., GCN 
3615) was observed again with the ESO VLT-UT2. Ten exposures lasting 180 
s were acquired with the FORS1 instrument (mean time 2005 Jul 17.97, 
that is 3.03 days after the GRB). These images go deeper than our 
previous dataset (Covino et al., GCN 3616).

In addition to sources 1 and B reported by Covino et al. (GCN 3616), we 
find two more fainter sources lying at the edge of the XRT error circle 
(Levan et al., GCN 3614; Page et al., GCN 3618):

  C: alpha = 11:18:48.24,  delta = -15:32:54.3 (J2000);
  D: alpha = 11:18:48.40,  delta = -15:32:53.3 (J2000).

An updated finding chart is posted at the following URL:

When compared to our previous images, sources 1 and B do not show 
variability within the photometric errors. Source B is coincident with 
the UVOT object (Gronwall et al., GCN 3620) and is extended also in our 
images.

At the present stage, therefore, no object can be easily singled out as 
the GRB afterglow, although source B could be the GRB host galaxy.

We thank the ESO staff for excellently performing these observations in 
service mode.
