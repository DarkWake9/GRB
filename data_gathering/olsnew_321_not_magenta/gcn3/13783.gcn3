B.-B. Zhang (PSU), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC), Dirk Grupe (PSU) and B. N. 
Barlow (PSU) report:

We have analyzed the full XRT data set for Swift trigger 534017 (Barlow et al,
GCN 13780).  There are only 192s of XRT data available. We find no sources in
the XRT field; the XRT data cover 100% of the BAT error circle. We thus
conclude that trigger 534017 was not an astrophysical event.
 
This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
