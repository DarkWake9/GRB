The La Silla-QUEST survey operating the 10-sq-deg QUEST camera on the 1.0m ESO
Schmidt at La Silla, Chile covered the following ~40 sq. deg area overlapping
the southern portion of the  ~90% confidence area of LVC event G184098 :

RA 92.043 to 115.39 deg; Dec -71.053 to -66.261 deg

3 transients were detected with high confidence:

LSQ Desig   V-mag    hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss
______________________________________________
LSQ15bbj     19.8    07:16:14.45  -69:36:00.36
LSQ15bbc     19.5    07:06:16.63  -67:12:12.24
LSQ15bbb     17.4    07:25:16.51  -69:04:01.20

LSQ15bbb appears to be a supernova 3.1" north-east of 2MASS galaxy
J07251616-6904038 at z = 0.037
LSQ15bbc is a likely variable star, with positions appearing in USNO, WISE,
and GALEX catalogs
LSQ15bbj appears to be a supernova ~3" north of the core of an uncatalogued
galaxy

The QUEST survey will continue to take nightly  observations of the target
area described above.
