"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060115 (GCN 4509) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 13:36:56 UT on Jan.15.
After co-adding a set of 30 images (13:36:56 - 14:28:26 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 18.1 mag."
