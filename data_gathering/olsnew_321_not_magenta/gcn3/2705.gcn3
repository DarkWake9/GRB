M. Isogai(Tokyo Univ.) and  Y. Urata(RIKEN) report:

" We have imaged the entire HETE-2 error circle (Butler et al.,
GCN 2701) using Kiso 1.05 m Schmidt telescope with 2kx2k CCD camera
starting at 2004 Sep 12.668 UTC. We obtained 3 x 300 sec R-band
images.  Each R-band image gives limiting magnitude of R~20 mag. using
R magnitudes of near USNO_A2.0 stars as photometric references.  We
found a source around "23:57:10 -00:56:42" (R~19.4 mag.) which is not
in DSS II images. But, comparing our second image with our third one,
it seem to move about 4 arcsec in 5 minute. It may be minor
planet. Because of our network trouble we cannot access "MINOR PLANET
CHECKER" page now."
