K. D. Alexander (Northwestern), T. Laskar (University of Bath), C.
Kilpatrick (Northwestern), G. Schroeder (Northwestern), W. Fong
(Northwestern), E. Berger (Harvard), R. Margutti (Northwestern), C. G.
Mundell (University of Bath), and P. Schady (University of Bath) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 210610B (Page et al. GCN 30170) at a mean frequency of 14.7
GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA; Program 21A-241)
beginning 2021 June 11.22 UT (9.4 hours after the burst). We detect a radio
source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.25 mJy at:

RA (J2000) = 16:15:40.381
Dec (J2000) = +14:23:56.59

with an uncertainty of 0.07 arcsec in each coordinate. This position is
fully consistent with the optical afterglow (Page et al. GCN 30170; Kumar
et al. GCN 30174) and the refined Swift/XRT afterglow position (Osborne et
al. GCN 30189). Additional follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly approving and executing these
observations.
