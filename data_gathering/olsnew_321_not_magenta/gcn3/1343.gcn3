 Univ.)  on behalf of the RIBOTS/RIMOTS team
 
  We have observed covering the entire error circle of GRB020124
 (Ricker et al. GCN 1220) field with the RIBOTS/RIMOTS 30-cm
 telescopes.  The observations started at an early epoch (+1.3 hours
 after the burst).  All the images were taken with 15 sec exposure and
 stacked for deeper inspection.
 
  From a comparison with the DSS-2 images we did not identify any new
 point source for the GRB.  We summarize the observing time and the
 R-band limiting magnitude (SN=3), which was estimated by the
 comparison of our non-filter data with the R band field photometry by
 Henden (GCN 1251).
