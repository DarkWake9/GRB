report:

We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 041006 (GCN #2765) with
the Gemini North Telescope + GMOS at 2004 Oct 7.36 UT.  Observations
consisted of 4 integrations of 1800 sec with the R400 grating and a 1
arcsec slit.  Inspection of a single frame reveals absorption lines at
6750A and 6810A, which we interpret as corresponding to the Ca II H and
K lines at a mean redshift of z = 0.716, in broad agreement with the
redshift of z = 0.712 proposed by Fugazza et al. (GCN #2782).

We thank the staff of Gemini North for performing these observations.
