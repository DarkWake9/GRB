Tohuvavohu (PSU) and A.Y. Lien report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 190103B (Lien et al. GCN
Circ. 23602), from 99 s to 18.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 437 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 23603).

The late-time light curve (from T0+4.2 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.03 (+/-0.10).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.38 (+/-0.06). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.27 (+0.28, -0.27) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.89 (+/-0.11) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 3.9 (+0.6, -0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 4.1 x 10^-11 (6.0 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.9 (+0.6, -0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 11.8 sigma
Photon index:	     1.89 (+/-0.11)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.03, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.027 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.1 x
10^-12 (1.6 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
