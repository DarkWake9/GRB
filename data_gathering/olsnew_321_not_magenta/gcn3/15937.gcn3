We observed the field of GRB 140304A (Evans, et al., GCN 15915) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/03 6.12 to 2014/03 6.14 UTC (37.55 to
38.08 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.15 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS
DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detection and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 22.77
  i     > 22.60
  Z     20.88 +/- 0.20
  Y     > 20.96
  J     > 20.65
  H     > 20.31

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  In the Z-band, the source has
faded as a powerlaw t^(-1.3) relative to our observations conducted last
night (Butler et al., GCN 15928).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
