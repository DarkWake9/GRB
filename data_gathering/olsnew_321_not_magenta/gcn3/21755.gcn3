We observed MASTER OTJ033744.97+723159.0, originally reported in GCN #21720, on 2017-08-29 at 04:05UT using the SPRAT spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope. We concur with the classification reported in GCN #21737: using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) with the redshift of NGC1343 we believe this transient to be a supernova Type IIb at 2 days before maximum.

We also observed the field of the optical transient discovered with Swift/UVOT (GCN #21733) in ugriz with the IO:O imager on the Liverpool Telescope, starting at 03:31UT on 2017-08-29. We do not detect an object at these coordinates, as has already been reported by a number of different groups. Our magnitude limits are comparable to those obtained with the Asiago 1.82 m Copernico Telescope (GCN #21745).
