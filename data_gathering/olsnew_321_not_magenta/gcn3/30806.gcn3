report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:45:46.94 UT on 10 September 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located a bright, SGR-like flare from the direction of
the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (trigger 652927551/210910032).

The flare was also observed by Konus Wind (Ridnaia et al., GCN 30804) and
triangulated to an annulus incorporating the SGR position by the IPN (Ridnaia et al., GCN 30803).
The on-ground calculated location using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent
with the known position of the SGR and the IPN localization.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 102 degrees.

The burst has a duration (T90) of about 1.4 s (10-1000 keV).

It is best fit by a double-blackbody model with temperatures of
kT1 = 8.51 +/- 0.08 keV and kT2 = 16.55 +/- 0.18 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) from T0-0.064s to T0+1.328s is
(3.858 +/- 0.011)E-05 erg/cm^2. The average photon flux in the
10-1000 keV band during this period is 522.7 +/- 1.5 ph/s/cm^2.

Fermi GBM has also triggered on 14 other bursts from the direction of SGR 1935+2154 over
the last 4 days, indicating it has entered a stage of heightened activity in this latest outburst:
