P.A. Price, B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) and T.S. Axelrod (Arizona) report:

We have re-observed the error box of GRB 020418 (GCN #1376) with the
robotic MSO 50-inch telescope + MACHO imager at 2002 Apr 20.41 UT to
search for variable sources that might be the afterglow.  On PSF-matched
image subtraction from our first epoch image (GCN #1377), we do not find
any afterglow candidate to the limiting magnitude of our first epoch
images (R ~ 21.2 mag).
