H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA) for the Swift team:

Further analysis of the BAT and XRT event data for Swift trigger 552142 (Krimm
et al, GCN 14345) shows that this event was a low-significance image trigger on 
noise.  The analysis of 1.8 ks of XRT data did not reveal X-ray sources
in the field down to a flux limit of 3 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the
0.3-10 keV band.  Therefore this event is not a GRB or other astrophysical event.
