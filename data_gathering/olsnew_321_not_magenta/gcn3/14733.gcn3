SUBJECT: GRB 130603A: Swift-XRT observations

D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), M. Perri (ASDC), G. Tagliaferri

report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 130603A at 06:51:16.2 UT,
3103.6 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 86.89380, 82.90992
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 05h 47m 34.51s
   Dec(J2000) = +82d 54' 35.7"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 90 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (5.28 x
10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 4.9
(+2.95/-2.45) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
