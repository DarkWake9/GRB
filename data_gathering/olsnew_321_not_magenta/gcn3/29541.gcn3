Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR), Varun Bhalerao (IIT-B), Kuntal Misra (ARIES) 
and G. C. Anupama (IIA) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We carried out radio observations of GRB 210204A (GCN#29390)  with the 
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in uGMRT band 5 
(1000-1450 MHz). The observations were taken on 2021 Feb 20 and the 
preliminary flux at at a position RA, Dec(J2000) 07:48:19.345, 11:24:33.91 
is ~140 uJy. The uncertainty in the measurements is ~20 uJy.

Further observations are planned. We thank GMRT staff for making these
observations possible.
