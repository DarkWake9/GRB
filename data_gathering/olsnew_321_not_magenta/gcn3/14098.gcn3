S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), S. T. Holland (STScI)
and C. J. Mountford (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:44:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR 1E 1841-045 / Kes 73  (trigger=543763).  Swift did not slew
because of the Sun observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
   RA, Dec 280.334, -4.902, which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 41m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = -04d 54' 08"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The real-time lightcurve packets were corrupted
so nothing is known about the shape of the light curve, but presumably
it is a single spike (typical of this source); and the trigger duration
was 16 msec. 

The source will remain in Sun constraint until Feb 13.  There will be no
further observations by Swift.
