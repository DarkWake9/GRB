J. A. Kennea (PSU), O. Godet (U. Leicester), D. N. Burrows (PSU) and N. 
Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Swift began a target of opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL detected 
burst GRB 060130 (GCN 4615) at 15:18:04 UT January 30th 2006, 10.3 hours 
after the burst. We have analyzed 10ks of Swift/XRT data of the field of 
the INTEGRAL burst and detect no source in or near the 2 arcmin INTEGRAL 
error circle. Assuming a Crab like spectrum and galactic absorption, we 
calculate a 3 sigma upper limit on the flux of the afterglow of 5 x 10^-14 
erg/s/cm^2 (0.2-10 keV).
