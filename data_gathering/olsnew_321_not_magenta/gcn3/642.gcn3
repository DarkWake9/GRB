K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline and E.
Mazets, on behalf of the NEAR and KONUS-Wind teams, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS observed GRB000418 at 35590 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, this burst had a duration of ~30 s,
and a 25-100 keV fluence of ~1.3x10^-5 erg/cm^2.  We have
triangulated it to an ~ 35 sq. arcmin. error box at the 
following 3 sigma, preliminary position:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 12 h 25 m 21.17 s     20 o  5 '   3.61 "  (CENTER)
 12 h 25 m 33.03 s     20 o  4 '  17.15 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 24 m 49.69 s     20 o 13 '  17.39 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 25 m 52.50 s     19 o 56 '  49.93 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 25 m  9.30 s     20 o  5 '  50.00 "  (CORNER)

This position can be refined.
