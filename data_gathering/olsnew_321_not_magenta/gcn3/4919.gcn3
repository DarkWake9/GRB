TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4919
SUBJECT: GRB 060322: Swift XRT afterglow candidate
DATE:    06/03/25 01:26:52 GMT

M. Perri, L. Vetere (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing the field of GRB 060322 (trigger #202442,
Perri et al., GCN 4903) at 2006-03-24 11:36:11 UT, approximately 37
hours (1.5 days) after the BAT trigger. In a first XRT exposure of ~9 ks
we detect a faint uncatalogued X-ray source at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 18h 16m 56.4s
Dec(J2000) = -36d 42' 31"

with an estimated uncertainty of 5 arcseconds (90% containment).
This position lies 45 arcseconds from the BAT refined position reported
by Palmer et al. (GCN 4907).

Due to the small number of counts, we are unable to determine whether
the source is decaying at this time. Observations are continuing and
further analysis regarding the fading nature of this source will be
issued as the data becomes available.
