D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:47:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061126 (trigger=240766).  Swift did not slew immediately
to the burst location because of the Earth limb observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 86.625, +64.190
{05h 46m 30s, +64d 11' 24"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).  The BAT
light curve shows four somewhat overlapping peaks starting at ~T-5 sec
and ending at ~T+35 sec (duration ~40 sec).  The peak count rate
was ~21000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

XRT and UVOT observations will begin when the GRB comes out of 
Earth-limb constraint, at T+23 minutes.
