The long GRB 200303A (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: Fermi GBM
Team, GCN Circ. 27294; Swift detection: Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 27297;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200303A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:34:20.728 UTC
on 3 March 2020. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at
T+2.3 sec, peaks at T+39.4 sec, and ends at T+88.8 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 68.9 +- 12.8 sec
and 28.9 +- 3.3 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
