The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) observed the field of the 
X-ray flash GRB050215B (GCN 3024) between February 25, 2005 and February 
28, 2005 UT.  The 5-sigma limiting magnitudes for each exposure are 
presented below.  We stress that the limiting magnitudes are based on 
ground calibrations and are uncertain by approximately +/-0.5 mag.

We find no evidence for a brightening source, such as a supernova 
component, at the location of the afterglow seen by UKIRT (GCN 3031).
