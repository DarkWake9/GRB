We have imaged the BeppoSAX revised error-box of GRB000615 (GCN 705) 
using the AZT-24 1.1-meter telescope at Campo Imperatore (AQ). We 
observed for a total exposure time of 3600 sec in J-band and 1500 sec 
in K-band. Observations started at June 15.9792 UT about 17.2 hours 
after BeppoSAX trigger time (GCN 703) and ended at 16.09167 UT. We 
imaged the field in J-band twice with a time interval of about 2 hours.  
The limiting magnitude in the combined images is J=20.5 mag and K=17.5 mag
(S/N=3) with an average seeing of 2.5" . A preliminary comparison of the 
first 900 sec with the last 1500 sec J-band images reveals no obvious fading 
objects. The comparison of the combined 3600 sec J-band images with the 
POSS-II red plate and the FLWO field (GCN 706), reveals no obvious new 
objects. 

Further observations of this field are planned at Campo Imperatore.
