of a larger GRB collaboration :

The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), India observed the field of
XRF 080109/SN2008D (GCN 7159, GCN 7178) on 11 Feb. 2008 (between 14.0 UT
and 19.0 UT) at 1280 MHz using a bandwidth of 32 MHz. The radio transient
was not detected down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 165 microJy at the
source location.

We thank GMRT and the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) staff.
This TOO was done under the GMRT Director's Discretionary Time.
GMRT is run by NCRA-TIFR, Pune (INDIA).
