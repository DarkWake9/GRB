TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 191019A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    19/10/19 16:22:58 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows
(PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S. Campana (INAF-OAB) and G. Cusumano
(INAF-IASF PA) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 191019A at 16:06:04.5 UT,
3210.9 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
340.0244, -17.3286 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 22h 40m 05.86s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 19' 42.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 49 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (3.28 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.5
(+2.44/-3.29) x 10^22 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
