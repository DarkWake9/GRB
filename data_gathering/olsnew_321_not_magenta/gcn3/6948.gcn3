B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), T.A. McKay (U Mich), F. Yuan (U Mich), 
report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 
071020A (Swift trigger 294835). The first image was at 07:02:52.5 UT, 25.6 
s after the burst (9.5 s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images 
are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 13.6 magnitude, fading 
source with coordinates:

     07:58:39.9      +32:51:41.4    (J2000), with positional uncertainty 
of 1" or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker 
database.
