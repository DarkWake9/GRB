A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 03:47:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200901A (trigger=994143).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 61.758, -59.880 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 07m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 52' 47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+47.5
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

This source lies within the current (Sector 29) field-of-view of TESS camera 3. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. K. Simpson (kira.simpson1984 AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
