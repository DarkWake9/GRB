"We observed the Optical Transient candidate of GRB 010222 reported 
by Handen, GCN #961 and McDowell et al., GCN #963 in J and K band 
with the AZT-24 1.1-meter telescope at Campo Imperatore (AQ).

The J-band observation started at February 23.0078 UT and the field
was imaged for a total exposure time of 2200 sec. A point-like source
was observed in a position consistent with the OT position (GCN #961,
#963). The source was detected with a S/N=10 and had a magnitude of
J=18.7+/-0.1. Another J-band observation started at February 23.1674 
and the field was imaged for a total exposure time of 2200 sec. The 
source was still detected at a S/N=5 and had a magnitude of J=19.3+/-0.2

The K-band observation started at Feb. 23.0681 UT and the field was
imaged for a total exposure time of 2700 sec. The source was detected 
with a S/N=8 and had a magnitude of K=17.4+/-0.3.
