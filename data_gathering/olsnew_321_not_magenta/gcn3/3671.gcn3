report:

We observed the error box of GRB 050724 (Covino et al., GCN 3665) with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey). We made a set of 600s exposures in R, starting at
18:11 UT, July 24, i.e. approximately 5.6 hours after the burst.
Observations were made at very high zenith distance (65-75 degrees) and
in poor seeing conditions (~2 arcsec).

We found no variable sources brighter than our limiting magnitude, which
is only slightly deeper than DSS.
