Swift Team:

At 09:07:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060717 (trigger=219646).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 170.862, +28.948 {11h 23m 27s, +28d 56' 54"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak 
about 5 sec in duration with a peak count rate of 1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV). 

The XRT began taking data at 09:11:15 UT, 216 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in the
image, however analysis of TDRSS downlinked PC data reveals a faint point 
source at the following coordinates

   RA(J2000) =  11h 23m 21.9s
   Dec(J2000)= +28d 57' 05.4"

with an estimated uncertainty of 9 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position lies 66 arcseconds from BAT localization. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 73 seconds with the
White (160-650 nm) filter starting 221 seconds after the BAT trigger. 
No afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. 
Image catalog data are not available at this time. The 8'x8' region
for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18
mag. No correction has been made for extinction.
