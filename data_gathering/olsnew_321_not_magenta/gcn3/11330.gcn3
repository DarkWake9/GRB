report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 16:43:15.61 UT on 08 Oct. 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101008A (trigger 308248997 / 101008697).

The burst was also detected by the SWIFT-BAT
(W. H. Baumgartner et al. 2010, GCN 11318)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a fast rise - slow decay peak
with a duration (T90) of about 7 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.536 s to T0+5.376 s is 
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.42 +/- 0.03
(C-stat 1249.1 for 612 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) over the above time interval is 
(2.016 +/- 0.083)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+1.344 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 4.90 +/- 0.84 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
