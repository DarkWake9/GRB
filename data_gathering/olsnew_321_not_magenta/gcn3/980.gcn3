Teramo, Italy, report:

We carried out R-band observations of the GRB010222 field at the 0.72 m 
telescope of the Osservatorio Astronomico di Teramo, starting on Feb 
23.083 UT and ending on Feb 23.156 UT, with a total integration time of 
75 min. Preliminary data reduction shows a faint object at the location 
indicated by Stanek et al. (GCN 970). Using their star "A" as a 
comparison star, we found R=19.20 p/m 0.06 on our coadded unflattened 
image. Further reduction is under way.
