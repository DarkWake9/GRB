At 12:43:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060614 (trigger=214805).  Swift slewed immediately to 
the burst.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 320.862, -53.034 {21h 23m 27s, -53d 02' 02"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 120 sec, with initial bright sharp
peak and a long, also bright, somewhat softer extended peak.  The peak 
count rate was ~10000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the 
trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:45:19 UT, 91 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a very bright, fading and uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) = 21h 23m 32.3s, Dec(J2000) = -53d 01' 32.1", with an
estimated uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). 
This location is 58 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within
the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 0.1s image was
6.0e-08 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 102 seconds after the BAT trigger. There
is a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image
at (RA,DEC) (J2000) of (320.8839,-53.0267) or
(21h23m32.14s,-53o01'36.1")  with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5
arc sec. This position is 4.3 arc sec. from the center of the XRT
error circle. The estimated magnitude is 18.4 with a 1-sigma error of
about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of  0.02.
