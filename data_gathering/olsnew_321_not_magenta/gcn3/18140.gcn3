Harvey Moseley (GSFC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 150811A (Evans, et al., GCN 18119) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio AstronÃ³mico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro MÃ¡rtir from 2015/08 13.14 to 2015/08 13.40 UTC (47.37 to
53.59 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.93 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We continue to detect the optical afterglow.  Relative to the flux reported
in Butler et al. (GCN 18132), the source continues to appear to fade
approximately as t^(-1).  In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS
catalogs, we obtain the following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r = 22.00 +/- 0.20
  i = 21.83 +/- 0.20
  z > 20.40

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
