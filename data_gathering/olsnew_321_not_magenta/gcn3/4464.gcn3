K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 The error region of GRB 060110 (Zane et al. GCN 4463) was observed by
a 0.3 m telescope in the New Mexico Skies Observatory. Starting at
08:03:39 UT (142 s after the burst), several 120 s exposures in Ic and
Rc bands were obtained.

 Preliminary analysis of the two Ic frames does not reveal an
afterglow candidate brighter than about 16 mag (USNO B1.0 I mag)
within the BAT error region.
