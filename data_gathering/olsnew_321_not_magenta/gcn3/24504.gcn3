The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events consistent with the sky localization of S190512at-2-Initial in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-05-12 17:58:54.000 UTC to 2019-05-12 18:15:34.000 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. No track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the 90% spatial containment of S190512at calculated from the map circulated in the preliminary notice. 

IceCube's sensitivity to point sources within the location spanned by the 90% spatial containment of S190512at ranges from 0.029 to 0.568 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
