report:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 200524A (F. F. Dirirsa et al., GCN
27797, Evans et al., GCN 27798) with the 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical
Telescope (DFOT) at Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences
(ARIES), Nainital (India), from 2020-05-24T19:50:12 UTC (corresponding to
~14.770 hours after
the burst).

We observed 5 frames each of 300 seconds in Bessell I filter. In the
stacked image, we clearly detected the optical afterglow of GRB 200524A
(detected by Ho et al., GCN 27799, see also Kumar et al., GCN 27800,
Rumyantsev et al., GCN 27802 and Sanwal et al., GCN 27803).


The observed magnitude is as follows:
