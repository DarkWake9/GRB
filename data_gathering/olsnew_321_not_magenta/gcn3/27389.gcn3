IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches [1,2] for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate
S200316bj
 in a time range of 1000 seconds [3] centered on the alert event time
(2020-03-16 21:49:36.157 UTC to 2020-03-16 22:06:16.157 UTC) have been
performed.

During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No significant track-like events are found in spatial coincidence of
S200316bj calculated from the map circulated in the 3-Initial notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment
of S200316bj ranges from 0.029 to 1.067 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
