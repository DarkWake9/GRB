K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline, on behalf
of the KONUS-WIND and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, KONUS-WIND, and NEAR observed a gamma-ray burst on May
27 1998 at 50269 s UT.  The 25-100 keV fluence was  
~8 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and the burst duration was ~20 s.
Triangulation gives an error box with an area of ~100 arcmin^2,
whose corners are at:

RA(2000)		DEC(2000)
22 h 50 m 23 s     -20 o 58 ' 03 "         
22 h 51 m 15 s     -20 o 49 ' 50 "    
22 h 49 m 38 s     -20 o 57 ' 01 " 
22 h 50 m 30 s     -20 o 48 ' 51 "

This error box can be refined with further processing.
