TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1851
SUBJECT: GRB030131: Kiso optical limit for corrected position 
DATE:    03/02/04 06:50:45 GMT
FROM:    Yuji Urata at RIKEN  <urata@crab.riken.go.jp>

T. Soyano, H. Mito and  Y. Urata on behalf of the Kiso GRB team,
M. Ishiguro (ISAS) : 

"We have observed the entire corrected localization region of
GRB030131(Mereghetti et al., GCN 1847) with Kiso observatory 1.05 m
Schmidt telescope.  We obtained two R-band data sets (300 sec x 3
frames), starting at 15:36 UT and 18:45 UT. Our limiting magnitude
estimated from USNO-A2.0 stars is R~20. Comparison with DSS II red
images, no new object was detected down to the limiting magnitude.

 We also could not identify the candidate of Okasanen (GCN 1849)
at first and second epoch."
