Klotz A., Noysena.K., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Eymar, L. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UWA - Univ. Western Australia) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 180510B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 831816) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 2.88h after the GRB trigger
just after the dusk. The elevation of the field
decreased from 38 degrees above horizon weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures but we we cannot
detect the OT reported by Tohuvavohu et al. (GCNC 22696)
Preliminary analysis gives:

start  end    rlim(AB)
(hour) (hour)
2.88   3.62   19.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
