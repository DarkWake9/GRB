E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, 
report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and MO-HEND observed this burst at 69663 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  10
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.3E-05 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate preliminary 3 sigma error boxes whose
approximate areas are 140 sq. arcmin. each and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  13 h 50 m 12.66 s     61 o 50 '  43.79 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 13 h 50 m 25.94 s     62 o 13 '  54.09 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 13 h 50 m 25.32 s     61 o 29 '  58.72 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 13 h 49 m 57.94 s     62 o 10 '  25.39 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 13 h 49 m 57.26 s     61 o 25 '  42.46 " 

OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  13 h 44 m 44.28 s      54 o 40 ' 41.39 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 13 h 44 m 23.07 s      54 o 17 '  40.27 "  
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 13 h 45 m 23.41 s      55 o 00 '  43.10 "   
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 13 h 44 m 05.82 s      54 o 21 '  43.49 "  
 ERROR BOX CORNER 8: 13 h 45 m 06.47 s      55 o 05 '  34.50 " 

These error boxes may be improved considerably, and we are seeking
auxiliary data which may allow us to distinguish between these two
possibilities.  Maps will be posted shortly at
sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020715.
