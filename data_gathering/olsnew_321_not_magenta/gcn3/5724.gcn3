 on behalf of the Suzaku WAM team report:

 The bright, long burst, GRB 061007 (Schady et al., GCN 5707; Markwardt 
 et al., GCN 5713),  triggered the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM), 
 which covers the energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV, at 10:08:05.627 (UT).
 Three large peaks as well as a following smaller peak (GCN 5713) were 
 clearly seen in the WAM light curve. The T90 duration was about 59 seconds.
 The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.38x10-4 erg/cm2, while the 1-s peak 
 flux was 14.3 (-1.0,+0.3) photons/cm2/s in the same energy range.

 Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum is 
 well-described with a GRB Band model as follows.

  the low-energy photon index alpha: -0.68 +- 0.11, 
  the high-energy photon index beta: -2.87 (-0.60, +0.28), 
  the break energy E0:       425 (-51, +58) keV,
  and the peak energy Epeak: 561 (-27, +29) keV.
  
 All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
 while systematic errors are not included.
