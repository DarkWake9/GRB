I.A. Steele, C.M. Copperwheat, A.S. Piascik (Liverpool JMU)
report on behalf of the larger ARI-LJMU collaboration.

The extragalactic transient PS15ccx was reported by Smartt et al. (GCN 18362)
on 2015-09-24 as part of the Pan-STARRS EM followup of GW trigger G184098.

A spectrum of the transient with exposure time 1800 seconds was obtained using the
SPRAT spectrograph on the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope on La Palma on 2015-09-27 starting
at 05:32 UT.  The spectrum was obtained in morning twilight, and consequently has poor signal
to-noise ratio.

Due to the poor signal-to-noise no automatic classification could be made using SNID.  However
a “by eye” comparison with template spectra shows that the spectrum is consistent with a Supernova
Type Ia with redshift around 0.07.
