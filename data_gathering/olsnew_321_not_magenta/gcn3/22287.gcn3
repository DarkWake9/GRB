report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2017-12-15T16:55:22 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected GRB 171215A 
(trigger ID: HEB171215705) in a routine search of the data,which is also 
detected by Fermi/GBM and CALET.

The Insight-HXMT light curve consists of multi-pulses
with T90 ofÂ  32.2s measured from T0+0.84 s.
The 500-ms peak rate, measured from T0+5.0 s, is 2147.7 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 14798.6 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information could be found at:
