We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of an EM
candidate originally reported in GCN #20802. Observations were made with
the SPRAT spectrograph.


iPTF17buo was observed on 2017-03-03 at 21:33UT. We find a mostly
featureless spectrum with weak Halpha and Hbeta in absorption, so we
believe this source to be a dwarf nova in outburst.
