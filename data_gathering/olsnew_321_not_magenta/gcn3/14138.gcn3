The long, IPN localized GRB 121225B (K. Hurley et al., GCN 14103) was 
detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers 
an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 10:01:03.165 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows double-peaked structure starting at 
T0-16s, ending at T0+70s with a duration (T90) of about 53 seconds. The 
fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 4.80(+0.19/-0.25)x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+9s was 8.50 photons/cm^2/s in the 
same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-16s to 
T0+70s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of 
2.17(+0.07/-0.07) (chi^2/d.o.f = 32.8/30).
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
