B. E. Cobb (UC Berkeley) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 081016b
(Page et al. GCN 8381) with a mid-exposure time of 4.3 hours
post-burst (2008-10-17 00:06 UT).  Total summed exposure
times amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

No source is detected at the position of the X-ray
afterglow (Osborne et al. GCN 8383) to approximate
limiting magnitudes of I > 22.1 and J > 19.8. Magnitudes
are calibrated using Landolt standard stars in I, and 2MASS
stars in J.
