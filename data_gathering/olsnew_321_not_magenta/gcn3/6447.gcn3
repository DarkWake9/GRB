A. C. Updike, J. R. Puls, and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report 
on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We used the 0.9m SARA telescope on Kitt Peak to image the field of GRB 
070520B (GCN 6425, Moretti et al.) under decent weather conditions 
beginning 9.5 hours after the burst trigger (279898).  In 52 minutes of 
stacked R-band exposures, we detect no new sources down to a limiting 
magnitude of 20.2 +/- 0.4 based on calibration to 8 USNO B1.0 stars.
