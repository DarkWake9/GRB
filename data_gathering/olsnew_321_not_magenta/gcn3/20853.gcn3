DATE:    17/03/12 14:20:10 GMT
FROM:    Philip Wiseman at MPE/Swift  <wiseman@mpe.mpg.de>

P. Wiseman and P. Schady (both MPE Garching) report:

We re-inspected the observations of GRB 170311A taken with GROND (Schady &
Wiseman, GCN #20848) with respect to the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et
al., GCN #20850).

There is no credible afterglow consistent with or near to this position.
The upper limits remain the same as those reported in GCN #20848.
