E. Berger (Princeton), N. Morrell and M. Roth (LCO) report:

"We observed the position of GRB 071227 (GCN #7148) with the IMACS 
instrument on the Magellan/Baade telescope starting on 2007 Dec. 28 at 
03:52 UT (7.7 hours after the burst).  In a 300-sec R-band exposure we 
detect a single galaxy within the XRT error circle, coincident with the 
position of the UVOT source (GCN #7150).  This object is also visible in 
the DSS.  The galaxy has spiral, edge-on morphology, and a total magnitude 
of R=19.3 mag.  There are no other sources within the XRT error circle to 
a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of R~22.3 mag."
