TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1979
SUBJECT: GRB 030328, optical observations

We imaged the optical afterglow of GRB 030328 (Peterson & Price,
GCN 1974) with the Magellan 6.5-m Clay telescope and LDSS2
imaging/spectrograph on March 29.181 (0.708 days after the
burst). The R-band magnitude is estimated to be 20.8
assuming star "B" (GCN 1977) is R=16.1. This is slightly
brighter than the extrapolation of a powerlaw with alpha=1.0
found by Price & Peterson (GCN 1977).
