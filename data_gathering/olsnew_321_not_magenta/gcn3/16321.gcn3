report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:05:57.62 UT on 23 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140523A (trigger 422507160 / 140523129).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 128.7, DEC = 26.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 08 h 35 m, 26 d 54 '), with an uncertainty
of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks 
with a duration (T90) of about 20 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.003 s to T0+22.720 s is
well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 270.7 (+8.1/-8.6) keV,
alpha = -1.05 +/- 0.01 , and beta = -2.73 (+0.14/-0.19).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.13 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.232 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 37.7 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
