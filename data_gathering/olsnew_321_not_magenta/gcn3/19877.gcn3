S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) on behalf
of the Swift team report:

With the full data set down for Swift trigger 710022 (GCN 19874 & 19875),
we confirm that this trigger is not astrophysical.  Ground analysis of the
BAT data has reduced the image domain significance to 4.3 sigma.
The mask-weighted light curve also shows little significance.

Ground analysis of the XRT data (2.2 ks of exposure, collected from T+1749
to T+8127 sec) shows no unknown point source; the IGR18027-2016 source is
clearly detected.
