S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the
 IBIS/ISGRI data at 16:33:10  UT of March 11, 2022.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  157.9747 deg
DEC.=  +66.0819 deg
with an uncertainty of 3  arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.3 ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 2e-7  erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
