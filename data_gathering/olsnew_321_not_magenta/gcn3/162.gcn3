R. Mark Wagner and Sumner Starrfield report:

We visually examined the region bounded by the ASM error box and IPN annulus
for GRB 981220 on 1998 December 23.12 with the intensified acquisition camera
(FOV: 2 arcmin) on the Boller and Chivens CCD spectrograph at the Steward 
Observatory 2.3-m telescope.  Comparison with the Digitized Sky Survey does
not reveal any new object brighter than about VR = 19.5 in the intersection
of the error regions.
