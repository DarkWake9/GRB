Dan Kelson and Edo Berger (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"On 2005, March 16.347 UT we imaged the XRT error circle of GRB 050315
(GCN 3097) with the newly-comissioned LDSS3 instrument on Magellan/Clay in
the r-band filter.  Within the 6" radius error circle we find a single
bright object which is not present in the DSS at coordinates (J2000):

        RA  =  20:25:54.1
        DEC = -42:36:02.2

with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  We consider this
object to be the optical afterglow of GRB 050315."
