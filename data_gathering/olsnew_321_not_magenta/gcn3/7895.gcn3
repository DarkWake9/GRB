TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7895
SUBJECT: GRB 080623: Swift XRT prompt analysis

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

D. Perez (U. Leicester-U. Jaen), K. Page, P. Evans, A. Beardmore (U. 
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift XRT Team

The XRT began observing the field at 10:47:31.4 UT, 22.0 minutes after the 
BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading, uncatalogued 
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 237.66083, -62.04897 which is equivalent 
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 15h 50m 38.60s
   Dec(J2000) = -62d 02' 56.3"
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 39 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle.

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
2.59e+21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).
