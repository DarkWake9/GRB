The Long Wavelength Array (LWA1, located west of Socorro, New Mexico)
[S.W. Ellingson, et al. http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1204.4816] made
observations on June 17 following the LIGO trigger G298048. The first
observation began at 2017-08-17 13:09:51 UTC (28 minutes after the
trigger) and ran for approximately 1.1 hours.

All observations were centered at frequencies 25.85 MHz and 45.45 MHz,
each with a bandwidth of 19.6 MHz. The FWHM is 15.499 degrees at 25.85
MHz, and 6.648 degrees at 45.45 MHz.

The beam centers for the first observation were: Beam 1: RA 2.391h, Dec
41.810deg; Beam 2: RA 2.431h, Dec 46.572deg; Beam 3: RA 2.803h, Dec
44.202deg; and Beam 4: RA 2.660h, Dec 50.480deg. These were chosen to
observe the maximum of the LIGO skymap available with the initial
notice.

The next observation, using an updated skymap, began at 2017-08-17
19:15:00 UTC (6.6 hours after the trigger) and ran for 4 hours.

The beam centers for the second observation were Beam 1: RA 12.814h, Dec
-13.862deg; Beam 2: RA 12.955h, Dec -17.896deg; Beam 3: RA 13.096h, Dec
-22.024deg; and Beam 4: RA 11.786h, Dec -39.840deg. These coordinates
include the position of the observed transient, as reported by D.A.
Coulter, et al., [GCN 21529], as well as nearby regions.

We plan to continue follow-up observations at the second set of
coordinates over the next few weeks. Data analysis is proceeding.
