"At 07:56:33.25 UT on 14 July 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210714A (trigger 647942198 / 210714331),
which was also detected by Konus-Wind (Frederiks et al. 2021, GCN 30467).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 313.67, DEC = -51.59
(J2000 degrees, equivalent to 20 h 54 m, -51 d 35'),
with a statistical uncertainty
of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32]).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 109 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a bright, FRED-like pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 42 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+25 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 64 +/- 5 keV,
alpha = -0.68 +/- 0.09, and beta = -1.75 +/- 0.01.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.67 +/- 0.15)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 48.9 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.
  

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
