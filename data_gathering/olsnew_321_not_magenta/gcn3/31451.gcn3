The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2022-01-15 at 12:11:39.75 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream. The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 2.090 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136170_48281000.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2022-01-15 
Time:  12:11:39.75 UT
RA: 357.45 (+1.75, -1.18 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 25.28 (+1.03, -0.95 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL J2354.1+2720 at RA: 358.53 deg, Dec: 27.35 deg (2.28 deg away from the best-fit event position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
