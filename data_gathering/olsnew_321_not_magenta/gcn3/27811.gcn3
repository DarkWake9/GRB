Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 200524A (Fana Dirirsa et al. GCN Circ.
27797), collecting 5.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+36.4 ks and T0+55.7 ks. 

Four uncatalogued X-ray sources are detected, of which one ("Source 6")
is  believed to be the afterglow. Using 1644 s of PC mode data and 1
UVOT image, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 213.04474, +60.90538 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14h 12m 10.74s
Dec(J2000): +60d 54' 19.4"

with an uncertainty of 4.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 9.2 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position, and 3 arcsec from
ZTF20abbiixp (Ho et al., GCN 27799).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=3.42 (+0.06, -2.83).
