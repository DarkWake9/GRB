Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward the
GRB 090418 (GCN 9149) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Apr.19.46 UT.
We observed the radio afterglow of the GRB at a position J2000
RA 17:57:15.156, Dec 33:24:20.78 which is 0.39" away from the KAIT
optical afterglow position reported by Chornock et al. (GCN 9148).
The GRB radio afterglow flux density is 219+/-44 uJy.
