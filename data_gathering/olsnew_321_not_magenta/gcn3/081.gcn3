TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  81
SUBJECT: GRB980519 IPN POSITION
DATE:    98/05/20 17:01:26 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

The position of this burst has been obtained by triangulation using
Ulysses and BATSE preliminary data.  It is described by an annulus
centered at RA(2000)=329.485, Dec(2000)=-11.873, whose radius is
89.981 degrees, and whose total width is 4.9 arcminutes.  This
annulus intersects the refined SAX WFC error circle (BeppoSAX GRB
Mail No. 98/16) and is consistent with the position of the optical transient
reported by J. Hjorth (GCN 78).  A figure may be found at
http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/980519.  Processing with the final
data is expected to improve this position.
