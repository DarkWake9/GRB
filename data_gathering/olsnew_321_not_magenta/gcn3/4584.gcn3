At 22:22:40 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) located GRB 
060123.  The burst did not trigger GCN notices because the source was found 
in a long-term (5 minute) image, for which triggers are not currently 
enabled.  The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 179.750, +45.513 
{11h 59m 00s, +45d 30' 47"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin 
(radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light 
curve showed a multi-peaked structure with a duration of about 900 +- 100 
sec.  The peak count rate was ~160 counts/sec (15-50 keV, note the unusual 
energy interval), at ~300 sec after the trigger.  We note that this is a 
very long duration burst, which suggests the possibility of a high-z event.

At 19:14:14 on Jan 24th, 2006 (75.1 ks after the event) Swift began a 
target of opportunity observation of this source.  Analysis of XRT data 
reveals a faint, fading, uncataloged point source at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000):  11h 58m 47.9s
Dec(J2000): +45d 30' 45.5"

with an error circle of 6 arcseconds (90% containment). This position lies 
128 arcseconds from the BAT position of this source. The fading X-ray 
lightcurve of this object strongly suggests that this is a GRB afterglow.

UVOT took a 210 second exposure with the V filter starting at 19:14:14 
UT.  No source was detected with a 3-sigma upper limit of 20.0 mag. at the 
XRT position.
