D. Xu (DARK/NBI), C.-H. Bai, X. Zhang, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the field of  GRB 140311B (Racusin et al., GCN 15945)
using the 1m telescope located in Nanshan, Xinjiang, China.
Observations started at 21:41:05 UT on 2014-03-11 and some 300s/600s
R-band frames were obtained.

The afterglow is detected in each image within the XRT error circle
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/) at coordinates

R.A. (J2000) = 16:49:17.97
Dec. (J2000) = +52:43:26.41

Uncertainty radius: ~1.5 aecsec

The first 300s image reveals that the afterglow has m(R)=20.6 at 29.1
min post-burst, calibrated with nearby two SDSS stars.

Observations are ongoing.
