A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the IPN coordinates
for the HETE burst GRB020531 (Ricker et al, GCN 1399
and Hurley et al., GCN 1402/1407) with the USNOFS
1.0-m telescope on two photometric nights.  Stars
brighter than V=14.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb020531.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 50mas.
