WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 210610A (Page et al.,

GCN 30160) starting at ~14.22 hours after the Swift trigger (Page et al.

GCN 30160). A total of 30x60s images were obtained in the clear (roughly R)

filters. We detect the optical afterglow (e.g. Page et al., GCN 30160)

in the coadd image with a mag of 21.2 +/- 0.2, calibrated to the

Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
