J. Wren, W. T. Vestrand, S. Evans, R. White, and P. Wozniak
report on behalf of the RAPTOR team at Los Alamos National Lab.

The RAPTOR-S telescope responded robotically to INTEGRAL trigger
#2073.  Our first image began at 01:44:13.65 UT, 8 seconds after
receipt of the Integral notice and while the GRB was still ongoing.
Summing our images over the duration of the GRB emission (1:44 UT to
1:52 UT), we marginally detect a possible source very close to our
threshold at the location of the candidate given by Blake and Bloom
(GCN 2870).  Interpreted as an upper limit, these observations
indicate the prompt optical emission remained fainter than R=19.4.
