A. N. Morgan (UC Berkeley) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 130612A (Racusin et al., GCN 14874) with the
1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began at
2013-Jun-12 03h29m25s UT, 6.65 minutes after the Swift Trigger.  In
 mosaics (consisting of 48 ~8 second images for a total effective exposure
time of 6.3 minutes) taken simultaneously in the J, H, and Ks filters, we
detect the optical afterglow (Racusin et al., GCN 14874; Melandri et al.,
GCN 14875). The preliminary K-band reduction is corrupted.  The
observations quoted below began at 3:32 UT, ~9.5 minutes after the Swift
trigger, after an automatic pointing reset by our telescope.

The preliminary photometry yields:

post burst
t_mid (m) exp.(m)  filt  mag   m_err
14.6      6.3     J     17.26  0.12
14.6      6.3     H     16.78  0.15

Observations are ongoing. All magnitudes are given in the Vega system,
calibrated to 2MASS. No correction for Galactic extinction has been made to
the above reported values.
