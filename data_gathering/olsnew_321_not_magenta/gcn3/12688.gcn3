"We have observed the field of GRB 111215A (Oates et al., GCN 12681) with the 1.5m telescope at Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN), Granada, Spain. The data were acquired in the I-band on Dec 15.7537 -- Dec. 15.8168 UT (starting ~4 hour post burst), with a total exposure time of 18x300s. A preliminary analysis reveals no object brighter than I=21.7 in the XRT error circle. The calibration was carried out using the USNO B1.0 catalogue."
