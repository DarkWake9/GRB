report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004 (GCN #1564,
1565, 1568) with the 2.56m Nordical Optical Telescope (NOT) on La
Palma between 20:17:31 UT and 23:55:35 UT on Oct 4 2002.

We find R band magnitudes for five epochs:
      UT       R
   20:17:31  18.14
   20:24:00  18.12
   21:48:20  18.32
   22:37:37  18.40
   23:55:35  18.68

The magnitudes are based on a preliminary photometric calibration.
The USNO star at RA=00:26:58.713, DEC=+18:56:56.61 (GCN #1564) is
found to have a magnitude of R=15.64.

These five observations indicate that a break in the light curve has
occurred. The current decay slope is alpha=1.32. A light curve is
available at:
http://astro.phys.au.dk/~michaelw/GRB021004/lightcurve.ps
Here we have included the observations from GCN #1564, 1566, 1567 and
1570 assuming R=15.64 for the USNO star.

We also have obtained polarimetric observations and a spectrum
covering 3800AA-6800AA. From the lack of Ly-alpha absorption we
conclude that z<2.1."
