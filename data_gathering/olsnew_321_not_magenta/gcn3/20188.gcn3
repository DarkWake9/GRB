Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161117A (trigger #722604)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 20179).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 322.053, -29.612 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  21h 28m 12.8s
  Dec(J2000) = -29d 36' 41.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows three main overlapping peaks, of increasing
amplitude. The tops of the peaks are at T+3, T+35 and T+112 s, respectively.
The burst faded to baseline by about 160 seconds.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 125.7 +- 1.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.00 to T+154.44 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.19 +- 0.12,
and Epeak of 73.9 +- 4.3 keV (chi squared 33.82 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.0 x 10^-5 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+111.35 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
6.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.82 +- 0.00 (chi squared 122.02 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
