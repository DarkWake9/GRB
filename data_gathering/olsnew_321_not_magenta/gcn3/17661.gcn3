SUBJECT: GRB 150402A detected in ground analysis of Swift-BAT data

J. R. Cummings (CPI) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) on behalf of the Swift-BAT science team:

At 00:37:46 Swift-BAT triggered on GRB 150402A (trigger# 636865). Image
attempts were prematurely terminated by a preplanned slew.  A significant
source was found in ground analysis at RA, Dec 173.658, +40.992, which is

RA (J2000)  11h 34m 37.9s
Dec (J2000) 40d 59' 33"

with an estimated uncertainty radius of 2.5 arcmin (90% containment).

The lightcurve shows two symmetrical peaks, each about 5 seconds long, the
second harder and brighter.  The counting rate in BAT of the brighter peak
was about 1500 counts/sec.  T90 was about 14 +- 2 seconds.

A Swift TOO has been requested in order to locate the afterglow.
