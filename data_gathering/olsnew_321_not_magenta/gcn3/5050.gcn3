A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL), V. La Parola (INAF-IASFPA), D. Vanden Berk 
(PSU), F. Marshall (GSFC), on behalf of the SWIFT UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began taking data on the field of GRB060501 3296s after 
the BAT trigger (which includes the 10s V settling exposure). Swift did 
not slew immediately after the trigger because of an earth constraint 
(La Parola et al., GCN 5040). At the edge of the refined XRT error 
circle (La Parola et al., GCN 5042) there are two optical sources which 
are already present in the USNO B1.0 catalogue, but in the summed images 
there are no new sources within the error circle to the following 5 
sigma upper limits:

Filter  T_range(s)  Exp(s)  5sig_UL(mag)
V       3296-16535  927.6   19.3
B       3626-3825   196.6   19.5
U       3422-10542  723.7   19.9
UVW1    9097-9996   885.5   20.0
UVM2    4445-4571   124.1   19.3
UVW2    4036-15788  1082.2  20.5
White (160-650nm)  3313-4030   394.6    20.0

These upper limits are uncorrected for the estimated Galactic reddening 
of E(B-V) = 0.282 mags.
