Millimeter observations of GRB 020813
======================================
The burst has been observed with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer 
in a five-antenna compact configuration from August 13, 21:13 UT to 
August 14, 00:58 UT under good meteorological conditions, on the 
position given in GCN 1474 : (EQ 2000) 19:46:41.865 -19:36:04.76 .
The source was not detected.

Results of UV plane fits fixed on the phase center:

Frequency       Flux and 1 sigma error            Beam size
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 89.188 GHz :  -0.13 (+-0.37) mJy/beam    15.6" by 6.5" at PA -158 deg
232.032 GHz :  -0.63 (+-2.06) mJy/beam     6.5" by 2.6" at PA   27 deg

No other source was detected above the 3 sigma level within the 
half-power width of the primary beams (55.5" at 89.188 GHz and 
31.3" at 232.032 GHz).
