During the recent reactivation of SGR 1935+2154 reported by
INTEGRAL (GCN 30395), GECAM (GCNs 30400, 30415, 30430, 30437, 30449),
Fermi-GBM (GCN 30407), and Konus-Wind (GCNs 30409, 30418, 30450)
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) has triggered on two bright
short soft bursts from this SGR (alerted trigger 1309652996:
http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1309652996/
and trigger 1309983742, which was not alerted).
Additional two weaker short soft bursts observed in the waiting mode
(125-ms time resolution, 8 energy channels) with high S/N were also likely
originated from SGR 1935+2154 (these bursts have not been reported by other
instruments so far).

The following table summarizes the bursts:

*- Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
    the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this trigger.

At the listed times, SGR 1935+2154 was in the FOVs of the CGBM detectors.
