Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200529A (trigger #974942)
(V. D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 27845).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 238.756, -11.076 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 55m 01.3s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 04' 34.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.

The mask weighted light curve shows a complex structure. The
overall structure starts at ~T-5 s and lasts till ~T+100 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 79.57 +- 7.26 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.24 to T+92.92 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.89 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.58 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
