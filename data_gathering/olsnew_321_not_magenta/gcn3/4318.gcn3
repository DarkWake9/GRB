on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

Using the BAT data set from T-60 to T+120 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of GRB 051210 (trigger #171931,
Mangano, et al., GCN 4315).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
(RA,Dec) = 330.194,-57.623 (deg. J2000) {22h 0m 46.6s, -57d 37'21.0"}
2.0 arcmin radius (sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding  
was 90%.

The burst light curve shape is a single, symmetric triangular peak.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.4 +- 0.2 sec (estimated error including  
systematics).

The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.1 +- 0.3.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (8.3 +- 1.4) x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T+0.1 sec in the
15-150 keV band is (7.5 +- 1.2) x 10^-1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
