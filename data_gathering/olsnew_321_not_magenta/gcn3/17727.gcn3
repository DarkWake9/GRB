The long GRB 150418A localized by MAXI/GSC (Serino et al., GCN 17719)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked structure
started at ~T0(MAXI)-16 s with a total  duration of ~29 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
2.94(-0.37,+0.47)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(MAXI)+5 s, of 2.71(-0.37,+0.49)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from ~T0(MAXI)-16 s
to ~T0(MAXI)+14 s) by a simple power-law model yields a power law index
of -2.24(-0.17,+0.17), chi2=0.04/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
