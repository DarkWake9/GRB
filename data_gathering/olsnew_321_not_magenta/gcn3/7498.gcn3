Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080319D (trigger #306793)
(Brown, et al., GCN Circ. 7453).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 99.479, 23.982 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 37m 55.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 58' 56.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 59%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a roughly symmetric peak starting
at ~T+0, peaking at ~T+23, and ending at ~T+50 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 24 +- 4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+5.0 to T+34.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.92 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+25.35 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
