GRB 201006A, detected by Swift/BAT (Gropp et al. GCN 28560),
INTEGRAL/IBAS (Mereghetti et al. GCN 28561) and Fermi/GBM (trig num
623639877), appears likely to be a short burst, despite the real-time
duration estimate (~5s) reported in GCN 28560.
The T90 estimate from downlinked Swift/BAT event data is less than 0.5 seconds.
Follow-up is encouraged.
