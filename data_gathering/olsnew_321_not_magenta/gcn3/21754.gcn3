collaboration:

We observed the field of the Optical Transient discovered by Swift/UVOT 
(Emery et al., GCN 21733)  with  Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Tien Shan 
Astronomical Observatory starting on 2017-08-28 (UT) 18:54:36. We 
obtained several images in R-filter.  The optical transient (Emery et 
al., GCN 21733) is not detected in a combined image.  Preliminary 
photometry of the afterglow is following.

Photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2 magnitudes).
The nearest galaxy (SDSS J014008.25+343414.8) to the transient position 
in coordinates (J2000) 01 40 08.247 +34 34 14.43 +/- 0.25" is marginally 
detected. The galaxy is at a distance of 11.5 arcsec from the transient 
position. The galaxy photometry is R=21.45 +/- 0.45.
