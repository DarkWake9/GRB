In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200114f at T0 = 2020-01-14
02:08:18.239 (UT), an analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 showed that the
GW localization region (LR) was occulted by Earth (GCN #26744).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data over time intervals before and
after T0, when good exposures of the S200114f 90% c.l. LR were available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limits (ULs) in
the 50 MeV - 10 GeV energy band are obtained over different time intervals:

- (T0 + 600 s ; T0 + 700 s): from 4.0e-08 to 4.1e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with an
exposure of about 14% of the S200114f 90% c.l. LR;

- (T0 - 6 hrs; T0 + 6 hrs): from 7.3e-10 to 5.0e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and

- (T0 - 3 days; T0 + 6 hrs): from 7.6e-11 to 5.3e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1,

both with an exposure of about 53% of the S200114f 90% c.l. LR;

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode.
