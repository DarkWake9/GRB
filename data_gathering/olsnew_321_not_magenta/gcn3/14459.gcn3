report:

We observed the field of GRB 130427A (Maselli, et al., GCN 14448) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 27.34 to 2013/04 27.39 UTC (0.25 to
1.67 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours exposure
in the r' and i' bands and 0.45 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source at afterglow location reported by Elenin et al. (GCN 14450),
in comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

  i' 14.46 +/- 0.01
  Z  14.13 +/- 0.03
  Y  14.02 +/- 0.03
  J  14.05 +/- 0.02
  H  13.77 +/- 0.03

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
