Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151001A (trigger #657286)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 18373).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 233.722, 10.984 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 34m 53.2s
  Dec(J2000) = +10d 59' 01.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-6 s, peaks at ~T0, end ends at~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.94 +- 1.07 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.28 to T+4.53 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.17 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.7 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
