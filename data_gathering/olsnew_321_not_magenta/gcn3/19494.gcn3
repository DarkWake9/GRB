(i.e. the Swift-BAT team):

Using the data set from T-240 to T+500 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 160601A (trigger #688452) (Kocevski, et al., GCN Circ.
19478).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 234.923, 64.532 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 39m 41.6s
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 31' 53.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 66%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single pluse
starting ~T-0.1 sec, and ending around ~T+0.15 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.12 +- 0.02 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.02 to T+0.12 sec is
best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law
index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.04 +- 0.24.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.6 +- 1.1 x 10^-08
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.45
sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec. All
the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
