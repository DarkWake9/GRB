M. J. B. Rosell, Steven Janowiecki, Karl Gebhardt, and J. Craig Wheeler, 
on behalf of the LIGO Hobby-Eberly Telescope Response (LIGHETR) team, 
report the spectroscopic observation of the field of S190426c (GCN 
#24208) with the VIRUS IFU array. We sampled a prioritized list of 5 
galaxies from the GLADE catalog that overlapped with the LIGO 
probability map and the observable pupil of the HET. The resulting data 
cube covers the wavelength 350 to 550 nm with a resolving power of 750. 
The effective limiting magnitude in the B band was 22 magnitudes. Each 
field is 50x50 arc seconds. We observed, in order, galaxies:
305.064514+47.343445
306.223328+56.174004
310.997894+53.242306
306.510681+55.881222
309.586700+59.537640
We note that 310.997894+53.242306 is a known AGN. We find no obvious 
evidence of an optical transient. A more detailed report of the results 
will be submitted later.
