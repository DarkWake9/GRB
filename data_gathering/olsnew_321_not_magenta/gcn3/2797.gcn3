We observed the HETE WXM error region of XRF 040912 (Butler et al. GCN 2701)  with the wide-field imager MegaCam (36 2048 x 4612 pixel CCDs, 1 square degree FOV), mounted on the 3.6-m CFH Telescope.

Two exposures with integration time of 860s each, in the i' band have been performed consecutively starting on October 5.4197 UT (T_grb+22.8 days). 

We looked for a possible SN emission for the 22 X-ray sources detected with Chandra 
(Butler et al., GCN Circ=2716).  The observation results follow:

* Source was at the CCD line separation and was missed in one image
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We did not consider sources at distances greater than 2.5" from the 
X-ray source position. 
Our conclusions from these observations are:

1- If source #4 is the afterglow of XRF 040912 (as suggested in GCN 2731), we do not observed any SN emission down to i=23.2+/0.2 mag at 22.8 days after the burst event.

2- Source #13, which has been considered as the tentative afterglow of XRF 040912 (GCN 2728) does not appear to vary from the second Magellan observation. 

We note that source #6 is coincident with an underlying galaxy with i'=19 mag, it has a decaying behavior in X-rays (Butler et al. GCN=2716) and shows the highest V-i' color index (V-i'=2.05, V magnitude reported by Gorosabel et al., GCN 2724), requiring a very red galaxy, or a rebrightning.  
This resemble the case of XRF 040701 (Barraud et al. GCN 2620) for which the potentially associated Chandra source (Fox et al. GCN 2626) was coincident with a z=0.2146 emission-line galaxy (Kelson et al. GCN 2631) with lower limit R~17.9 mag that possibly prevented the observation of a delayed SN emission, assuming a SN fainter than SN 1998bw and more similar to SN2002ap or SN1994I (Pian et al. GCN 2638). 
Further observations of source #6 are welcome.

Chandra sources detected in the i' band, can be found at
