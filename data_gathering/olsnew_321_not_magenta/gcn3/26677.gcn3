The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:45:51 UT on 9 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200109A (trigger 600227156.894404 / 200109074).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 284.7, Dec = 68.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 58m, 68d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 40.0 degrees.
