Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151229A (trigger #668689)
(Kocevski, et al., GCN Circ. 18745).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 329.363, -20.732 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 57m 27.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 43' 56.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 51%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows  single peak starting at ~T-0.1 sec,
peaking at ~T+0.1 sec, and ending at ~T+1.7 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
1.78 +- 0.44 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.11 to T+2.34 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.84 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.2 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
