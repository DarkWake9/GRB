J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) and N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) report:

"Following our initial report in GCN 5066, we continued observing the
XRT location of Swift short GRB 060502B (Troja et al., GCNs 5055,5063)
in the R band on the MDM 1.3m telescope on May 3 and 4 UT.  In a summed
75 minute exposure centered at May 3 09:02 UT, we clearly detect the faint
galaxy candidate "G1" seen in the Gemini North image of Berger et al.
(GCN 5064) that was taken about 1.5 hours later.  Observing on the
following night, a summed 105 minute exposure centered at May 4 08:56 UT
again shows "G1" at about the same magnitude.  We measure R~23.9 for this 
object, somewhat brighter than Berger et al. (GCN 5064).  MDM images of
this field are posted at
