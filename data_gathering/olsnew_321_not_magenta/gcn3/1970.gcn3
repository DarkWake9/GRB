V. Beckmann and S.E. Shaw on behalf of the INTEGRAL Science Data Center,
J.-P. Roques on behalf of the SPI instrument team, Sergei Molkov (IKI),
and the INTEGRAL Science Working team report the detection of a possible
GRB at 08:42:24 UTC on March 23, 2003.

The burst lasted about 5 seconds.

The preliminary position is RA 19h 49m, DEC -12deg 30' (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 2 degrees radius. The preliminary peak flux over
2 seconds is about 2 * 10^-7 ergs/cm**2/sec between 25 and 100 keV.

The burst has been detected by SPI at large off-axis angle (14.5
degrees), outside the field of view of IBIS.
