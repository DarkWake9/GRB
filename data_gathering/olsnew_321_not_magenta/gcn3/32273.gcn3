V. Swain (IITB), H. Kumar (IITB), K. Angail (IAO), V. Bhalerao (IITB), G.
C. Anupama (IIA), S. Barway (IIA) report on behalf of the GIT team:

We observed GRB 220623A detected by Swift (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 32243;
Kennea et al., GCN 32244), AstroSat (Gopalakrishnan et al., GCN 32246) and
AGILE (Ursi et al., GCN 32247), with the 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT).
The observations started at 15:05:15 UT on 2022-06-23, 8.02 hours after the
Swift trigger. We obtained multiple 300-sec exposures in the g', r' and i'
filters. We did not detect any new source in our stacked images within the 2.1
arcsec radius circle around R.A.= 09h 41m 34.50s, Dec.= +75d 49' 15.6” (Phil
Evans et al. GCN #32248). The obtained upper limits follow as:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD(mid) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Exposure(sec) | Filter | Lim_mag(5-sigma) |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 2459754.132298985 | 8.10 | 3 x 300 (stacked) | r' | > 21.10 |

 2459754.141603815 | 8.32 | 2 x 300 (stacked) | g' | > 21.01 |

 2459754.149142145 | 8.50 | 2 x 300 (stacked) | i' | > 20.23 |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

These upper limits are consistent with Benjamin et al.(GCN #32271), Alexei
et al.(GCN #32255), Daniele et al.(GCN #32253), Alexander et al.(GCN
#32252), Filipp et al.(GCN #32245). The magnitudes are calibrated against
PanSTARRS DR1 (Chambers et al., 2016) and not corrected for Galactic
extinction.


The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) with funding from DST-SERB and
IUSSTF. It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle),
operated by IIA. We acknowledge funding by the IITB alumni batch of 1994,
which partially supports operations of the telescope. Telescope technical
