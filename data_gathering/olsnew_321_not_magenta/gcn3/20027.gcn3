The long-duration GRB 161010A
(INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI detection: Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 20021) 
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=48993.832 s UT (13:36:33.832).

The burst light curve shows a single multipeaked emission episode
started at T0-4.7 s with a total duration of ~22 s.
The emission is seen up to 3 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB161010_T48993/
Note: 'dips' in the count rate are due
to the GRB source occultation by the s/c structure.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 3.36(-0.38,+0.40)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+1.008 s,
of 1.07(-0.26,+0.26)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.10(-0.19,+0.23),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.17(-0.21,+0.13),
the peak energy Ep = 205(-39,+56) keV
(chi2 = 62/68 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
