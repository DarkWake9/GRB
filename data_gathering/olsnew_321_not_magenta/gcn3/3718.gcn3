report:

We observed optical afterglow of GRB 050730 (Holland et al., GCN #3704)
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK
National Observatory, Turkey). Observations were made under partially
clouded sky.  We obtained a set of 180s images in BVRI filters. Object
was clealy detected in I and R and marginally in V. Using reference star
from Holman et al. (GCN #3716) we estimate R=21.24+-0.17 at 19:01 UT,
July 31.
