D. Morris (PSU), D. Burrows (PSU), N. Gehrels (GSFC), P. Boyd 
(GSFC-UMBC),  L. Angelini (GSFC-JHU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT 
team:

We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit observation of 
GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN4682), with a total exposure of 337 
seconds. We find an uncataloged, fading source at:

RA(J2000) = 13h 31m 43.4s
Dec(J2000) = +35d 03' 02.0"

This position is 99.0 arcseconds from the BAT position given in GCN 4682 
and 1.8 arcseconds from the optical afterglow position reported in GCN 
4683 (Fynbo et al) and refined in GCN 4684 (Boyd et al). We estimate an 
uncertainty of 4 arcseconds radius (90% containment).

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
