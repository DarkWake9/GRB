J.D. Gropp (PSU), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), M. J. Moss (GWU),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 22:02:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210323A (trigger=1038247).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 317.952, +25.378 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 21h 11m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 22' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single spike
structure with a duration of about 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~10,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 22:03:43.6 UT, 85.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 317.94609, 25.36990 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 21h 11m 47.06s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 22' 11.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 34 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.17 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 5.9
(+3.84/-3.14) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 88 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.132.
