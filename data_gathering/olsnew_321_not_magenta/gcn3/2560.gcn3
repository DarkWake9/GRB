TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2560
SUBJECT: GRB 040403: a long GRB detected with INTEGRAL

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), J. Borkowski, M. Beck (ISDC) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team, S. Shaw on behalf of the INTEGRAL
Science data Centre (ISDC) and the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

A 35 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on April 3 at 05:08:08 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band. Its coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A. 07h 40m 55s
Dec. 68deg 12' 39''

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin.

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 0.4
photons/cmsq/s (3 x 10^-8 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time). From the
preliminary spectral analysis this GRB seems to be X-ray rich.

Further analysis is underway.
