The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:16:15 UT on 26 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210626A (trigger 646388180.992174 / 210626345).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 216.0, Dec = -4.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 24m, -4d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 76.0 degrees.
