A.J. Castro-Tirado, A. de Ugarte Postigo, M. Jelinek, 
J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), J. Licandro and D. Bramich 
(ING La Palma), report:

"We have observed the XRT position of GRB 070223 (Vetere et al. GCN
6130) with the 4.2m WHT (+LIRIS) telescope at the Spanish Observatorio
del Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma. The observations were carried
out in the JHK-bands starting on Feb 23.165-23.195 UT. We detect a faint 
object in all bands consistent with the one reported by Mirabal et al. 
(GCNC 6162) and also with the XRT position given by Vetere et al. 
Further imaging is required to confirm if this is the NIR afterglow 
to GRB 070223."
