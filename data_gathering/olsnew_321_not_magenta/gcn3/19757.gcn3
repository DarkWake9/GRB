E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Kusakin (Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute), I. Reva 
(Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160801A  (D'Elia et al., GCN 19744 ) with 
Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory. We 
obtained several images in R filter starting on August 01 (UT) 15:10:55. We 
do not  detect any optical source within enhanced XRT error position (Goad 
et al., GCN 19746). Preliminary photometry of a combined image is following

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS DR9 stars

Our preliminary  photometry of the SDSS object (Cano et al.,  GCN 19753) 
which is also mentioned by Moskvitin et al. (GCN 19755)  is R=21.1+/-0.1 and 
based on the same nearby SDSS stars.
