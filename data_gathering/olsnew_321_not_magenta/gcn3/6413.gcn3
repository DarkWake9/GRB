Using the data set from T-239.4 to T+302.8 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070517
(trigger #279494)  (Vergani, et al., GCN Circ. 6411).  The BAT
ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 277.603, -62.297 deg which is
    RA(J2000) = 18h 30m 24.7s
    Dec(J2000) = -62d 17' 49.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%. The mask-weighted light curve shows a
single peak lasting from approximately T+0 to T+10 seconds.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.0 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.4 to T+10.6 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.81 +- 0.24. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+1.65 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
