We imaged the field of GRB050607 with the robotic 60-cm REM telescope
located at La Silla, Chile. Observations were performed in fully
automated mode simultaneously in the near infrared and in the optical,
starting approximately 47 seconds after the alert. REM is equipped with
the REMIR near infrared camera (10x10 sq arcmin FoV, JHK filters) and
the ROSS optical spectrograph/imager (10x10 sq arcmin FoV, VRI filters
and AMICI prism). Observations were performed under good seeing
conditions.

A quick-look analysis does not reveal any new bright object in H band
down to approximately the 15th magnitude.
