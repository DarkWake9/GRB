The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:04:43 UT on 9 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220309A (trigger 668498688.984364 / 220309253).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 147.0, Dec = -0.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 48m, 0d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59.0 degrees.
