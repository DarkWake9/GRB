S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick), N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. Cucchiara (STScI), and A. Fruchter (STScI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the location of GRB160504A (Malesani et al., GCN 19382) with the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) on the 8 m Gemini North telescope beginning at 5:24 UT on 5 May 2016 (~ 9.9 hr after the Swift trigger).  A total of 10 min of integration was obtained in each of the J, H, and K filters.  Within the enhanced XRT localization (Goad et al., GCN 19386) we identify a single faint source at J2000.0 coordinates:

  RA: 11:20:17.18
  Dec: +56:00:04.7

Using a nearby point source from 2MASS for calibration, we calculate the following AB magnitudes for this object:

J = 23.6 +/- 0.4
H = 23.8 +/- 0.4
K = 23.3 +/- 0.2

Given the faintness of the object, we cannot determine at this time if it associated with GRB160504A.
