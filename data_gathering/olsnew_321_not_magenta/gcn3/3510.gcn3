D. Gotz and S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano) on behlaf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

GRB 050603 (Retter et al., GCN 3509) has been detected also by the IBIS 
instrument on board INTEGRAL in the 40-300 keV energy band. Being outside 
of the field of view of the instrument, this burst cannot be localized.

The burst starts at 2005-06-03T06:29:03 UT and has a multipeaked light 
curve, showing at least 3 distinct peaks, with the last one being the 
brightest. The GRB lasts 10 s, so it does not belog to the short class.
