MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to
HETE GRB051028 (GCN 4172) at very nice Moscow weather.
Unfortunately, the remoute observations was delayted due to manage computer 
problems. Now we find new earlier images. First image was at 2005-10-28 
16:23:14 (not at 16:59:56 UT as we noted in GCN4171, GCN4173) i.e. 2h 46min 
after GRB time.

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
Final results: the uper limits on OT (M. Jelinek et al. GCN4175) are

UT (start)    T-T_GRB  TotExpTime  3sigma limit

16:23:14     02h 46 m     45 s        17.9
16:59:56     03h 23 m     45 s        17.5
17:32:40     04h 12 m    360 s        18.3
20:01:04     06h 41 m   1050 s        19.6
21:46:43     08h 26 m   1200 s        19.4
