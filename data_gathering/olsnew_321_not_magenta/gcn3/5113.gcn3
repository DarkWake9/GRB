The long GRB 060510A (Swift-BAT trigger #209351;
Krimm et al., GCN 5095; Barbier et al., GCN 5108)
triggered Konus-Wind at 27796.301 s UT (07:43:16.301).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~25 s,
fluence 2.55(-0.22,+0.07)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and the 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+7.488 s
4.29(-0.72, +0.63)x10^-6  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).
The burst shows a strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution.

Fitting the time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+24.064 s; in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = 1.661(-0.076, +0.072)
and Ep = 184 (-24, +36) keV (chi2 = 63/48 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
