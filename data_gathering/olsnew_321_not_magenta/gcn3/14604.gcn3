The optical source identified by Swift/UVOT in the field of MAXI  
GRB130505B (Kocevski et al., GCN circ. 14594) and coincident with SDSS  
J091721.89+014203.2 has dimmed by more than 3 magnitudes between 58.6  
and 86.7 ks after the trigger (Serino et al., GCN circ. 14586), and it  
is not detected in the last exposure, centered at 153.9 ks, down to a  
3 sigma upper limit of u=22.1.

This source is seen to be fading also by Swift/XRT between 58.6 and  
163.0 ks with a decay index ~2.6. The spectrum can be fitted with an  
absorbed power-law with a spectral photon index of 2.19 (+2.09,  
-0.79). The best fitting absorption column is 1.6 (+4.1, -1.6) × 10^21  
cm-2, consistent with the Galactic value of 2.4 x 10^20 cm-2 (Kalberla  
et al. 2005). Assuming this spectrum, the last XRT detection  
correspond to a 0.3-10 keV flux of (4.5 ± 2.2) x 10^-14 erg cm-2 s-1.

The very fast optical decay is unprecedented in GRB afterglows, and we  
cannot exclude a Galactic transient nature for this transient.
