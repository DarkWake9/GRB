TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2940
SUBJECT: Fourth Epoch VLA observations of SGR 1806-20
DATE:    05/01/06 21:28:18 GMT
FROM:    Patrick B. Cameron at Caltech  <pbc@astro.caltech.edu>

P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

"We observed a fourth epoch of the position of SGR 1806-20 with the Very
Large Array (VLA) in A-configuration on 2005 Jan 6.77 UT (t ~ 9.9 days
after the giant flare. See GCN #2920, #2928, #2929, #2933, #2934, #2935,
ATEL #373, #375).

We find the following preliminary flux densities:

Freq (GHz)    Flux density (mJy)
--------------------------------
1.43	      96 +/- 2
4.86	      39 +/- 2
8.46	      24 +/- 1

Error Bars are 1 sigma. We find an angular size at 8.46 GHz of about 80
mas. We see no variation in this diameter over the last 4 days.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation."
