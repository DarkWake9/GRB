A.J.Castro-Tirado, R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger
collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB130608A (Krimm et al. GCNC 14827) with the
BOOTES-2/TELMA telescope located in Malaga, Spain, starting at 02h31m UT
(136 minutes after the burst, when the source rose above the local
horizon). No new source is visible within the XRT error circle.

During a first epoch we combined 11 images with an unfiltered exposure of
60 seconds each that begun at 02h31m45s (136 minutes after the burst) and
ended at 02h44m21s (mean time 142 minutes after the burst), and a limiting
magnitude of 18.8 was obtained when compared to the values of R2Mag of the
field stars as stated in the USNO-B1 catalog.

During a 2nd epoch we combined 22 images with an unfiltered exposure of 60
seconds each that begun at 3h00m11s (165 minutes after the burst) and ended
at 3h22m08s (mean time 176 minutes after the burst), and we obtained a
limiting magnitude of 19.5 when compared to the values of R2Mag of the
field stars as stated in the USNO-B1 catalog.
