and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 161218A (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 20283) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 03:47:31.89 on 18 December 2016.
No real time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because the real time
communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal) between 3:43 and 3:52.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a FRED-like structure starting at T+3 sec,
peaking at T+5 sec and ending at T+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 5.1 +- 0.2 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
