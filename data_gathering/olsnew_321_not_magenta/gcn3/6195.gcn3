J. P. Halpern & E. Armstrong (Columbia U.) report on behalf
of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team.

"We acquired R-band observations of INTEGRAL GRB 070311
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 6189) using the MDM 1.3m telescope
on Mar. 11 02:44-03:28 UT.  The IR afterglow discovered by
Covino et al. (GCN 6190) and confirmed by Bloom (GCN 6191)
is well detected in our images.  In an uncalibrated image,
we measure a preliminary magnitude of R = 21.12 +/- 0.09
at a mean time of 02:47 UT, or 54 minutes post-burst.  This
is with respect to a comparison star with USNO-B1.0 magnitude
R2=16.67 at (J2000) 05:50:11.83, +03:22:25.2.
