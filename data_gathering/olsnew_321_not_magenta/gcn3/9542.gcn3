(ESO, INAF/OAB), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

We have observed the field of GRB090618 (Schady et al.,
GCN 9512) with the 6-m telescope of the SAO RAS in
Caucasus. We obtained B, Rc and Ic images as well as a
low-resolution spectrum under non favorable weather conditions.
The range and resolution of the spectrum were 3900-9200AA
and FWHM=15-17A, respectively. A preliminary processing of
the spectrum showed a faint emission line at 5748.55A which we
interpret as [OII] 3727A. A corresponding redshift of 0.54 is in
full agreement with one obtained by Cenko et al. (GCN 9518).
Because of strong night sky OH bands and low resolution of the
spectrum we could not clearly detect expected Hbeta and
[OIII]4959,5007A lines. The photometry was calibrated using a
number of SDSS stars in the field. Below we present a summary
of some of our observations:
