TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2343
SUBJECT: XRF030723, BVRcIc field photometry update
DATE:    03/08/06 15:50:41 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

Because an optical afterglow (Fox et al., GCN 2323) has been
discovered for the HETE XRF030723 (Prigozhin et al., GCN 2313),
we have updated our field photometry file (Henden GCN 2317)
to include a total of 3 photometric nights.  The last two
nights were repositioned so that the field center corresponds
to the SXC error circle center, with the OT therefore only
a couple of arcmin from the calibration field center.

This file can be found at:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030723.dat
Mean photometric errors are under 0.02mag and mean coordinate
errors (UCAC2) are less than 100mas.

No changes are expected beyond this point.
