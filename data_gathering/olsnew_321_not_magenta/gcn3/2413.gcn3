TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 36731 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 5 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.9E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 167.741,  18.554 degrees, whose radius is 85.851 +/-  0.017
degrees (3 sigma).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -40 and -70 degrees, that is, to
those portions of the annulus between RA, Decl= 88, -16 and 108, -49
degrees, and between RA, Decl= 139, -64 and 216, -57 degrees.

This localization can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
