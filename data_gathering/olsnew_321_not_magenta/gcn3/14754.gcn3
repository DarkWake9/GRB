WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of
the KAIT GRB team:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 130604A (Melandri et al., GCN 14752)
with the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) located at
Lick Observatory. Observations started at 06:57:07 UT, 161 s after the
burst, with an automatic sequence in V, I, and clear filters (20 s
exposure for each image). We do not detect the afterglow at the position
reported by Perley (GCN 14753). We estimate the limiting magnitude in
our first clear-band (close to R) image to be about 18.5 at a time of
330 s after the burst. 

Continuing observations are in progress.
