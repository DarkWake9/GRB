The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:00:05 UT on 15 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200615A (trigger 613893610.082594 / 200615250).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 48.1, Dec = 5.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 12m, 5d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
