D. Frederiks, S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, A. Kozlova,

and T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 181110A (Swift-BAT trigger #871316: (Evans et al.,
GCN  23413; Lien et al., GCN 23420; T0(BAT)= 08:43:31.320 UT)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in
the 22-380 keV band reveals a count rate increase in the interval
from ~T0(BAT)-42 s to ~T0(BAT)+98 s.
No statistically significant emission has been detected above
380 keV.

The KW light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB181110A/

Modeling the KW 3-channel spectrum (from T0(BAT)-36 s to T0(BAT)+32 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff (CPL) model
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.63(-0.26,+0.34) and Ep = 48(-27,+14) keV.

The total burst fluence in the 15-1500 keV band
is (1.1 Â± 0.2)x10^-5 erg/cm^2.

Assuming z = 1.505 (Perley et al., GCN 23421) and a standard cosmology
model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.30, and Omega_Lambda = 0.70, 
the burst isotropic energy release E_iso is ~1.1x10^53 erg (1-10000 keV,
rest frame), and the rest-frame peak energy is ~120 keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
