SUBJECT: GRB 070805: Swift/UVOT initial analysis

D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU), P. Kuin (MSSL), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC),
and A. M. Parsons (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650
nm) filter starting 1977 seconds after the BAT trigger.  No afterglow
candidate has been found in the initial data products. The overlap of the
sub-image and the BAT error circle is uncertain at this time. The 8'x8'
region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle.  Because of the density of catalogued stars, further
analysis is required to report an upper limit for any afterglow in the
region. No correction has been made for the extinction of E(B-V)=0.202.
