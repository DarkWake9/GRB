H.-F. Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:54:50.85 UT on 14 Mar 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150314A (trigger 448001693 / 150314205),
which was also detected by the Swift (Hagen et al. 2015, GCN 17573)
and Fermi LAT (Axelsson et al. 2015, GCN 17576). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position. The trigger resulted
in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was accepted and the
spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. The initial angle
from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a bright single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 10.7 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0+0.002 s to T0+13.472 s is best fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 311 +/- 5 keV, alpha = -0.60 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.32 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.53 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+2.144 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 67.1 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
