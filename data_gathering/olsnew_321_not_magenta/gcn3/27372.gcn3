and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S200311bg,
T0 = 2020-03-11 11:58:53.398 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 27358), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-3 min to 
T0+15 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy trigger
mode at the trigger time of S200311bg. Using the CAL data, we have
searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from -60 sec
to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates. There
was no significant overlap with the LVC high probability localization 
region at T0+-60 sec.  The CAL FOV was centered at RA = 191.3 deg, 
Dec = +51.5 deg at T0.
