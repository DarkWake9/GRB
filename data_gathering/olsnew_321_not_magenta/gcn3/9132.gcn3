Rob Preece (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:28:05.25 UT on 12 April 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located a weak GRB 090412 (trigger 261192487 / 090412061).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 0.3, DEC = -49.8 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 00 h 01 m, -48 d 48 '), with an uncertainty
of 9.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a weak pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.5 s (8-1000 keV).

Since the source is very weak, it is not possible to
perform any spectral analysis."
