Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:49:06.48 UT on 24 April 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160424A (trigger 483191350 / 160424492),
which was also detected by the Swift (Lien et al. 2016, GCN 19335)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 18 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 7.6 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0+0.003 s to T0+6.528 s is well fit by a power law function
with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index
is -1.1 +/- 0.1 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak,
is 220 +/- 30 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.6 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.832 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 7.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
