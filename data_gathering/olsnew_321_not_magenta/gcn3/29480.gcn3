Swift observed the field of IceCube 210210A (GCN Circ. 29454) between 14:14:46 on February 10, 2021
and 00:03:08 on February 11, 2021. Due to a technical problem only two pointings were done with a
radius of 0.2 degrees each, one centered on the event position and one centered on 4FGL J1342.7+0505.
A total of 7.5 ks of cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data was collected.

We found 6 X-ray sources, as detailed below. These sources are either known or unknown but with
count rate consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not
claim any of them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 210210A.

Source 5 is coincident with the best position of the assumed optical counterpart to 4FGL J1342.7+0505 reported by SIMBAD. Its count-rate in our follow up data is 2.6 (+/-0.3) x 10^-2 ct s^-1. This source has previously been observed by Swift on 2009 August 29 and is in the 2SXPS catalogue (2SXPS J134243.1+050425) with a count-rate of 2.5 (+/-1.1) x 10^-2 ct s^-1. This is consitent with our new measurement.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 2-3 x 10^-3 ct/sec.
