Guziy (Univ. of Nikolaev) and D. R. Xiong, Y. F. Fan, J. M. Bai, C. J. Wang, Y. X. Xin, X. H. Zhao (Yunnan Observatories of CAS) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 210205A by Swift (Dichiara et al. GCNC 29397), the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang Astronomical Observatory (China) started to gather images after the twilight as soon as it was possible. No new source is detected within the Swift/XRT enhanced position (Osborne et al. GCNC 29399) down to 18.3 mag in the co-added z-band images (7x120 s) starting at 12:22 UT. The non-detection is consistent with the limits reported by both Swift/UVOT (Dichiara et al. GCNC 29397) and GWAC-F60A (Xin et al. GCNC 29398).

We thank the staff at Lijiang observatory for their excellent support.
