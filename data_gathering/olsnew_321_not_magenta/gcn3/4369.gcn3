E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) reports:

"We observed the BAT error circle of the short GRB 051221 (GCN 4365) with
GMOS on the Gemnini-north telescope starting on 2005 Dec. 21.194 UT (2.8
hours after the burst).  A total of 40 min were obtained in the r-band 
under excellent seeing conditions (0.45").  Within the XRT error circle 
(GCN 4366) we detect a single source at a position coincident with the 
source reported in GCN 4367:
	RA =  21:54:48.64
	DEC= +16:53:27.44

Further analysis is in progress."
