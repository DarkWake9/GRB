on behalf of the ZTF collaboration
We obtained spectroscopy of ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc (Andreoni et al., GCN
31590, Perley et al., GCN 31592, Pankov et al. GCN 31593) with the Gemini
Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS-N) mounted on the Gemini-North 8-meter
telescope on Mauna Kea, under our ToO program GN-2022A-Q-127 (PI: Ho). We
obtained 2x450 second exposures using the B600 grating and 2x450 second
exposures using the R400 grating, starting 2022-02-15 14:35 UTC.

After two independent reductions using DRAGONS (Labrie et al. 2019) and
Pyraf we report a featureless red continuum. The lack of any narrow or
broad lines in our spectral coverage (380nm to 910nm, although the S/N is
low blueward of 550 nm) is consistent with a cosmological origin (and
suggests an AGN-like or a Galactic origin is unlikely).

We thank the observers and the Gemini staff for their rapid response in
facilitating this Target of Opportunity observation.
