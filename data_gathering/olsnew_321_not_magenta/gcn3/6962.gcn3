We have imaged the field of GRB 071021 (T. Sakamoto, et al.;
GCN 6958) with the TNT 0.8m telescope at Xinglong
Observatory started from  09:55:06.5 UT, 813.8880 after
the burst.  A series of White and R band images were
obtained, no new source was found in our combined
image within the error region of the XRT
(T. Sakamoto, et al.; GCN 6958) and the location reported 
by C. Guidorzi et al (GCN 6959)

The 3-sigma limit derived from
USNO-B1.0 R2 mag were: 
------------------------------------
Band     Mid time     Exp time  Limit Mag
 
White   0.72 hours     40*20s     20.32 
R      1.38 hours      12*300s    20.85
