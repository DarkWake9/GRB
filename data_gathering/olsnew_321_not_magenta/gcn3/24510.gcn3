report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:39:59.72 UT on 12 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190512A (trigger 579364804 / 190512611)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Bernardini et al. 2019, GCN 24501)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 24 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.1 s to T0+27.7 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.4 +/- 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 110 +/- 25 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.4 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.13 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.0 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2."

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
