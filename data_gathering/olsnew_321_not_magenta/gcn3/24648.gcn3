and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190521g,
T0 = 2019-05-21 03:02:29.447 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and  Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24621), the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-8 min to 
T0+8 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy trigger 
mode at the trigger time of S190521g. Using CAL data, we have 
searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from -60 sec
to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates.   The
90% upper limit of CAL is 6.0x10^-6 erg/cm2/s (10-100 GeV) when the
summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 30%. The CAL FOV was 
centered at RA=205.7 deg, Dec=49.2 deg at T0.
