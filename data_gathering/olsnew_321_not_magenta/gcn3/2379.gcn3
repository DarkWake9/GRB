A. Oksanen on behalf of the Nyrola Observatory GRB Team
and the AAVSO International High Energy Network reports:

Total of five 24 x 16 arcmin fields covering most of the HETE WXM error
circle of XRF030824 (HETE 2821) was imaged with the 0.4m SCT at the
Nyrola Observatory starting at August 24, 2003 20:40 UT, 4.0 hours after 
the inital burst under varying sky conditions (some clouds and haze).
 
Total of 22 240s Rc-exposures were combined and compared to
the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS2R). 

No new objects were found to the image limits of R = 17.5 - 19.0.
