E. Berger (Harvard), D.B. Fox (PSU), and N. Tanvir (Leicester) report:

"In addition to the spectroscopic observations described in GCN 9156, we
also imaged the field of GRB 090417B with GMOS in the griz filters
starting on 2008 April 18.38 (17.7 hours after the burst).  A total of 360
sec were obtained in gri, and a total of 540 sec was obtained in z.  We
find the following magnitudes for the SDSS galaxy coincident with the XRT
afterglow position:

g = 22.47+/-0.16 mag	(SDSS: 23.0+/-0.5 mag)
r = 21.62+/-0.10 mag	(SDSS: 21.62+/-0.16 mag)
i = 21.31+/-0.12 mag	(SDSS: 21.41+/-0.09 mag)
z = 21.49+/-0.30 mag	(SDSS: 20.78+/-0.25 mag)

Thus, we find no evidence for brightening compared to the SDSS archival
magnitudes."
