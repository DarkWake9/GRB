The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:23:28 UT on 15 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201215A (trigger 629706213.838334 / 201215266).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 211.8, Dec = 42.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 07m, 42d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118.0 degrees.
