At 03:12:42.80 UTC (11562.80 s UT) on 24 Mar 2003, the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments detected event H2461, a long GRB.

The WXM flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN
Notice at 03:13:07 UTC, 25 sec after the beginning of the burst 

Ground analysis of the WXM WXM data for the burst produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Notice at 04:23:48 UT, 71 minutes
after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 16.  The WXM location
can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 7 arcminutes in
radius and is centered at

WXM:   RA = +13h 37m 11s, Dec = -00d 19' 22" (J2000).

The SXC turns off at orbit dawn; this happened 10 sec before the
beginning of the burst, and therefore there will be no SXC localization
for this burst.

The burst duration t_90 in the 30-400 keV band was ~ 8.7 s.  The
fluence of the burst was 1.6 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and the peak flux over 5
s was ~1.4 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 (i.e., ~ 5 x Crab flux) in the same
energy band.
