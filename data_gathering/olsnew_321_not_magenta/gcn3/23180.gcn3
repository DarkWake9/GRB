The short-duration GRB 180824A
(IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN 23174)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=36319.887 s UT (10:05:19.887).

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~2 s.
The emission is seen up to ~1.2 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.02(-0.34,+0.41)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.012 s,
of 7.15(-3.46,+4.02)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the main pulse
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 16 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
withÂ  alpha = -0.04(-0.85,+1.65),
and Ep = 375(-128,+267) keV (chi2 = 16/18 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
