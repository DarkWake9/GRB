report on behalf of the iPTF and GROWTH collaborations:

We have performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G268556 (LVC, GCN 20364)
using the Palomar 48-inch Oschin telescope (P48). Due to weather, our
observations only began on 2017-01-07 UTC. The northern probability island
from the updated LALInference localization (LVC, GCN 20385) was observable
from Palomar for most of the night. Starting at 13:03 UT (2.88 d after the
LIGO trigger), we imaged 85 of the fields two or more times, spanning 622
square degrees. We estimate a 32% prior probability that these fields
contain the true location of the source.

During preliminary sifting through candidate variable sources using image
subtraction by both our IPAC pipeline (Masci et al. 2016) and NERSC
pipeline (Cao et al. 2016), and applying standard iPTF vetting procedures,
we flagged the following optical transient candidates for further follow-up:

Some additional transients not listed above fell just outside the 90%
contour localization contour, e.g. iPTF17cw 135.909904 +43.097300.

Positions are stated in the ICRS. Times are in UTC. Magnitudes are based on
image subtraction; they are in the Mould R filter and in the AB system,
calibrated with respect to point sources in SDSS as described in Ofek et
al. 2012.

None of the above transients show prior history of detection in iPTF
archival images. All of the above transients coincide with a galaxy that is
visible in iPTF and/or SDSS images. Archival spectroscopic or photometric
redshifts of the transients' likely host galaxies are given above. Of the
transients, those that are most consistent with the directional distance
estimate from LIGO (e.g., |[galaxy distance] - [GW mean distance]| < 1.5 *
[GW distance std.
dev.]) are iPTF17ce, iPTF17ck, iPTF17dz, iPTF17ef, and iPTF17ei.

We encourage spectroscopic classification of these candidates.
