A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), A. Gomboc,
J. Japelj (U. Ljubljana), C.G. Mundell (LJMU) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North robotically followed up GRB130427A
(SWIFT trigger 554620,  Maselli et al. GCN 14448 ) starting 4.3 min
after the GRB trigger time. We detect a bright fading source
at the position reported by Elenin et al. (GCN 14450), Perley
(GCN 14451) with R ~11.5 mag.

We note also a faint, 21-mag, underlying source visible in SDSS
images that may suggest this GRB is nearby with a bright host galaxy.

Observations are ongoing.
