of the Swift Team:

At 09:34:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081104 (trigger=333666).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 100.485, -54.732 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 41m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 43' 55"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multiple peaked
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~10 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+40.5 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. M. Parsons (parsons AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
