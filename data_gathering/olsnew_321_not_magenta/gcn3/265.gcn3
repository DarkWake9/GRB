TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  265
SUBJECT: BATSE Resumes Normal Operations

Chip Meegan and the BATSE team (MSFC) report:

Yesterday's anomaly (GCN 264) has now been repaired.  As expected,
it was caused by a single event upset in the area of the program
that calculates the average background rate.  The symptoms are consistent
with the error.  Only the burst triggers, the average rates and
trigger thresholds in the HER auxiliary data are invalid.  The time interval
when the memory was corrupted is 99/02/22 06:56:26 to 99/02/23 13:3108 UT.
All triggers during this interval are invalid.

Normal BATSE operations have resumed and all triggers are valid and suitable
for resumed burst follow-up activities.
