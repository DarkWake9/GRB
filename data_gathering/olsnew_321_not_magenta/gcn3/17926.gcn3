M.G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) and A. Melandri 
(INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

A second epoch of XRT data was collected on the field of the MAXI-detected
burst: GRB 150608A (Arimoto, et al., GCN Circ. 17912) on 2015 June 13.
The observations consist of 2 ks of PC mode data, from T0+389 ks to 
T0+395 ks.

The X-ray source reported in GCN Circ. 17917, Bernardini et al., 
measured at
a mean count rate of 8.3e-01 count/sec (0.3-10 keV) in the first epoch 
of XRT
observations has faded to a mean count rate of (7.1e-03+/-2.2e-03) 
count/sec
(0.3-10 keV) in the second epoch. Assuming a power-law decay, the 
corresponding
decay index is alpha=1.28 (-0.11, +0.17).  We therefore confirm that 
this is
the X-ray afterglow of GRB 150608A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
