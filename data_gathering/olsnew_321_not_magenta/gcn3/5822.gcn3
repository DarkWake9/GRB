A. C. Updike, B. C. Donehew, and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University)
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

Using the Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope and FLAMINGOS NIR imaging and
spectroscopy instrument, we imaged the field of GRB 060605.  Under fair
conditions, we integrated for two hours in the J band.  At the location of
the optical afterglow (GCN 5222), we do not detect the host galaxy to a
limiting magnitude of 17.4.
