report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:48:51.23 UT on 2 December 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 191202A (trigger 597012536 / 191202867)
which was also detected by the Fermi-LAT.
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 12
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 30.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.0 s to T0+18.4 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 190 +/- 19 keV,
alpha = -1.20 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.05 +/- 0.08.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.95 +/- 0.04)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 23.5 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
