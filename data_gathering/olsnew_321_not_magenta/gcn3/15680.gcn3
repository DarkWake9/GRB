D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 131231A (Sonbas et al., GCN 15640; Jenke 
and Xiong, GCN 15644) with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter 
Astronomy between 2013-01-01 23:54:54 UT and 2013-01-02 02:02:17 UT 
(1.798-1.887 days post-GRB) at a mean frequency of ~93 GHz, under good 
conditions.

We identify a weak source consistent with the optical localization (Xu 
et al., GCN 15651; Singer et al., GCN 15643) in the reduced map.  The 
afterglow flux at this time is measured to be 0.85 +/- 0.25 mJy.

We thank observers B. A. Zauderer and M. Balokovic and the CARMA staff 
for executing the observation.
