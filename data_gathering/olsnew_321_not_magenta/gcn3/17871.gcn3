The observation of high-energy emission from GRB 150513A by Fermi-LAT
[1] clearly points to a binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) nature of the
source [2], in spite of the missing follow-up from Swift/XRT and UVOT
due to a Sun observing constraint which will last until the 28th of May
[3].

BdHNe have a standard behavior in the late X-ray luminosity [4,5,6],
thus we expect the X-ray emission of GRB 150513A to follow such a
behavior as well.

Assuming that the X-ray luminosity of GRB 150513A is comparable with
the BdHN prototypical one of GRB 090618 (GRB 130427A), a detection by
Swift/XRT of GRB 150513A on the 28th of May implies an upper limit for
its redshift z<0.8 (z<2).

Therefore, we strongly encourage observation by Swift/XRT of GRB
150513A from the 28th of May on. This would give a fundamental
information on the nature of this source, despite the absence of data
between May 13th and May 28th.
