"We have observed the error box of GRB 001025A (Hurley et al., GCN
#863, #864) with 8 x 300s R band exposures with the 60-cm RC telescope
at Ouda station starting Oct. 26.79 UT.  Due to the bad weather, the
limiting magnitude was mag about 18.0.  Comparing with Digital Sky
Survey 2nd generation R image, no new object has not detected within
the error box.  Further observation is planned to be carried out
tonight."
