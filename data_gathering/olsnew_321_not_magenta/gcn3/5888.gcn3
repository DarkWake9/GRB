TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  5888
SUBJECT: GRB061202: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits
DATE:    06/12/02 17:06:00 GMT
FROM:    Frank Marshall at GSFC  <marshall@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov>

F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:
 
The Swift/UVOT began its first finding chart exposure of the field of  
GRB 061202 129 seconds after the BAT trigger (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 5886).
No afterglow candidate is detected in the XRT error circle reported by 
Sakamoto et al. in this or any of the other early UVOT exposures.
 
The initial photometry upper limits for each UVOT filter are given 
below where Tmid is the average time of the exposure, in seconds,
since the BAT trigger and Mag_3 is the 3-sigma
upper limit for the magnitude. The quoted errors do not 
include the 0.1 mag systematic uncertainty in the photometric zero points.
