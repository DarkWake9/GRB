Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150212A (trigger #630876)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 17449).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 285.497, 47.389 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 01m 59.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +47d 23' 19.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 71%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve is FRED peak starting at ~T-1 sec, peaking
at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+25 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 11.4 +- 4.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.20 to T+19.66 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.50 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.9 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
