Team:

"At 15:05:15.72 UT on 30 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 081130 (trigger 249750316 / 081130.629).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 14.1, Dec = +4.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 0h 56m,
+4d 10'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma
containment, statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error
which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a spike of ~12 seconds and a possible precursor
at ~T0-28 seconds. The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.8s to T0+7.4s is
best fit by a power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power-law index is -0.77 +/- 0.12 and the cutoff energy, parameterized
as Epeak, is 152 +/- 17 keV. The fluence (50-300 keV) in this time
interval is (1.3 +/- 0.1)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.3s in the 50-300 keV band is 1.8 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
