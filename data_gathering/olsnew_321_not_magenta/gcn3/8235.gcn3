S. McBreen, E. Bissaldi and A. von Kienlin (MPE) report on
behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:38:55 UT on 12 September 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 080912 (trigger 242901536 / 080912360).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM
trigger data, is RA = 26.1, Dec = -5.1 (J2000 degrees)
(equivalent to J2000 01h 44m, -05d 06'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 8.4 degrees (radius, 1-sigma
containment; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the
Fermi LAT boresight is 56 degrees.

This GRB consists of one main pulse starting at T0-3 with a
T90 (50-300 keV) of about 17 s. The  time-averaged
spectrum in this interval is adequately fit  by a
powerlaw function with index -1.74 +/-0.07.

The fluence (25-1000 keV) is 3.3 (+/-0.1)E-06 erg/cm2.
The peak flux (25-1000 keV) on the 64 ms timescale
is 4.1 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
the final results will be published in the Fermi GBM GRB Catalog."
