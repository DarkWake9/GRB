Odyssey GRB teams,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin, on
behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

This burst was observed by Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (GRS), and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) at 28275 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  10
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  7.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary, 3 sigma error
boxes each with approximate area 24000 square arcminutes whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)

                                       OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  19 h  5 m 34.33 s     13 o 47 '   0.40 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 19 h  3 m 38.29 s     13 o 33 '  56.68 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 19 h 25 m 27.01 s     17 o  7 '  58.89 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 18 h 30 m 47.64 s      6 o 30 '  24.53 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 19 h  7 m 27.44 s     13 o 59 '  17.61 " 

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further processing.
These error boxes may be improved.
