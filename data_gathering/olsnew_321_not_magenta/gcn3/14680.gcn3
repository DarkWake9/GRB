TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14680
SUBJECT: GRB 130518A: P60 Afterglow Observations
DATE:    13/05/20 04:03:37 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the location of the Fermi GBM (Xiong et al., GCN 14674),
LAT (Omodei et al., GCN 14675), Swift BAT (Cummings et al., GCN 14676),
and Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN 14677) GRB 130518A with the
robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations were obtained in the r'
and i' filters beginning at 10:24 UT on 2013 May 19 (~ 0.85 d after the
GBM trigger).

We detect the optical afterglow (Evans et al., GCN 14678; Troja et al.,
GCN 14679) in both filters.  Using several nearby point sources from SDSS
for calibration, we measure a magnitude of r' = 19.3 at this time.
