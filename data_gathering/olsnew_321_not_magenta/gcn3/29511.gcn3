A. Lysenko, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 210212B has been detected by
Konus-Wind, in the waiting mode, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and
Swift (BAT), so far, at about 9477 s UT (02:37:57).
The burst was likely outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, error box
whose coordinates are:
   ---------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg     Dec(2000), deg
   ---------------------------------
   Corners:
       159.26         +24.95
       100.54         +38.07
        96.30         +19.08
       163.83         +2.39
   ---------------------------------
This box may be improved.

The optical transient ZTF21aakruew/AT2021cwd (Yao et al., GCN Circ. 
29508) is inside the box, lending support to the association of the 
transient and the burst.

A triangulation map is posted at

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
