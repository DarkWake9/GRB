We reobserved the field of GRB 130327A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14331, 
and Osborne et al., GCN 14335) with the Reionization and Transients 
Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson 
Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro 
Mártir from 2013/03 28.13 to 2013/03 28.14 UTC (25.24 to 25.64 hours 
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.33 hours exposure in the 
r' and i' bands and 0.14 hours of exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

The source identified in our previous RATIR observations within the refined XRT 
error circle (Butler et al. GCN 14334), and detected by Gemini (source #2 
in GCN  14342) has faded below our detection limit. We report the following 
3-sigma limits in the AB magnitude system:

 r'	> 22.67
 i'	> 22.46
 Z	> 20.83
 Y	> 20.47
 J	> 20.07
 H	> 19.99

This fading is consistent with the fading reported by Cucchiara et al. 
(GCN 14342). Based on these observations we confirm that this was the 
optical/NIR afterglow of GRB 130327A.

The second source identified outside the refined XRT error circle in the 
first RATIR observation and detected also by Gemini (as source #1 in GCN 14342) 
has not faded. Therefore it is unrelated to GRB 130327A. 


These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction 
of the GRB.
We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
