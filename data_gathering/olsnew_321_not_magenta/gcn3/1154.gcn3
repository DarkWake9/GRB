TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1154
SUBJECT: GRB011121: continued decay

L. Wyrzykowski (Warsaw University Observatory) and K. Z. Stanek
(Harvard-Smithsonian CfA) report:


Additional R-band observations of the GRB011121 OT carried out with
the OGLE 1.3m telescope indicate continuing fading behavior of the
afterglow (GCNs 1151, 1152):

HJD-2450000         UT           R_c       exp
2236.71036    011123 05:06   20.35+-0.07  3x600 sec

This measurement might be somewhat contaminated by the possible host
galaxy.  Combined with the last night data, this is consistent with a
power-law decay with an index of -1.55, similar to -1.65 obtained from
first night data alone (GCN 1152).  The R-band magnitudes are relative
to star "A" of Wyrzykowski et al. (see finding chart at
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/GRB/).
