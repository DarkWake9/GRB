GRB000926 - Optical observations

The optical counterpart of GRB000926 has been observed using the
CFH12K CCD mosaic camera at the prime focus of the 3.6-m CFH
Telescope.

One 600s exposure with moderate seeing (image quality between 0.9"
and 1.0") has been obtained and a preliminary reduction using
the reference star of Halpern et al. (GCN #806) with R=17.1 gives
the following measurement for GRB000926:

Sept. 29.3075  R = 21.23 +/- 0.05

Added to the R-band data points used in the analysis by Hjorth et al.
(GCN #814), this new point confirms a pure power law decay with
a decay value of 1.69 +/- 0.03, which is not significantly different 
from Hjorth et al.'s determination.

Kocevski, Donovan and G. Luppino are acknowledged for their help in 
this observation.
