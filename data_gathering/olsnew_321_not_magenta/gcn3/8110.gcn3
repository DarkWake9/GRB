report on behalf of the GLAST Burst Monitor Team: 

"At 13:54:24 UT on 2008 Aug 18, the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 080818 (GBM 080818.579 / trigger 240760465).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 55.2, Dec = -5.0 (J2000 degrees) 
(equivalent to J2000 03h 41m, -05d 00') 
with an uncertainty of 8.3 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error 
which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). 
The angle from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) boresight is 68 degrees.

This GRB has a duration of approximately 50 s and contains 2 peaks.
The time averaged spectrum from 10 to 300 keV is well fitted by 
a power-law with index -1.57 +/- 0.05. The fluence of the event is 
2.26E-6 ergs per square cm from 50 to 300 keV.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
