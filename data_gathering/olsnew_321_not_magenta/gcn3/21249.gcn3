We report optical imaging follow-up observations in an error region of 
the possible electromagnetic counterpart of G288732 (GCN 21221) 
discovered with Fermi LAT (Omodei et al. 2017, GCN, 21227). We observed 
the field with 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope and its 2.2 deg x 2.2 deg 
field-of-view camera, Kiso Wide Field Camera (KWFC; Sako et al. 2012, 
SPIE, 8446, 84466L). We took two consecutive 1-sec exposures twice in 
i-band on June 9.483, 9.489, 9.527, and 9.529, 2017 UT, roughly 123 ks 
after the GW detection. The median depth of the images is 15.6 mag (AB, 
5 sigmas). Although there is a 1.5 arcmin gap in Declination because of 
the spatial gap of the CCDs, we covered almost the entire error field of 
the possible Fermi LAT detection. We compared the detected source 
catalogs with the public Pan-STARRS1 catalog (Chambers et al. 2016, 
arXiv:1612.05560) and do not find any new transient sources within the 
Fermi LAT error circle.  All the seven Swift XRT sources reported
in Evans et al. (2017, GCN 21233) were covered by our observations and
the source 7 is detected in our images with almost constant brightness
of i=12.8 mag.

[GCN OPS Note(14jun17): Per author's request, the phase
"were covered by our observations" was added to the last sentence.]
