and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170115B (Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 20463; McEnery et al.,
GCN Circ. 20464; Sharma et al., GCN Circ. 20466; Xiao et al., GCN Circ. 20469;
Verrecchia et al., GCN Circ. 20474; Frederiks et al., GCN Circ. 20476) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 17:49:12.63 on 15 January 2017.
The burst signal was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows several overlapping pulses starting at T0,
peaking at T+3 sec and ending at T+15 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 12.0 +- 0.9 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
