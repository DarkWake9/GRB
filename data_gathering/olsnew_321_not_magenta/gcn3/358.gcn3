including the PLANET Team and the BeppoSAX GRB optical follow-up Team,
report:


"We have observed the error box of GRB990627 (Gandolfi, GCN #356)
with the Sutherland 1.0m telescope (South Africa) in the R band
on June 28.138-28.193, for a total exposure time of 4200 sec.
Comparison of the summed image with the DSS (2nd Epoch Survey of the
UK Schmidt; RG610 filter) does not show evidence of any new source above
the DSS plate limit.

Photometry linked to the USNO-A1.0 star at RA = 01h 48m 15s.61, Dec = -77o
04' 37".1 (J2000), which has R = 15.8, implies a 3-sigma magnitude limit
of R ~ 21 for the sum image.

We have also inspected the positions of the four radio sources found by
Subrahmanyan et al. (GCN #357) in the GRB990627  error box.
No object brighter than our limiting magitude is seen at any of them.
