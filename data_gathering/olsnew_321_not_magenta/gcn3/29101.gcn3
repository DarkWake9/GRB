The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:11:43 UT on 21 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201221B (trigger 630252708.014426 / 201221591).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 110.6, Dec = 32.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 22m, 32d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 14.0 degrees.
