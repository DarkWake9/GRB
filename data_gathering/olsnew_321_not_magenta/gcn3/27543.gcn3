report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:29:02.52 UT on 11 April 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200411A (trigger 608272147 / 200411187),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, GCN 27536)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 116 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 1.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.64 +/- 0.22 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 420 +/- 120 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.7 +/- 0.6)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 11.9 +/- 1.5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
