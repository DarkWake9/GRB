A. Kaur (Clemson U.), A. Delgado-Navarro (Clemson U.), D. Harbeck (WIYN
Observatory), M. Riabokin (NOAO), M. Orio (INAF, UW Madison), D. H.
Hartmann (Clemson U.) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:



We imaged the location of the Swift detected GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al.,
GCN 16142) with the pODI instrument on the 3.5 m WIYN telescope at KPNO (
http://www.wiyn.org/ODI/About/wiynpODI.html).



Observations in the ODI r' band began at 09:40:38 UT on 23 April 2014. We
clearly detect the optical afterglow candidate indicated by Elenin et al.
(GCN 16143) in individual exposures beginning at this time.
