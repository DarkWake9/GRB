We imaged the field of GRB 160401A detected by Integral
(Mereghetti et al. GCNC 19251) with the Zadko robotic
telescope (D=100cm) located at the observatory - Gingin,
Australia.

The observations started 0.63 day after the GRB trigger
as soon as the night became. The elevation of the field
decreased from 27 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures. We did not observed
any new optical source than those in the SDSS in a radius of
2 arcmin centered ont the position RA=05:58:57 Dec=+26:40:33
J2000.0:

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=183.4 lat= +1.4
