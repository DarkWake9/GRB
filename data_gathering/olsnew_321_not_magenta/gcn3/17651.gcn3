We observed the field of GRB 150120B (D'Elia et al., GCN 17314) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station 
of Yunnan Observatory. Observations began from UT 13:42:43.5 20th, Jan., 2015 (about 6.3 hours after the trigger). 
We clearly detected the optical counterpart with brightness of R=22.1+/-0.1 mag.


J. Mao apologizes for this very late GCN circular submission.
