S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Colloboration:

We have imaged the field of Swift trigger 107873 with the automated
Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations began 5 minutes after receiving
the alert, and we have obtained 3 x 120 second exposures in each of the
Kron R and I and Gunn z filters.  A visual comparison with DSS archive
images reveals no new sources in any filter to the DSS limit.

Further observations are planned.
