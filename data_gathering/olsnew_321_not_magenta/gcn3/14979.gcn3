D. A. Perley (Caltech) and M. Kasliwal (Carnegie) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the location of the probable optical counterpart of Fermi 
GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967; Cheung et al., GCN 14971; 
Collazzi & Connaughton, GCN 14972) with the Combined Array for Research 
in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) on 2013-07-04 between 00:28:21 and 
05:56:31 UT, 2.01-2.24 days after the GBM trigger, at a frequency of 93 
GHz (3 mm).  Weather conditions were poor initially but improved 
somewhat over the course of the integration.   In a preliminary 
reduction of the data we detect a millimeter source coincident with the 
location of the optical counterpart with a flux of approximately ~2 mJy.

We thank John Carpenter and the CARMA staff for their support.
