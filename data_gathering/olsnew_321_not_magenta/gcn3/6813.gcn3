K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and J.R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

Additional Swift-XRT observations have been performed of the possible 
X-ray afterglow of GRB 070917 (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 6796). Between 
~3.5e4 and 3.5e5 seconds after the burst, the source has faded following a 
power-law decay slope of alpha = 1.1 +/- 0.3, confirming that it is, 
indeed, the afterglow. Using ~14 ks of data, we find a refined position of 
RA, Dec = 293.91897, 2.41104 degrees, which is equivalent to:

RA(J2000) =  19 35 40.55
Dec(J2000)= +02 24 39.8

with an estimated uncertainty of 6.0 arcsec (radius, 90% containment 
including boresight uncertainty). This source is 0.7" from the optical 
counterpart discussed by Cenko (GCN Circ. 6800) and Fynbo et al. (GCN Circ 
6803).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
