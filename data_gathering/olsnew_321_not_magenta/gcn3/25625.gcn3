M. Axelsson (KTH and Stockholm Univ.), F. Piron (CNRS/IN2P3/LUPM), L. Scotton (University and INFN, Torino), F. Longo (University and INFN, Trieste) and E. Bissaldi (Politecnico and INFN Bari) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration:

We have searched data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Sep 1, 2019, for possible high-energy (E > 100 MeV) gamma-ray emission in spatial/temporal coincidence with the LIGO/Virgo trigger S190901ap (GCN 25606).

We define "instantaneous coverage" as the integral over the region of the LIGO probability map that is within the LAT field of view at a given time, and "cumulative coverage" as the integral of the instantaneous coverage over time. Fermi-LAT had instantaneous coverage of 37% of the LIGO probability region at the time of the trigger (T0 = 2019-09-01 23:31:01.838 UTC), and reached 98% cumulative coverage after ~5 ks. The remaining area was not observed within 10 ks following the trigger time of the event.

We performed a search for a transient counterpart within the observed region of the 90% contour of the LIGO map in a fixed time window from T0 to T0 + 10 ks. No significant sources were found.

We also performed a search which adapted the time interval of the analysis to the exposure of each region of the sky, and no additional excesses were found.

Energy flux upper bounds for the fixed time interval between 100 MeV and 1 GeV for this search vary between 5E-08 and 3E-07 [erg/cm^2/s].

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this event is Lorenzo Scotton (lorenzo.scotton@to.infn.it<mailto:lorenzo.scotton@to.infn.it>).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
