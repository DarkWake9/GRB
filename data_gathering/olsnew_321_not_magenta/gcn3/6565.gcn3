D. Malesani, C.C. Thoene, J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), N.R. Tanvir (Univ. 
Leicester), A. Tziamtzis (NOT), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 070621 (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 6530) with 
the NOT equipped with ALFOSC. Observations were carried out in the R and 
I bands, for a total of 15 min per filter, at mean times 22.17 and 
22.184 UT (4.84 and 5.12 hr after the GRB, respectively).

At the edge of the XRT error circle, there is an object at the 
coordinates (J2000, 0.5" uncertainty):
 RA = 21:35:10.07
 Dec = -24:49:07.7
with R~22.3 calibrated with respect to the USNO-B1 star 0651-0871887. It 
might be extended, although the low S/N does not allow firm statements.

No other objects are detected inside the XRT error circle down to R~23.4 
and I~22.5.
