O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:05:17.49 UT on the 5th of December 2014, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 141205A
(trigger 439459520 / 141205337 ), which was also detected by
Swift (Cummings et al. 2014, GCN 17137). The GBM on-ground
location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent
with the Swift location.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 123 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak with a duration
(T90) of about 1.5 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum
from T0-0.26 s to T0+1.3 s is adequately fit by a power law
function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law
index is -0.23 +/- 0.39  and the cutoff energy, parameterized
as Epeak, is 525 +/- 164 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.1 +/- 0.2)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
