E. Berger and D. Murphy (Carnegie) report:

"We also obtained a 360 sec I-band image of the position of GRB 070802 
(GCN 6692) starting on 2007 August 2, 08:02:19 UT.  Within the XRT error 
circle we detect a faint source with I~21.5 mag located at:
 	RA = 02:27:35.88
 	DEC = -55:31:39.3
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  If this is the 
afterglow of GRB 070802 the earlier non-detection in R-band may indicate 
a redshift z~4.5-6, or a highly reddened GRB at a lower redshift."
