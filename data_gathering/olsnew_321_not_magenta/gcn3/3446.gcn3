TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3446
SUBJECT: XRF 050522 detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/05/22 06:54:59 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck
(ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS
Localization Team report:

A 15 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data in the 
15-40 keV band at 06:00:21 on May 22 2005. It is not detected above 40 
keV, which classifies it as an XRF.

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  200.1468 [degrees]
DEC: +24.7916 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.34 
ph (2.2E-08 erg)/cmsq/s. Its fluence (20-200 keV, 80 s integration time) 
is 1.7 ph (9E-08 erg)/cmsq.

A plot of the double peaked light curve will be posted at

Note that this burst is located at high galactic latitude (b=+83 deg) and 
not affected by Galactic absorption. It is therefore a good target for 
optical follow-up searches.
