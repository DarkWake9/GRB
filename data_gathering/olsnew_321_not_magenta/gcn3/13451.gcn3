We observed GRB120711A (GCN 13434) with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array at 34GHz for 26 minutes centered on 21:37UT Jul 11 2012
(T0+18.9hours) in stormy weather.

We detect no radio source at the location of the GRB (GCN 13430) and
place an upper limit of 3.6mJy on the flux of an afterglow.

Further observations are planned.

These observations were obtained as part of ATCA project C2689. We
thank the observatory staff for their support and scheduling the
observations. The Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of
Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
