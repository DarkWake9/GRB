The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:23:25 UT on 4 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201104C (trigger 626210610.205754 / 201104808).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 240.3, Dec = -36.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 01m, -36d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.

[GCN OPS NOTE(06Nov20): Due to the uncertainty of the arrival time with respect 
to the downtime window (15 hours) of the GCN Circulars processing system, 
the error in the date-time in the header of this Circular can be off anywhere from 0-15 hours.]
