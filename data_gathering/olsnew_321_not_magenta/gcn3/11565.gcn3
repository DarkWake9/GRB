SUBJECT: GRB 110107A: Swift-XRT afterglow confirmation

G. Stratta (ASDC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift performed a second target of opportunity observation of GRB 110107A on
January 12, 2011.

The XRT began observing the field at 2011-01-12 18:07:47 UT, that is T+420.7
ks (4.87 days) (Cummings, GCN Circ. 11545).
Using 2.1 ks of Photon Counting mode data we find that the source has faded
down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 0.007 counts/s.
Assuming a power law decay starting from the first source detection (Stratta
et al., GCN Circ. 11547), the upper limit
is consistent with a decay index steeper than alpha = -0.4.

The fading nature of the source confirms its afterglow origin.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
