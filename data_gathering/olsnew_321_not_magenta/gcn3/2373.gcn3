M.C. Nysewander, J.C. Clemens, J.A. Moran and D.E. Reichart (University of
North Carolina) report:

Upon further inspection of the images of the candidate reported by Moran et
al., GCN 2363, we find that the transient was the product of faulty
hardware.  Our new camera had not been fully tested by the time of the
burst alert, and below spec CTE problems seemed to have caused the
fading/variable source apparent in the images.  We apologize for any
confusion.
