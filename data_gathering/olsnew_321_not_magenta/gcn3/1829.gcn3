SPI-ACS team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Konus and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this event at 63374 s.
Its duration was ~ 150 ms.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)=97.625, +30.625 degrees, whose
radius is 33.559 +/- 2.447 degrees.  The Konus ecliptic latitude
response constrains the arrival direction to those portions
of the annulus between RA, Dec=55, +36 and 79, +59 degrees, and
between RA, Dec = 134, +34 and 121, +57 degrees.  As the annulus
does not include any of the known SGRs, but does cross the
Galactic plane, this event is likely, although not certain, to
be a short/hard GRB.

Further improvements to this localization are possible, but a small
error box cannot be obtained for this event.
