MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB131225A 6 hours after trigger 
time at 2013-12-25 15:53:40 UT.
We cover full MAXI error box (A. Kawagoe et al GCN 15609) using MASTER II 
twin telescope in parallel mode with FOV 4 sq. degrees.
Observations were made in the extremely  rich field (with galactic 
latitude b=-4 deg).
The  5-sigma upper limit has been about 19.0 mag on our first (180s 
exposure) image. On coadd of first 19 images with total exposure 3420 sec 
and middle time 2013-12-25 16:30:25 UT the  5-sigma upper limit has been 
20.5 mag.

Inside MAXI field of view we have detected two objects not present in
USNO-B1.0 catalog with the following coordinates and unfiltered
magnitudes:

ID #1191735: 06 19 43.71 +04 47 37.6  (20.13m)
ID #1191736: 06 17 51.08 +04 57 19.8  (20.26m)

We have identified both objects with the red stars on the digitized
Palomar IR plates, as well as in WISE and UKIDSS catalogs.

WISE J061943.55+044738.8 (W1=14.33 W2=14.14)
UGPS J061943.55+044739.1 (J=15.42 H=14.88 K=14.47)

WISE J061751.09+045719.6 (W1=15.79 W2=15.46)
UGPS J061751.05+045719.7 (J=18.24 H=17.40 K=17.17)

Also, in error box we found 2 known minor planets (Groom and 2004 OZ). The 
total number of known asteroids in our FOV is 11. There is no new minor 
planet found in error box.
