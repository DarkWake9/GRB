The long-duration GRB 160530B (Fermi-GBM trigger #486316875; Konus-Wind trigger time on 
16:01:13.14 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 16:01:14.40 on 
30 May 2016.  No real time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because 
the real time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal) between 15:48 and 16:04.  
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows bright structure overlaid with multiple spikes.  The emission 
starts at T0-4 sec and ends at T0+16 sec.  The multiple spikes peak at T0+2 sec, T0+3 sec 
and T0+5 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 7.6 +- 0.3 sec (40-450 keV).  
The light curve is available at

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
