"The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely Short GRB.

At 22:25:25 UT on 6 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200306B (trigger 605226330.32671 / 200306934). The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 349.5, Dec = 5.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 18m, 5d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 28.0 degrees. The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 85.0 degrees.
