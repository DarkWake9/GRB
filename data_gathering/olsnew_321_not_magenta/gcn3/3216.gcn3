A. Monfardini, I. Steele, C.G. Mundell C. Guidorzi, A. Gomboc, M. Bode
(Liverpool), N. Tanvir (Hertfordshire), P. O'Brien and E. Rol 
(Leicester) report:
                                                                                
"Since 4.3 hours after the burst, we are monitoring the field of the
GRB050408 (HETE GCN 3189) with the 2m telescopes of the ROBONET network.
                                                                                
We clearly detect the fading afterglow at the position suggested by
A. de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN3192) and then refined in subsequent
GCNs. We also detect the SDSS galaxy quoted by Lamb et al. (GCN3212) about
8arcsec from the afterglow position and conclude that this is VERY
unlikely the GRB050408 host galaxy.
