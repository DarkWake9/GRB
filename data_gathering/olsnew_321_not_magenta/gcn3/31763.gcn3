The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:48:30 UT on 17 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220317A (trigger 669214115.664266 / 220317534).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 172.0, Dec = -11.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 28m, -11d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
