SUBJECT: GRB 060110: MARGE observations

H. Swan (U Mich), I. Smith (Rice), C. Akerlof (U Mich), S. Yost (U  
Mich), and M. Skinner (Boeing) report on behalf of the MARGE  
collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS telescope, located at the  
Maui Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, observed the fading  
counterpart to GRB060110 (Swift trigger 176702 (GCN 4463)). The  
images are unfiltered, 10s exposures which started at 08:05:19.18 UT  
(~5 minutes after the trigger) and ended at 09:37:53.68.  Because the  
FoV of the ABC is 6 arc-minutes across, and because the OT was  
located outside of the BAT error box, the first image containing the  
OT occurred at 09:06:50.

After a comparison of our images with the USNO B 2.0 R catalog, we  
see the OT found by Bloom (GCN 4471). A preliminary analysis gives an R
magnitude of approximately 19.0 at 09:20:58.48 UT. Combined with the  
detection reported by ROTSE-III (GCN 4472), we find a power law decay
with an exponent, alpha, of about 0.7.
