TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  9911
SUBJECT: GRB 090827: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow 
DATE:    09/09/14 13:16:35 GMT

P.A. Evans, K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and S.R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) report on 
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift reobserved the field of GRB 090827 (Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 9846) 
on 2009 September 9th and 13th, 13 and 17 days after the trigger, 
respectively. The XRT gathered 14 ks of Photon Counting mode data in this 
time.

The source reported by Evans & Oates (GCN Circ. 9847) is not detected,
with a 3-sigma upper limit of 8.6 x 10^-4 count s^-1, significantly below
the level of the previous detection. We thus conclude that this source
was the afterglow of GRB 090827.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
