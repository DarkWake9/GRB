The AMI Large Array triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 170710B (Palmer 
et al., GCN 21316) as part of the 4pisky program, and subsequent follow 
up observations were obtained up to 10 days post-burst. Our observations 
at 15 GHz on 2016 Jul 12.3, Jul 13.26, Jul 15.29 and Jul 19.23 (UT) do 
not reveal any radio source at the BAT location (Palmer et al., GCN 
21316), with 3sigma upper limits of 153 uJy, 93 uJy, 93 uJy and 222 uJy 
respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
