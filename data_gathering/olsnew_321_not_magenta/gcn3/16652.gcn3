Using the data set from T-240 to T+902 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140730A (trigger #607742)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 16642).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 56.350, -66.580 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  03h 45m 24.0s
  Dec(J2000) = -66d 34' 48.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses. The first major
pulse starts at ~T-14s, peaks at  ~T-13 s, and ends at ~T-4 s. The second major pulse
starts at ~T+0 s, peaks at ~T+1s, and ends at ~T+5 s. The whole burst structure ends
at ~T+41 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 41.3 +- 3.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.5 to T+29.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.50 +- 0.32.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.17 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
