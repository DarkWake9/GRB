These two bursts were detected by the IPN at 40412 s 40588 s.
Their localizations are consistent with a common origin, although
given the uncertainties, this may be due to chance.

The first event was observed by INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and HETE-FREGATE.  Its
duration was approximately 30 seconds.  We have triangulated it to a
circle centered at RA, Decl (2000)= 260.895, +26.835 degrees, whose
radius is approximately 90 degrees.

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE-FREGATE  observed the second
event.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 40
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2E-05 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  8.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 172.201, +41.659 degrees, whose radius is 63.183 +/-  0.044
degrees (3 sigma ).

These localizations can be improved and/or constrained, but it is not
known at this point whether small error boxes can be derived for these
events.
