The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:43:03 UT on 24 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220724A (trigger 680398988.456506 / 220724988).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 238.5, Dec = -19.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 54m, -19d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
