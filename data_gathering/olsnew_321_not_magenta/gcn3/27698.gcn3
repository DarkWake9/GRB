S. Gupta, V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (IUCAA/TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the weak detection of a long GRB 200506A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #27690).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-05-06 00:28:53.176 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 143 +/- 20 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1364 +/- 27 cts. The local mean background count rate was 538 +/- 1.0 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 26.09 +/- 0.08 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
