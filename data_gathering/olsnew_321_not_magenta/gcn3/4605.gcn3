G. Greco, C. Bartolini, A. Guarnieri, A. Piccioni (Bologna University), G. Pizzichini (INAF IASF Bologna), R. Silvotti (INAF Napoli), D. Nanni, F. Terra (Second University of Rome "Tor Vergata") and I. Bruni (INAF Bologna)   report:

On January 25, 2006 in spite of the unfavorable weather conditions (seeing=3.4 arcsec) we tried to observe the OT of GRB 060124 (Holland et al. GCN 4570; Mangano et al., GCN 4578) with the 152 cm Loiano Telescope and the BFOSC camera system. We obtained three images of 20 min in the Rc filter.   The OT first reported by Kann (GCN 4577) was not detectable in our frames, which have the following limiting magnitudes derived from the USNO-A2.0 catalogue:

      Mean time (UT) 		Mag
		 	
 	22:45:51 	 	18.7 
 	23:53:00 	 	19.2 	 	
 	26:06:48 	 	19.2
 	
The third observation has been posted in our public directory from where it can be retrieved by sftp using hostname: ermione.bo.astro.it, username: publicGRB, password: GRB_bo.
