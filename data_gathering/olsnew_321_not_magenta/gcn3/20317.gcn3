The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161129A (Kocevski et al., GCN 20210) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Nov 29.50, Nov 30.72, Dec 
02.69 and Dec 06.68 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 20211), with 3sigma upper limits of 120 
uJy, 102 uJy, 90 uJy and 117 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
