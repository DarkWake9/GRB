The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 12:45:43 UT on 19 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210619A (trigger 645799548.729736 / 210619532).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 73.9, Dec = 12.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 55m, 12d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 93.0 degrees.
