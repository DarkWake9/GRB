We observed the field of GRB 151127A detected by Swift (trigger #665268; 
D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 18643) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T30 (20" Plane Wave) telescope located at the Siding Spring Observatory (New South 
Wales, Australia).  20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter 
starting from November 27 09:47:56 (UT) about 39.1 minutes after the trigger 
and stopped on November 27 10:23:18 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow 
both in the individual images and the stacked image at the enhanced X-ray afterglow 
position (Goad et al., GCN Circ. 18647).  The estimated five sigma upper limit of 
the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec) is ~18.2 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
