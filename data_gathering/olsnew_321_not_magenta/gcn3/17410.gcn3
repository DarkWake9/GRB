Using the data set from T-120 to T+1190 sec from the
recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of
BAT GRB GRB 150203A (trigger #629578) (Ukwatta, et al.,
GCN Circ. 17377).The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 98.394, 6.952 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 33m 34.5s
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 57' 07.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 84%.

BAT light curve shows a single multi-peaked episode starting
around T-2 sec, and ending around T+32 sec. The two main
peaks of the light curve can be seen at T+1 sec and T+18 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 25.8 +- 5.0 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+32.3 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law
index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.90 +- 0.12.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.1 +- 0.6 x 10^-07
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+16.79
sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
