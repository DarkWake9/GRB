At 20:20:57 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB041224.  The spacecraft did not autonomously slew
to the burst since automated slewing was not yet enabled.

The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 56.200,-6.656 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 7 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including our
preliminary bore sight alignment correction).  This is 40 degrees off
the BAT bore sight (33% partially encoded).  The lightcurve is
multi-peaked with a total duration of ~50 sec in the 15-350 keV band.
The burst is soft with a power-law photon index of ~1.7-1.8.
