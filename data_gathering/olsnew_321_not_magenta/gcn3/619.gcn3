D. A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the short-duration burst GRB 000326 (GCN #618) with the
VLA at a frequency of 4.86 GHz, starting on March 27.70 UT. Three
separate pointings were required to image the IPN error box. With an
rms noise level of 62 microJy, we identify one bright source
(i.e. flux density > 6-sigma) on the edge of the IPN error box at
(J2000) r.a.= 22 11 22.00, dec. = -26 07 35.2. Two weaker sources are
also seen at r.a.= 22 10 49.55, dec. = -26 10 0.2 and r.a.= 22 10
55.33, dec. = -26 09 51.1. We will continue to monitor this field to
determine which, if any, of the sources are related to GRB 000326."
