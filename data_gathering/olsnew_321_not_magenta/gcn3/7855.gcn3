Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of 
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to re-observe the field of view toward 
INTEGRAL GRB 080603A (GCN 7790) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 June 
07.42 UT. We clearly detect a radio afterglow at KAIT optical afterglow 
position (GCN 7789) at a flux density level of 154 ± 28 uJy.
