SUBJECT: Peculiar Type Ic SN 2003jd (SN/GRB?), optical spectrum

T. Matheson, P. Challis, R. P. Kirshner (CfA) and P. Berlind (FLWO)
report:

We obtained a spectrum (range 370-750 nm) of SN 2003jd (IAUC 8232)
with the F. L. Whipple Obs. 1.5-m telescope and the FAST spectrograph
on Oct 28.32 UT.  The supernova is a peculiar Type Ic and it shows
strong similarities with SN 1998bw near maximum (Patat et al. 2001,
ApJ, 555, 900).  Other peculiar Type Ic SNe (such as SNe 1997ef or
2002ap) do not match up as well with SN 2003jd.  The blue end of the
spectrum is not as consistent with SN 1998bw, highlighting the
heterogeneous nature of these peculiar Ic SNe.  The spectrum and a
comparison with SN 1998bw are available at

Further observations, especially in other wavelengths, are encouraged.

P.S.  This information will appear in an IAU Circular, but has been
reported here for the benefit of those GCN subscribers who do not read
the IAU Circulars.
