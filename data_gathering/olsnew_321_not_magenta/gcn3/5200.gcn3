and G. Sato (GSFC/JSPS/USRA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:54:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060602B (trigger=213190).  Swift slewed immediately 
to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 267.380, -28.109 {17h 49m 31s, -28d 06' 31"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at 7 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 23:55:56 UT, 83 seconds after the BAT
trigger. We find a faint uncatalogued source in the first 246s of
down-linked PC mode data at RA,Dec (J2000) = 17 49 31.7, -28 08 03.7
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcsec (90% containment). This is 92
arcsec from the on-board BAT position. This source is not consistent
with the BOOTES-IR candidate reported in GCN 5198. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 89 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle. The typical
3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. The 8'x8' region for the
list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error
circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. We
note that this is a crowded field and that a large, but uncertain
extinction is expected.
