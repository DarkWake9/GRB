The long-duration GRB 171229A (Konus-Wind trigger time on 09:59:28.212)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 09:59:37.40 on
29 December 2017.  This GRB is also clearly seen by the publicly available
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS light curve.  The burst signal was seen only by the SGM
instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single pulse followed by a weak extended
emission.  The emission starts at T-10 sec, peaks at T0 and ends at T+67 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 70.8 +- 6.9 sec (40-1000 keV).
The T50 duration measured by the SGM data is 38.1 +- 17.7 sec (40-1000 keV).

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
