For GRB 090309 (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 8964), we are unable to determine  
if this is a short or long burst.  The reasons are as follows:  (1) the  
spectral lag is 0.044 +/- 0.16 sec (between the 50-100 and 15-25 keV).   
(2) The T90 duration is 3.0 +- 1.4 sec (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 8967)
which is midway between the two T90 distributions.  (3) The photon index 
is 1.36 +/- 0.33 (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 8967) is also in the middle of 
the short and hard distributions (Figure 13 of Sakamoto et al., ApJS, 175, 179).
