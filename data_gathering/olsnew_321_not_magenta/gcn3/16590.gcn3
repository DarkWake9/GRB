Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:43:45.30 UT on 13 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140713A (trigger 426969828 / 140713780)
which was also detected by Swift (Mangano et al. 2014, GCN 16581).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main overlapping peaks, with a
total duration of about 4.9 s (50-300keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+4.6 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.2 +/- 0.2 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 96 +/- 24 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.2 +/- 0.7)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 3.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
