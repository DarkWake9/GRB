At 01:57:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070611 (trigger=282003). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 1.987, -29.755 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 07m 57s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 45' 18"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data 
products to analyze.  XRT and UVOT will begin observing this target
at 02:50 UT.
