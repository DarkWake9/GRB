E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"On December 12.37 UT we used the VLA at 8.46 GHz to observe the position
of the optical transient (GCN 1731) of GRB 021211 (GCN 1734).  We do not
detect a radio source coincident with the OT down to a 3-sigma limit of
about 70 microJy.  Further observations are planned."
