The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and Virgo Observatory
(V1) around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S190828j
(GCN Circular 25497). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via
GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190828j

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. The 90%
credible region is 228 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1946 +/- 388 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this
alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide <
