The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 17:57:43 UT on 23 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200923A (trigger 622576668.612544 / 200923748).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 126.3, Dec = -54.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 25m, -54d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
