The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:39:24 UT on 27 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191227A (trigger 599103569.720864 / 191227069).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 319.7, Dec = -13.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 18m, -13d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 93.0 degrees.
