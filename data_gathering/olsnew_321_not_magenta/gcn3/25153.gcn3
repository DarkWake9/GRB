We obtained an optical spectrum of the transient AT2019lqm / Gaia19dcs
(discovered by Gaia within the probability map of S190718y; LIGO/Virgo
Collaboration GCN 25087, Kostrzewa-Rutkowska et al. GCN 25145) on 2019 July 25, 04:18
UT using the ACAM instrument mounted on the William Herschel Telescope located on the
Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. The exposure time was 1500 seconds.

Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) we find a good fit to normal
Type Ia supernovae at a redshift of z=0.066, about 1 week after peak.
