E. Berger (Carnegie), D.B. Fox (Penn State), and E. Ofek (Caltech) report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Starting on 2007 April 8.31 UT we used the Gemini Multi-Object 
Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini-North to obtain a spectrum of the bright 
galaxy located in the XRT error circle of the possible afterglow of GRB 
070406 (GCNs 6255,6256,6259).  We detect a narrow [OII] emission line and 
broad H-gamma and H-delta emission features at z=0.703.  The broad H-gamma 
and H-delta lines are indicative of a quasar spectrum, and it is therefore 
likely that the X-ray emission detected with XRT is due to AGN activity 
and not the afterglow of GRB 070406.  Further XRT observations are 
essential to confirm fading versus long-term variability."
