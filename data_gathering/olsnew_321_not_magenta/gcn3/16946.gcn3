Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:27:48.52 UT on 22 October 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 141022A (trigger 141022061 / 141022061)
which was also detected by Swift BAT (Vargas et al. 2014, GCN 16938).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with Swift's location.

The GBM light curve shows a long burst, consisting of one main episode,
with a total duration (T90) of about 11.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.1 s to T0+6.1 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.8 +/- 0.3 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 231.5 +/- 71.1 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.2 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-5.696 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
