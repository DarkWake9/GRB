We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of EM
candidates originally reported in GCNs #20790 and #20801. Observations were
made with the SPRAT spectrograph, and supernova classifications were
obtained using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).


iPTF17bug was observed on 2017-03-03 at 20:19UT. This is a nuclear source,
and the spectrum we obtain seems to be dominated by the host galaxy.

iPTF17bpa was observed on 2017-03-03 at 22:37UT. This source was reported
to be off-centre from it's host galaxy but we do not detect a transient
above the background galaxy emission in our acquisition image. The spectrum
seems to be galaxy dominated.

iPTF17bpt was observed on 2017-03-03 at 23:17UT. We classify this source as
a type Ia Supernova with z=0.074. A type Ib classification is also a
possibility. Note that this classification replaces the classification with
erroneously high z reported in GCN #20809.

iPTF17bsi was observed on 2017-03-04 at 04:56UT. SNID classifies this
source as a Type II supernova (possibly IIP) at 2.7 days after peak with
z=0.028. This is significantly higher than the photometric z = 0.014 reported
for the host galaxy in GCN #20790.

iPTF17btb was observed on 2017-03-04 at 05:29UT. We observe a bright point
source with a featureless spectrum - this is likely a dwarf nova in
outburst.
