We analysed the field of GRB 160203A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 672525) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 10.9h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
23 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were very good.

The first fast analysis (Boer et al. GCNC 18985)
can be now completed by late images. The stack
of images shows the afterglow. Measurements:

Magnitudes are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
