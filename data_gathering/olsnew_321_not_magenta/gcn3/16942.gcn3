Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 141022A (trigger #616061) (Vargas, et al., GCN Circ. 16938).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 241.930, -72.152 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 07m 43.1s
   Dec(J2000) = -72d 09' 06.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 39%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak episode starting
at ~T-1.0 sec, and ending around T+10 sec. The burst location
came into the BAT FOV around ~T-140 sec. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 8.72 +- 1.56 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.38 to T+9.17 sec is best
fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the
time-averaged spectrum is 1.31 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the
15-150 keV band is 4.8 +- 0.7 x 10^-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec
peak photon flux measured from T+6.20 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are
at the 90% confidence level.
