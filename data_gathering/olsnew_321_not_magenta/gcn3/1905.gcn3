TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1905
SUBJECT: GRB 20030226: Upper limits from recent and historical observations 
DATE:    03/02/28 02:01:06 GMT
FROM:    Michael Wood-Vasey at UC Berkeley/LBNL/SNfactory  <wmwood-vasey@lbl.gov>

W. M. Wood-Vasey, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using images
obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks, and K. Lawrence
(Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory),
reports upper limits for previous observations at the location of the
object identified by Price et al. (GCN 1880) as the optical
counterpart to GRB 20030226 from unfiltered observations with the
Oschin 48" telescope at Palomar Observatory.

A co-addition of images from 2003 February 21.53, 21.54, and 21.55
shows no source visible at this location to a limiting unfiltered
magnitude of 21.3 (calibrated to USNO R-band stars on the image frame)
at a S/N of 3.

A co-addition of 9 images from 2002 March 31, 2003 January 19, 
and 2003 February 21 shows no source visible at this location 
to a limiting unfiltered magnitude of 21.6 (calibrated to USNO
R-band stars on the image frame) at a S/N of 3.

The full co-added of all 9 images is available at
