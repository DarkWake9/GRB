SUBJECT: GRB 161214A: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
J.G.Victor (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a long gamma ray burst has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 
4:46:07 UT of 2016 December 14

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.= 190.757 deg
DEC.=  6.853 deg
with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had an initial peak lasting about 7 s with peak flux of about 
0.3 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and fluence of 1.5e-7 
erg/cmq, followed by fainter emission lasting about one minute.

The relatively low significance of the trigger was due to the fact that 
one of the eight modules composing the ISGRI detector was temporarily off 
during the burst.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
