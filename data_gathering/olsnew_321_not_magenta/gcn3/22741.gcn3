The AGILE Mini-CALorimeter (MCAL) detected a burst at T0 = 2018-05-29
08:29:14.72 +/- 0.01 s (UTC), lasting about ~ 1.9 s. The burst was detected
following a possible associated single-peak brief precursor, occurring
about 2 s before, at T0 = 2018-05-29 08:29:12.58 +/- 0.01 s (UTC) and
lasting ~ 4 ms. The light curve of the main burst is composed of several
peaks and released a total of ~2200 counts at E> 400 keV in the detector,
above an average background rate of 23 counts / 32 ms.

Further analysis is still in progress.

The AGILE-MCAL detector has a full solid angle acceptance, and is
operational in the range 0.4 - 100 MeV.
