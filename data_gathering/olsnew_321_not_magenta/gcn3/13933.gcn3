N. Gehrels, S. D. Barthelmy, F. E. Marshall (GSFC):

This is a notification that the Swift Quick-look data at the Swift Data Center and
archival data at the HEASARC are back on line.  They were offline for ~24 hours
(Circ 13923).  The storm has hurricane, and the computers have been re-powered and booted.
There will be some lag in the processing and updating of the data sets and web pages
as the backlog of telemetry data during the outage is processed.
