A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 130122A (Lien et al.;
GCN 14140) beginning 2013 Jan 23.47 (dt=0.48 d) with the
Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy.  At
a mean frequency of 85 GHz with 78 m integration, we do not
detect significant millimeter emission at the Swift/UVOT
position (Breeveld et al.; GCN 14149) to a 3-sigma limit
of ~0.9 mJy.

We thank the CARMA observatory staff for their support."
