The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report: We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data around the time of the compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidate S190727h (GCN 25164). Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page: https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190727h LALInference.fits.gz is the preferred sky map at this time. The 90% credible region is 151 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 2839 +/- 655 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation). For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide <https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/>. [1] Veitch et al.
