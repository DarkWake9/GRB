Christina C. Thoene,  Kim Nilsson, Brian L. Jensen, Johan Fynbo (Dark
Cosmology Centre) report

We observed the BAT error circle of GRB060424 (GCN 5000) in I with the NOT
and ALFOSC on La Palma, starting at UT 05:03:40 at very high airmass.
Inside the BAT revised error circle (GCN 5001) we detect a new source at
the position (J2000)

RA = 00:29:25.8
Dec =+36:47:58.7

The preliminary I magnitude obtained from 5x300s stacked images with a
mean time of about 1h after the burst is

I = 19.1
(compared to a nearby USNO star)

The source is not visible in observations obtained the following night and
therefore likely to be the afterglow of GRB060424

A finding chart will be available soon at:
