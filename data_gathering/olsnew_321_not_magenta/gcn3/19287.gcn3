Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160410A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 682269) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 28s after the GRB trigger
(16.8s after the notice). Due to a technical problem
only the first exposure of 60s was taken.

The image is trailed (see the description in Klotz
et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39). We detect the UVOT
optical transcient discovered by Gibson et al. (GCNC 19271).

At the beginning of the trail (t0+28s) the magnitude is
R=18.4 (+/-0.3) and decays to R=18.7 (limiting magnitude)
at t0+46s. Then the OT became too faint to be detected
between t0+46 and t0+88s (Rlim=18.7).

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
