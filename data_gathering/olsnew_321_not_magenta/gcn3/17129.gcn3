D. Xu (DARK/NBI), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 Senior High School, Xinjiang),
Z.-J. Xu (Nanjing Putian Telecommunications Co. Ltd., Jiangsu) report:

We observed the field of GRB 141130A (Vargas et al., GCN  17120) with
the 36cm robotic telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China.
Observations started at 23:12:44 UT on 2014-10-30, i.e., 108 s after
the burst, and subsequently 4x40s, 8x60s, and 10x90s R-band images
were obtained under some floating clouds.

The optical afterglow, at the UVOT position, is clearly detected in
the stacked 4x40s image, with R=17.67+/-0.20 mag at a median time of
201 s post-burst, against the same four SDSS stars in Xu et al. (GCN
17122). The afterglow is not detected any more in the subsequent
images down a limit of R~18 mag. This is consistent with the
measurement of R~18.5 mag at 258 s after post-burst in Mazaeva et al.
(GCN 17121).
