report:

The 25cm robotic telescope FRAM-ORM at La Palma (Spain)
reacted robotically to the alert of GRB190613A (Ambrosi et al,
GCNC 24798), starting with a series of 20 s unfiltered images
at 04:10:11 UT, i.e. 3 min post trigger.

We clearly detect the source reported by (Ambrosi et al, GCN
24798; Zheng & Filipenko, GCN 24801 and Lipunov et al, GCN
24803), decaying at a rate of alpha ~ 1.51. The brightnes of
the object was R = 18.2 +- 0.2 at an image centered at 04:25:15
UT, i.e. 18 min post burst.
