D. Malesani, J.P.U. Fynbo, P.M. Vreeswijk (DARK) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 070802 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 6692) with 
the ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Inside the XRT error circle, we detect 
the object reported by Berger & Murphy (GCN 6695) and possibly Greiner 
et al. (GCN 6694), at the coordinates

RA = 02:27:35.72
Dec = -55:31:39.01

The object is detected in the V, R, and I bands. No clear fading 
behaviour is detected between exposures taken at 8:01 UT and 8:13 UT.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff, in particular Alain 
Smette.
