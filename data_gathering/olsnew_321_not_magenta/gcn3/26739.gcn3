A. Goldstein (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team and the
GBM-LIGO/Virgo group:

For S200114f and using the latest cWB skymap, Fermi-GBM was observing 100%
of the localization probability at event time.

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
LIGO/Virgo detection of GW trigger S200114f (GCN Circ. 26734). An
automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard
triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no counterpart
candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive, coherent search
for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around merger time, and also
identified no counterpart candidates.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission for the LVC
localization region at merger time. Using the representative soft, normal,
and hard GRB-like templates described in arXiv:1612.02395, we set the
following 3 sigma flux upper limits over 10-1000 keV, weighted by GW
localization probability (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):
