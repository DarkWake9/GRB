J. S. Bloom, D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) and D. L. Starr (UC Berkeley,  
LCOGT) report:

"We observed the field of the optical transient (Schaefer et al. GCN  
6948) of GRB 071020A (Holland et al. GCN 6949) with the 1.3m PAIRITEL  
on Mt. Hopkins starting at 2007-10-20 09:18 UT (~2h16m after the GRB,  
once the field was within telescope limits). In a stack of 2190 sec  
total integration time (mean time = 2007-10-20 09:46 UT), we detect  
the source in the J-band at position:

      ra= 07:58:39.78 dec = +32:51:40.4

(J2000; rms uncertainty relative to 2MASS of 250 mas in each  
coordinate) with J=19.06 +/- 0.23 mag and H=18.71 +/- 0.30 (only  
marginally detected). The source appears to have faded in subsequent  
imaging."
