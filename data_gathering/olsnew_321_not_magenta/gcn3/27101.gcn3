The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:32:34 UT on 16 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200216B (trigger 603552759.75478 / 200216564).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 159.2, Dec = 21.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 36m, 21d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 78.0 degrees.
