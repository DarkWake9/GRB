report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing the long bright burst GRB 050915B (Falcone 
et al., GCN 3987) at 21:25:20 UT, but was unable to obtain an on-board 
centroid.  Analysis of the initial ground-processed data finds a bright, 
fading, and uncataloged source at coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 14:36:26.5
Dec(J2000) = -67:24:36.5

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds (90% containment). This
position lies 56 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3987.
