on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 220211A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 31570;
Swift/BAT-GUANO detection: Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circ. 31582)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 666234473), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 4069 s UT (01:07:49).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
 ---------------------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
 ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   208.379 (13h 53m 31s) +37.218 (+37d 13' 05")
  Corners:
   209.472 (13h 57m 53s) +52.187 (+52d 11' 14")
   209.036 (13h 56m 09s) +51.894 (+51d 53' 39")
   206.213 (13h 44m 51s) +22.653 (+22d 39' 12")
   206.450 (13h 45m 48s) +22.322 (+22d 19' 18")
 ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 8 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 29.6 deg (the minimum one is 16.1 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 116 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi GBM Final Real-time position (GCN Circ. 31570) and BALROG
(https://grb.mpe.mpg.de/grb/GRB220211047/) localizations.

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
