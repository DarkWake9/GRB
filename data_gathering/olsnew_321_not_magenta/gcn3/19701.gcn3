and the CALET collaboration:

The short-duration GRB 160709A (Guiriec, et al., GCN circ. 19675; 
Jenke, et al., GCN circ. 19676; Frederiks, et al. GCN circ. 19677) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 19:49:04.67 
on 9 July 2016.  No real time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about 
this trigger because the real time communication from the ISS was 
off (loss of signal) between 19:42 and 20:04. The burst signal was 
seen by all CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a single starting at T-0.2 sec, 
peaking at T0-0.1 sec and ending at T+0.2 sec.  The T90 duration 
measured by the SGM data is 0.38 +- 0.04 sec (600-3000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda 
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
