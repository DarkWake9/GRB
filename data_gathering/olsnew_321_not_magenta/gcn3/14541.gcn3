TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 130502B: P60 Observations

S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), D. A. Perley, and L. P. Singer (Caltech) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of the Fermi GBM (Von Kienlin et al., GCN 14530) and
LAT (Kocevski et al., GCN 14532) GRB130502B with the robotic Palomar 60
inch telescope.  Observations began at 03:34 UT on 3 May 2013 (~ 0.82 d
after the GBM trigger) and were obtained under poor seeing conditions.  We
detect no significant emission at the position of the candidate X-ray
afterglow (Melandri et al., GCN 14540).  Using nearby point sources from
the USNO-B1 catalog for reference, we measure an upper limit of r' > 20.4
mag at this time.
