The La Silla-QUEST survey operating the 10-sq-deg QUEST camera on the 1.0m ESO Schmidt at La Silla, Chile searched the following ~250 sq. deg area centered on the lobe of the  ~90% confidence area of LVC event G19457 near at 1 h RA.

RA 0.3 to 1.4 h;. Dec -4.5 to + 10.0 deg

One new source (not appearing in deep reference images taken ~1 yr previously) has been detected with high confidence near the center of the LSQ area coverage :

LSQ Desig   V-mag    hh:mm:ss   dd:mm:ss

LSQ15bjb     18.2    00:11:27.60 -06:25:38.28

LSQ15bjb appears 0.2 arcmin north of GALEXASC J001127.51-062549.8. Observations made 2015 Oct 23 and 24 (V mag 18.7 on JD 2457318.64 and 18.2 mag on JD 2457319.63) indicate at rapidly brightening intensity (by factor ~1.5 per day). 

Followup observations are strongly encouraged.
