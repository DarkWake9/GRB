C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140729A (Arimoto and Bissaldi, GCN Circ. 16633)
has been observed by Konus-Wind, Fermi(GBM trigger 428287016),
MESSENGER (GRNS), Swift (BAT), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far,
at about 2214 s UT (00:36:54). The burst was outside the coded
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a GBM-MESSENGER annulus centered at
RA(2000)=115.909 deg (07h 43m 38s)  Dec(2000)=+22.015 deg (+22d 00' 
52"), whose radius is 73.685 +/- 0.219 deg (3 sigma).

This annulus intersects the Fermi-LAT 1 sigma error
circle (GCN 16633) to form an error box whose area is about
(654 sq. arcmin.) which is two times smaller than that
of the LAT error circle.

This localization may be improved.

Details of the Konus-Wind observation will be given in a forthcoming GCN
Circular.
