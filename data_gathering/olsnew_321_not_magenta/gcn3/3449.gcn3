B. L. Gary (Hereford Arizona Observatory [G95]) and A. Price (AAVSO) report
on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy Network on early optical
observations of XRF 050522 (GCN 3446; Gotz et al.):

No afterglow candidate is found in the field compared to DSS to a limiting
unfiltered magnitude of 18.7. Observation midpoint time was 06:38 UT (38
minutes after burst) on May 22, 2005. Details of the observation are below
along with a link to the FITS image.

The AAVSO thanks the Curry Foundation for their continued support of the
