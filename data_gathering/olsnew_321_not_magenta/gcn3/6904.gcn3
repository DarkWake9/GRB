L.P. Xin, M.Zhai, Y.L. Qiu, J.Y. Wei, J.Y. Hu, J.S. Deng,
Y. Urata, and W.K. Zheng on behalf of EAFON report:
 
We have observed GRB 071011 beginning at 12:46:05.3 UT,
353s after the burst with TNT 80cm and EST 1m telescopes
at xinglong Observatory, A series of Whiete, R and V band
images were obtained, preliminary analysis shows the
optical afterglow reported by S. B. Cenko (GCN 6895), faded
continuly. Derived from USNO-A2.0 R magnitude,
We find the early time White band magnitude:
