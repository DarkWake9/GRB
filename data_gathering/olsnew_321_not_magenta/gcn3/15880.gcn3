SUBJECT: GRB 140219A: Retraction of X-ray afterglow
DATE:    14/02/24 09:34:59 GMT

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Further analysis of the XRT afterglow candidate of GRB 140219A (GCN
Circ. 15875) reveals that the light curve of this object had been
contaminated by the presence of a nearby, bright, catalogued X-ray
source. Refined analysis of the previously-announced afterglow candidate 
reveals it to be approximately constant, with a count rate of ~5e-3 
ct/sec, thus it is probably not the afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
