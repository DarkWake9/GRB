S. Poolakil (UAH) and C. Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 09:07:37.12 UT on 14 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200514B (trigger 611140062 / 200514380).
The GBM on-ground location was reported in GCN #27736 and is consistent
with the position triangulated by the IPN (Svinkin et al., 2020, GCN #27755).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 63 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a structured emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 1.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.380 s to T0+0.260 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.06 +/- 0.11 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1700 +/- 900 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.6)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.32 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.1 +/- 0.8 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
