G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 08:12:58.89 UT on 02 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140302A (trigger 415440781/140302342), which was
also
detected by Swift (Pagani et al., GCN 15901). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift/XRT position (Pagani et al., GCN 15901).

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 64 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+64 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.49 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 462 +/- 53 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The main emission is preceded by an apparent precursor event with an
approximate
duration of 20 s. This event has been tentatively associated with the GRB
based on the
location derived by GBM.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
