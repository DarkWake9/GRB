Our RAPTOR-S and RAPTOR-T telescopes began simultaneous multicolor
(clear, V, R, I) imaging of GRB 080310 at UT 08:38:27.14, 28.5 seconds
after the trigger, 6.7 seconds after receiving the trigger.

The counterpart identified by Chornok et al. (GCN 7381) brightened
from below 17 mag to about 16.8 mag at ~200 seconds (clear band
calibrated to USNO B1.0 R2 magnitudes) and dimmed to about 17.3 mag at
400 seconds. We clearly detect the OT simultaneously in all filters
and follow its flux evolution for 1.5 hours.
We observe a broad plateau between 400 and 1100 seconds
with slight rebrightening towards the end of this time interval,
folowed by rapid decay.
