"At 08:25:09.03 UT on 06 July 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180706A (trigger 552558314 / 180706351),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Stamatikos et al. 2018, GCN 22909).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 60 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 38 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-30 s to T0+10 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.98 +/- 0.13 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 53 +/- 4 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.3 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-2 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.9 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
