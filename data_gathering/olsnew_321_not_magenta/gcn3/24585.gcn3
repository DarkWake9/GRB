The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:30:10 UT on 17 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190517A (trigger 579814215.17247 / 190517813).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 270.0, Dec = 25.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 00m, 25d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79.0 degrees.
