M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL), A. Beardmore (Univ. Leicester) report, on behalf
of the Swift team:

The X-ray source described in GCN circ. 14188 (Beardmore et al. 2013) is not
detected anymore in XRT observations performed between 33 and 550 ks after
the trigger, for a total of 35.2 ks of integration time. The 3 sigma upper limit is
0.00089 count/s, appreciably lower than the count rate observed in previous
observations.

Because of the fading behaviour of this source, we conclude it was likely
the X-ray afterglow of GRB130206A.

We also note that successive analysis of late data has reduced the error circle
radius of the source to 4.6'' (90% confidence level).
