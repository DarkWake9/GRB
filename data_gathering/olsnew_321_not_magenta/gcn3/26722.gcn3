behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200112r at T0 = 2020-01-12 15:58:38
(UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered
data found no event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 s
from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 70% of the S200112r 90 % c.l. localization region (LR) was
accessible to the AGILE/MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained
for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the
accessible S200112r LR, from a minimum of 1.42E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum
of 7.90E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with
photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
