We report the detection of radio emission from the fast and red optical
transient AT2022cmc (ZTF22aaajecp; Andreoni et al. 2020, GCN 31590).

We observed the field of AT 2022cmc with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager â€“
Large Array (AMI-LA) for 4 hours on the 2022-02-26, with a central
frequency of 15.5 GHz. A point source is detected in the AMI-LA image at RA
= 13:34:43.28 Dec = +33:13:02.43, consistent with the reported position of
AT2022cmc. The source is detected at a flux density of ~0.5 mJy.

We plan to perform follow-up observations with the AMI-LA, and encourage
further high cadence multi frequency radio observations with other
facilities.

We thank the staff of MRAO for scheduling and performing this observation.
