SUBJECT: GRB 151027A: SAO RAS and Mt. Terskol observations
DATE:    15/11/18 12:41:05 GMT
FROM:    Moskvitin Alexander at SAO RAS  <mosk@sao.ru>

A. S. Moskvitin (SAO RAS), I. V. Sokolov (Terskol Branch of INASAN)
report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up team.

We observed the field of GRB 151027A twice: with 2-m Zeiss-2000
+ FLI CCD (Mt. Terskol) and 1-m Zeiss-1000 + EEV 42-40 CCD (SAO RAS)
on November 6 and 12 respectively (T-T0 = 10.5 and 16.5 days).

We have obtained 10x300 and 24x300 sec. frames in R band.
We do not detect the GRB OT (Maselli et al., GCNC #18478)
down to the limiting magnitude R_lim = 22.8 in both stacked images.
As the standard stars we used USNO-B1 objects from GCNCs #18521,
18558 and 18559.

We should note that nearby USNO-B1 source reported by
S. Dichiara et al. (GCNC #18510) and E. Mazaeva et al. (GCNC #18559)
is clearly detected in our images.
