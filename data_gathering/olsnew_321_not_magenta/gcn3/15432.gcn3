DATE:    13/11/01 13:34:48 GMT
FROM:    Changsu Choi at Seoul Nat U  <changsu@astro.snu.ac.kr>

Myungshin Im and Changsu Choi (CEOU/Seoul National Univ.), on behalf of a
larger collaboration: 

We observed GRB 131030A (Troja et al., GCN 15402) in B,R band using a 1-m
telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical Observatory (LOAO) in Arizona, US. 

The observation started at 2013-10-31 01:42:46 UT, or about 4.78 hours after
the BAT alert. 

In all of the BR images, we identify the afterglow, with approximate
magnitudes B ~ 19.29 +/-0.07, R ~ 18.88 +/- 0.09 mag (first epoch),
calibrated against stars in vicinity based on USNO-B1 photometry. 

We also confirm fading of the object from serial set of data we took about 4
and 6 hours later. 

Further observations are planned.

We thank the LOAO operator, Jae-Hyuk Yoon and In-Kyung Baek for performing 
the observation.

[GCN OPS NOTE(01nov13): This was delayed in distribution by 8 hours
because a new entry had to be added to the list.]
