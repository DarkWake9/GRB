We have imaged the field of GRB 070810B (Marshall   et al., GCN 6743)
with the Xinglong TNT 80cm telescope. Observation started from
15:24:17, 300s after the burst. A series of White and R band images
were obtained. Preliminary analysis shows no new object was seen in
our combined image within BAT error circle. The 3 sigam limit is
~20.5 in our co-added 20*20s White band image with mean time ~550s
after the burst, and ~21.7 in co-added 11*360s R band image with mean
time ~44 minutes after the burst derived from USNO-B1.0, Further
analysis is on going.
