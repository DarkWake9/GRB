Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161217A (trigger #727167)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 20276).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 150.658, 52.344 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 02m 38.0s
   Dec(J2000) = +52d 20' 38.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows an initial soft, weak peak from T-20 to T+20
sec, followed by a stronger peak from T+32 to T+48 sec.   T90 (15-350 keV) is 1
8.2 +- 5.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+33.77 to T+53.86 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.70 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-7  erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+42.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
