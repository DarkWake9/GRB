Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140413A (trigger #595616)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 16098).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 65.439, -51.188 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 21m 45.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -51d 11' 15.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 12%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a slow rise starting at ~T-65 sec,
peaking at ~T+80 sec, and a faster decay out to ~T+115 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 139.6 +- 12.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-52.0 to T+120.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.4 +- 0.5 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+77.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.3 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
