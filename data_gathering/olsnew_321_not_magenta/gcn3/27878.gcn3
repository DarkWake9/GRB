Nakamura, Y. Yatsu, and N. Kawai(TokyoTech) report on behalf of the
MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 200529A (Fermi GBM team, GCN #27844;
D'Elia et al. GCN #27845) with the optical three color (g', Rc, and
Ic) CCD cameras attached to the MITSuME 50 cm telescope of Akeno
Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.

The observation started on 10:25:35 UT. The first 47 images were
heavily affected by the bad weather at Akeno Observatory. We did not
detect the optical afterglow (Daniele et al., GCN #27846; WeiKang et
al., GCN #27847; Strausbaugh et al., GCN #27858) in the stacked image.
We obtained the 5-sigma limits as follows.

T0+[hour] MID-UT T-EXP[sec] 5-sigma limits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.3 11:35:06 1140 g'>17.3, Rc>17.1, Ic>16.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T0+: Elapsed time after the burst
T-EXP: Total Exposure time

We used UCAC4 catalog for flux calibration. The magnitudes are
expressed in the AB system. The images were processed in real-time
through the MITSuME GPU reduction pipeline (Niwano et al., submitted;
