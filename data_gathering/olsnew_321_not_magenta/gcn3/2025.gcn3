T.Cline on behalf of Konus-Wind team report:

GRB030329b was detected by Konus-Wind at 15:34:18.824 UT
and Helicon/Coronas-F at 15:34:15.347 UT
We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at
RA(2000) = 205.907 degrees,
Decl(2000)= -13.064 degrees,
and radius = 51.5 +/-  2.3 degrees (3 sigma).
Analysis of Konus-Wind data from both detectors gives
an ecliptic latitude of the source of -45 +/- 10 degrees.

Preliminary data analysis gives the following characteristics:
  - fluence in 15-2000 keV range = 2.0x10-5 erg cm-2 (for 65 seconds)
  - peak flux in 15-2000 keV range = 1.0x10-6 erg cm-2 s-1
  - Ep (at maximum intensity) = 90 keV
  - Ep (time integrated spectrum) = 50 keV
