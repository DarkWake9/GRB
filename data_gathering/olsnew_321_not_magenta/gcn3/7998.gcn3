report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 080721 (Marshall et al., GCN 7988;
Chen et al., GCN 7990) with ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope at
La Palma. The afterglow is well detected in a single 300 s exposure
starting on 21.875 July 2008 (10.6 hr after the GRB). Comparison with
several USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitudes) yields R = 20.0 +/- 0.2, where most
of the error comes from the calibration. Using the R-band magnitude
provided by Chen et al., the inferred decay index is alpha ~ 0.9.

Low resolution spectra (3 x 30 min) were also obtained. The combined
spectrum displays a strong absorption feature around 4350 A, with the flux
dropping substantially blueward of this feature. Associating it with
Ly-alpha gives a redshift of z ~ 2.6 for the burst. We find several other
absorption features, including O I, Si II, C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II
and Al II, corresponding to a redshift of z = 2.591 +/- 0.001, consistent
with the redshift reported by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 7997) and the UVOT
photometric redshift (Ward et al., GCN 7996).
