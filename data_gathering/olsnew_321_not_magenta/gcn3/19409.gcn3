L.Izzo (IAA-CSIC), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), C. Thoene
(IAA-CSIC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 160509A (Longo et al., GCN 19403; Ono et al.,
GCN 19404) with the iTelescope.Net <http://itelescope.net> (
http://www.itelescope.net)
T11 (Planewave CDK 0.51m) telescope located at the Mayhill observatory
(NM).
A single image of 300 s was obtained in the R filter, starting at 10:32:32
UT, 1.56 hr
after the GRB trigger. We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate at
the refined Swift-XRT position (Kennea et al. GCN 19408). We estimate an
upper limit magnitude of R = 19.5 mag (3-sigma), using the USNO-B1 catalog
as reference. We note that our image covers also the complete error box of
the MAXI (Ono et al., GCN 19404). Data are available on request.
