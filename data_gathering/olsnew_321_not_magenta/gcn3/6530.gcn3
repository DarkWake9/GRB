Adria C. Updike, Jason Puls, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), 
Matt Wood (FIT), Josh Cardenzana (U Missouri - Rolla), and Shelsea 
Pederson (MIT) report:

We re-imaged the field of GRB 070612A (GCN 6509, Grupe et al.) with the 
SARA 0.9m telescope at Kitt Peak under decent weather conditions.  We 
obtained 15 minutes of R-band images beginning 24 hours after the 
trigger (282006).

The afterglow (Updike et al. GCN 6515, Cenko et al. GCN 6525) is 
detected at a R-band magnitude of 18.3 +/- 0.4 as calibrated relative to 
9 USNO B1.0 stars, thus confirming the fading behavior.
