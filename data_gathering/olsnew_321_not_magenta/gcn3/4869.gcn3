B. E. Cobb, part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 060313
(Pagani  et al. GCN 4867) beginning ~0.3 hours post-burst
(2006-03-13 00:31 UT).  Optical imaging in B,V,R and I has a
field of view of 6'x6' and, therefore, covers the entire GRB
error circle.  IR imaging in J, H, K and Y has a smaller field
of view (2.4'x2.4') and covers a region totaling 5.8 square arcminutes in
the middle of the quoted error region.  Several dithered images
were obtained in each filter, with total summed exposure times
of 180s in each of BRIYJK and 120s in each of H and V.

Preliminary visual comparison of the optical images to the DSS
and the IR images to 2MASS frames does not reveal any new sources.
The detection limits of the combine ANDICAM images are slightly 
shallower than that of MASS and the DSS.
