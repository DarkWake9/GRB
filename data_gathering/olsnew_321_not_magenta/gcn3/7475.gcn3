W. Li and A. V. Filippenko, University of California, Berkeley,
report on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

We have analyzed the KAIT observations of the optical afterglow (OA) of GRB
080319C (GCN 7442, GCN 7460) as reported in GCN 7441. Our first 5 s unfiltered
observation started at 12:27:11 UT, 75 s after the BAT trigger. Four subsequent
5 s exposures from t = 81 s to 100 s indicate a smoothly decaying behavior (but
perhaps not power law). After reaching a minimum at t = 180 s (or perhaps a bit
earlier), the OA brightened steeply to a second prominent peak centered at t ~
320 s, after which the OA decayed as an approximate power law, with evidence
for a gradually steepening decay index. Selected photometry, all unfiltered but
calibrated to the R band via USNO B1:
