the AGILE Team:

The AGILE Mini-CALorimeter (MCAL) detected GRB 190530A at T0 = 2019-05-30
10:19:16.003 +/- 0.01 s (UTC), which was also detected by Fermi/GBM (GCN #24676).
The AGILE MCAL trigger occured around 8 s after the FERMI/GBM trigger.

An automatic MCAL Event Notice was also issued and is available at the GCN link:
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/agile_mcal.html

The event lasted about 12 s and released a total number of ~30900 counts in the
detector (in the 0.4-100 MeV energy range), above an average background rate of 637
counts/s.

The light curve shows two structures and several peaks, with a prompt emission
lasting around 1.6s and then, after about 5 s from T0, a second structure lasting for
around 7 s with the highest peak at around T0+7s.

The plot of the AGILE-MCAL light curve can be found at:

Bright emission in the 17-60 keV energy range is also detected by the SuperAGILE
instrument on-board of AGILE.

The GRB is clearly detected also by the AGILE scientific ratemeters: in particular,
the Anti-Coincidence (50-200 keV), SuperAGILE (20-60 keV), and MCAL (0.4-100 MeV)
ratemeters.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the energy
range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
