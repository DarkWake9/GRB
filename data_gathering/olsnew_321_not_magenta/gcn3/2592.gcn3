report:

"We have obtained several exposures covering the HETE/SXC
error box for GRB 040511 (Dullighan et al. GCN 2588) with the
Prime Focus Camera at the 4.2 m William Herschel telescope
at La Palma.  The images were taking at a considerable airmass
starting on May 11.991--12.022 UT (R-band filter, with a
stacked exposure time of 1800-s). After a visual comparison
with the Digital Sky Survey (DSS-2) red plate, no variable
object is found down to about R = 21 in a ~ 8' x 12' field
around the 3' SXC position."
