Y.-D. Hu, T.-R. Sun, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia and R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC), D. Hiriart and W. H. Lee (UNAM), C. J. Perez del Pulgar and I. Carrasco (UMA), I. H. Park (SKKU) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 220218A by Swift (D'Elia et al. GCNC 31608), the BOOTES-2/TELMA 0.6m telescope automatically started to observe the GRB localization within 2 min after trigger at the BOOTES-2 station at IHSM La Mayora (Algarrobo Costa, Spain). But due to bad weather, no useful early images were obtained. Later on, the BOOTES-5/JGT 0.6m robotic telescope at Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir (Mexico) responded to this burst starting on Feb 19 at 02:53 UT (~4.4 hours after trigger) right after the twilight. In the co-added image (23 x 60 s exposures in the clear filter), no optical afterglow is detected within the Swift/BAT error region (D'Elia et al. GCNC 31608) down to 20.5 mag. This non-detection is consistent with the MASTER observation (Lipunov et al. GCNC 31607).

We thank the staff at La Mayora and Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir for their excellent support.
