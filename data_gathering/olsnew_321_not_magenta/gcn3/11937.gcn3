Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink, we 
report further analysis of BAT GRB 110414A (trigger #451343) (Starling, et al., 
GCN Circ. 11931).  The BAT ground-calculated position is 
RA, Dec = 97.876, 24.349 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 31m 30.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +24d 20' 56.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The partial 
coding was 30%. 
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows several overlapping peaks with the first starting 
at ~T-100 sec, the main peaks at T-33, T+0, T+10, T+25, and a small peak at ~T+120 
sec, and ending at ~T+130 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 152.0 +- 73.2 sec (estimated error 
including systematics). 

The time-averaged spectrum from T-38.4 to T+135.6 sec is best fit by a simple 
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.70 +- 0.14. 
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.3 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak 
photon flux measured from T+8.62 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec. 
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
