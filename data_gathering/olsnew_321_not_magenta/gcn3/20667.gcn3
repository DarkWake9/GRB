The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170203A (Racusin et al., GCN 20583) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Feb 03.37, Feb 04.56, Feb 
06.56 and Feb 10.55 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the BAT 
location (Cummings et al., GCN 20597), with 3sigma upper limits of 183 
uJy, 84 uJy, 75 uJy and 171 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
