TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1658
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021027 (annulus)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 30831 s.  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration ~10 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of 6.4E-6 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 6.5E-7 erg/cm2 s.  We have triangulated
it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=178.852,
+35.645, whose radius is 68.409 +/- 0.139 degrees (3 sigma).

This triangulation can be improved, but at this point it is not clear
whether this event was observed by MO and thus whether a small error
box can be derived for it.
