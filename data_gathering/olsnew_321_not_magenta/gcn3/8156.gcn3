Using the BAT data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink for trigger 322590 at 08:15:09 UT (GCN 8153),
we conclude the likelihood that this trigger is a real GRB is very low.
The automated ground processing of the BAT data yields a very weak peak
in the image domain (5.9 sigma).

And 5 ksec of XRT data (the first 4 orbits) does not show any source.

The UVOT candidate mentioned in Circ 5183 is not an afterglow
and is consistant with the known source 2MASS J21334565+4201499.
