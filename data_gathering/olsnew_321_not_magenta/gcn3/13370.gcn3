S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks,
D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, and J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER GRNS GRB team,

and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The bright, short-duration GRB 120617A has been observed by INTEGRAL 
(SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, and MESSENGER (GRNS), so far, at about 54171 s UT 
(15:02:51).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
    ---------------------------------------------
     RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
    ---------------------------------------------
    Center:
      22.309 (01h 29m 14s) +33.804 (+33d 48' 14")
    Corners:
      22.485 (01h 29m 57s) +33.057 (+33d 03' 25")
      22.035 (01h 28m 08s) +34.123 (+34d 07' 23")
      22.140 (01h 28m 34s) +34.534 (+34d 32' 02")
      22.583 (01h 30m 20s) +33.482 (+33d 28' 55")
    ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 881 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 90 arcmin (the minimum one is 25 arcmin).

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
