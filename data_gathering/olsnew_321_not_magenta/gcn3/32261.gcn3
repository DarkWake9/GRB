the AGILE Team:

The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) of AGILE detected a gamma-ray 
transient
temporally coincident with the longÂ  GRB 220624A reported by Fermi/GBM in
GCN #32256 and also detected by AGILE/MCAL (Ursi et al., GCN #32259).

A preliminary GRID analysis shows a detection with a statistical 
significance
above 8 sigma over a time integration of 20 s starting from the T0 of GRB
220624A, at a sky position compatible with that of the GRB.
We obtained 25 events 2 of which are notably above 1 GeV.

The GRB position was about 30 deg off-axis from the GRID boresight.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
