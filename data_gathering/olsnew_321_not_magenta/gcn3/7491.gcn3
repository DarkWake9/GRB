Adria C. Updike, Brian C. Donehew, Ian Oliver, and Dieter H. Hartmann
(Clemson University) report:

We used the Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope and the FLAMINGOS instrument in NIR
imaging mode to obtain J-band exposures of the field of GRB 080320 (GCN
7473, Grupe et al.). In 80 minutes of stacked exposures, we marginally
detect the
afterglow (GCN 7488, Tanvir et al.) at J ~ 20 (using a 2MASS comparison
star located at RA=11:50:47.4, Dec=+57:10:07.41).  The midtime of the
stacked exposures was ~3 hours after the trigger.  Further analysis is
ongoing.
