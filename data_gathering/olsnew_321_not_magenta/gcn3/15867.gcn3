S. Guiriec (GSFC/CRESST/UMD), J. Racusin (GSFC), G. Vianello (Stanford)
and E. Bissaldi (University & INFN Trieste),
report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 19:46:32.2 on February 19, 2014, Fermi LAT detected high-energy emission
from GRB 140219A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 414531995
- Zhang et al., GCN 15866) and located by IPN (Hurley et al., GCN 15864).
GRB 140219A was not observable by LAT until ~T0+500 s due to
Earth occultation and it remained in the LAT field of view from ~T0+500 s
until T0+2300 s.

An analysis of the LAT data over a period covering ~T0+500 s to ~T0+2300 s
reveals a marginal detection with a TS of about 25 using the center of
the IPN error box.

The best LAT on-ground location is RA, Dec 158.2, 7.2 (J2000). The 90%
containment region (statistical error only) is asymmetrical with a width of
2.75 deg
and a height of 1.65 deg compatible with the IPN contour
(see http://fermigrb.stanford.edu/GRB140219A_tsmap.jpg).

The highest energy photon with a probability of being associated with
the GRB > 90% is a 1.6 GeV photon at T0+1350 s.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Sylvain Guiriec
(sylvain.guiriec*@nasa.gov <http://nasa.gov>*).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band
from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
