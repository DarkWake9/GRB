Swift observed the field of IceCube 201007A (GCN Circ. 28575) between 00:18:13
2020 October 8 and 02:19:15 on 2020 October 8, collecting a total of 3.8 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found 3 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are either known X-ray
sources, consistent with catalogued fluxes, or are unknown but with count rate
consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not claim any of
them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 201007A.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 4-9 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:
     
Source no:   1
RA (J2000):  265.15814 [degrees] = 17h 40m 37.95s
Dec (J2000): +5.30616 [degrees] = +05d 18' 22.2"
Error:       +5.5 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 9.1 (+3.1, -2.5) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       3.9 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1


Source no:   2
RA (J2000):  265.16388 [degrees] = 17h 40m 39.33s
Dec (J2000): +5.46461 [degrees] = +05d 27' 52.6"
Error:       +5.0 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 3.8 (+2.1, -1.6) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       1.6 (+0.9, -0.7) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1

     
Source no:   3
RA (J2000):  265.06867 [degrees] = 17h 40m 16.48s
Dec (J2000): +5.64807 [degrees] = +05d 38' 53.1"
Error:       +5.8 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 1.2 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10-2 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       5.3 (+2.1, -1.7) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1
