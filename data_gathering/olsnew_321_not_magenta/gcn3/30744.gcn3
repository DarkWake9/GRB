GCN Circ. 30697; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/210822A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 09:18:18.162 UTC
on 22 August 2021. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at
T-0.2 sec, peaks at T+0.1 sec and ends at T+11.0 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 10.1 +- 0.5 sec
and 5.8 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
