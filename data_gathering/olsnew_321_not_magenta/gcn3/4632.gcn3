We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit observation of
GRB 060202 (Fox et al., GCN4629), with a total exposure of 540 seconds.
The refined XRT position is:

RA(J2000) = 02h 23m 23.02s
Dec(J2000) = +38d 23' 05.7"

This position is 82.8 arcseconds from the BAT and 3.7 arcseconds from the
XRT position given in GCN 4629. We estimate an uncertainty of 4 arcseconds
radius (90% containment).

The 0.2-10 keV light curve in Windowed Timing (WT) mode starts 148.8
seconds from the BAT trigger (T0). The lightcurve shows a steep early
decay index of 2.7 followed by a flattening to a decay index of 0.2 at
T+310 s.

A preliminary spectral fit to the WT data gives a spectral power law
photon index of 2.52 +/- 0.03 in the [0.2-10] keV band with NH of 5.8e21 +/-
2e20, well above the galactic NH value for this direction of 5.1e20. The
unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV flux at the start of the XRT observation is
estimated to be about 2.5E-8 erg/cm2/s, flattening at a flux level of
about 2E-9 erg/cm2/s. We do not have sufficient data at this time to allow
an accurate extrapolation of the flux to T+24 hr.
