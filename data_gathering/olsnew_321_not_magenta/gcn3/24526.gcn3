In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190513bm at T0 = 2019-05-13
20:54:28 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL)
triggered data found no event candidates within a time interval covering
+/- 100 sec from the LIGO-Virgo T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S190513bm 90% c.l.
localization region (almost 80% of the given GW contour), from a minimum of
8.54E-07 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 1.73E-06 erg cm^-2  (assuming as
spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5). The average
off-axis angle is almost 90 degrees.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
