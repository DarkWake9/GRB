Swift observed the field of IceCube 200615A (GCN Circ. 27950) between 08:58:51 UT
2020 June 15 and 11:12:28 UT on 2020 June 16, collecting a total of 12.8 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 7-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.5 degrees.

We found 9 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are either known X-ray
sources consistent with catalogued fluxes, or are unknown but with count rates
consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not claim any of
them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 200615A

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 3.6-6.4 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:

Source 1:
  RA  (J2000): `09h 31m 17.80s`   = 142.82418 deg

  Err(radius):                    2.5"
  Count rate (0.3-10 keV):        0.040 ( +/- 0.004)
  Flux (0.3-10 keV):              1.72 (+/- 0.19) x 10^-12

  Notes: This does not match a catalogued X-ray source, but the RASS 
    3-sigma upper limit at this position corresponds to 0.028 ct/sec
    in XRT.

All errors are at the 90% confidence level, fluxes are observed flux in erg cm^-2 s^-1
and are calculated assuming an absorbed power-law with NH=3e20 and Gamma=1.7
