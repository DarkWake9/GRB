Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150710A (trigger #648437)
(Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 18000).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 194.484, 14.309 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 57m 56.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 18' 32.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two, possibly 4, overlapping peaks.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.15 +- 0.06 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.02 to T+0.22 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.63 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.9 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.38 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

These results are entirely consistant with a short GRB.
