Cameron J. Pace, Richard L. Pearson, and J. Ward Moody report for
Brigham Young University’s ROVOR team:

We report our observations in the field of GRB 090515 (Swift trigger
352108, Beardmore et al., GCN 9356) beginning 37.73 minutes post-burst
at 05:22:53.376 UT.

Using the 0.41m ROVOR telescope in Delta, Utah, we combined 70 x 60
second exposures in the R-band. No detection of an afterglow was
obtained after stacking the images. An upper limit of 21.4 ± 0.1 mag
was found by calibrating the frames using stars in the MRK 501 field.
