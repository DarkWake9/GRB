Swift Observatory Team:

At 07:08:05 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located 1A 0535+262 (trigger=1007266). Swift did not slew to the location
due to higher priority for the pre-planned target. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 84.721, +26.327 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 38m 53s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 19' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). 

This trigger was due to the current very bright outburst of
this object (>7 Crab at times) combined with technical effects
from yesterday's Star Tracker Loss-of-Lock misidentification.
