D. Kinoshita, Y.T. Chen, Y.L. Wu, K-Y. Huang, W-H. Ip(NCU), 
Y. Urata (RIKEN) on behalf of EAFON report:

" We have observed the field of GRB 051016B (Parsons et al. GCN 4103)
with Lulin 1m telescope at 17.845 (1.08 days after the burst).  The
R-band stacked image made from 5 x 300sec exposure do not show the
candidate source reported by Chen et al (GCN 4105). These results
suggest that the source located at RA=08:48:27.81 DEC=+13:39:20.0 is
the afterglow of GRB 051016B.

These images are available at
 http://140.115.34.82/~qq/grb/GRB051016B_LOT.jpg

Our light curve around 1.5-2 hour do not show power-law decay as we
reported (Chen et al GCN 4105). However, several early afterglows show
platue phase such as GRB 041006 (Urata et al. ApJL submitted).
