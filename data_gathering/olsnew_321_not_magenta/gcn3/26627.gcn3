report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:39:26.45 UT on 1 January 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200101A (trigger 599603971 / 200101861).

The location for this GRB was reported in the Fermi GBM Final Real-time
Localization GCN (GCN 26624).

The GBM light curve shows of multiple pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 10 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+3.3 s to T0+19.8 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 595 +/- 13 keV,
alpha = -0.82 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.15 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.38 +/- 0.05)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+11.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 124.8 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
