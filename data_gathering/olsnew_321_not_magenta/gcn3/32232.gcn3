MASTER-Amur robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State Pedagogical University) was pointed to the Integral GRB220619.53 (trigger No 9962,19h 34m 57.38s , +21d 51m 05.1s, R=0.0546667) errorbox  6676 sec after notice time and 6687 sec after trigger time at 2022-06-19 14:37:50 UT, with upper limit up to  12.2 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith distance = 41 deg. The sun  altitude  is -15.6 deg. 

MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope  located in Argentina (OAFA observatory of San Juan National University) was pointed to the Integral GRB220619.53 errorbox  49078 sec after notice time and 49090 sec after trigger time at 2022-06-20 02:24:33 UT, with upper limit up to  14.8 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 77 deg. The sun  altitude  is -59.9 deg. 

MASTER-OAGH robotic telescope  located in Mexico (OAGH National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics) was pointed to the Integral GRB220619.53 errorbox  58727 sec after notice time and 58739 sec after trigger time at 2022-06-20 05:05:21 UT, with upper limit up to  18.9 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 53 deg. The sun  altitude  is -26.7 deg. 

The galactic latitude b =  0 deg., longitude l = 58 deg.
