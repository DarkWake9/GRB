S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 50 s has been detected by IBAS in the
 IBIS/ISGRI data at 22:25:05 UT of 2021 July 7.   The corresponding WEAK
type Alert Packet with the burst position was distributed in real time
 (Alert n. 9296).

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.= 192.5460 deg
DEC.=  -63.2763 deg
with an uncertainty of  3   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.2  ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 5e-7 erg/cmq.
