report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-04-15T04:09:49.900 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 190415A(trigger ID: HEB190415173) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM(F. Kunzweiler et al. ,GCN 24123)
and INTEGRAL.

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 24.74 s measured from T0+0.89 s.
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+4.001 s, is 17011 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 100520 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
