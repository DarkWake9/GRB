The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analyzed LIGO and Virgo data around the time of the compact binary
coalescence (CBC) event candidate G297595 (GCN 21474) taking into account
our current understanding of calibration uncertainties.

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference (Veitch et al.,
PRD 91, 042003) and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, is available for
retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G297595

This is the preferred sky map at this time. The probability is
concentrated near R.A.=03h06m, Dec.=-44d36m. The 50% and 90% credible
regions span about 36 and 190 square degrees, respectively, somewhat
larger than the initial BAYESTAR sky map due to marginalizing over
calibration uncertainties. The 90% credible regions of the initial and
this updated localization have significant overlap, but the 50% credible
region is shifted east by its entire width.
