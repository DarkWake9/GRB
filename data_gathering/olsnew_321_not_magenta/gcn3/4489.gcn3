report:

We have observed the field of GRB060111B (Perri et al., GCN
4487) with a 12" telescope at Gualba observatory in Spain.  We
do not detect the afterglow seen by Yost et al. (GCN 4488) on
our 30x30s R-band combined image with mid-exposure time
21:59:40 UT (i.e. ~1.75h after the GRB) and 3-sigma limit 19.2.

No further observations are expected from spanish ground-based
telescopes due to technical and weather constraints.
