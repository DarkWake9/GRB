Using the data set from T-240 to T+482 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081203A (trigger #336489)
(Parsons, et al., GCN Circ. 8595).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 233.071, 63.514 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 32m 16.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +63d 30' 50.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks.  The first starts
at ~T-70 sec and peaks at ~T+10 sec.  The second peaks at ~T+32 sec and
ends at ~T+400 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 294 +- 71 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-68.9 to T+405.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.54 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+31.12 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
