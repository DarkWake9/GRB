Andreas von Kienlin (MPE) and Valerie Connaughton (UAH) report for the 
GBM team:

Fermi GBM operations are proceeding during the U.S. government shutdown. 
GCN trigger
notices and GRB positions are being distributed, and GRB Burst Advocates 
are processing
and supplying positions for GRB triggers.

GBM data products are usually supplied by the instrument team to the 
Fermi Science Support
Center and hosted on the HEASARC servers at NASA Goddard Space Flight 
Center.  These
servers are offline during the U.S. government shutdown with the 
consequence that GBM data
files have not been available.

Data servers at GBM partner Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany, 
have now been
deployed to host GBM GRB trigger data until NASA GSFC resumes normal 
operations.  GRB
trigger data from October 1 2013 onwards are available for download at:

http://www2011.mpe.mpg.de/gbm/

Procedures to supply these data products require human intervention and 
are thus subject
to delays outside CET working hours.  Please direct any inquiries to 
valerie@nasa.gov.
