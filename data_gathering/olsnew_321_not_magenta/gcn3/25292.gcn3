The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:03:17 UT on 8 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190808B (trigger 586980202.431972 / 190808752).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 168.1, Dec = 39.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 12m, 39d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
