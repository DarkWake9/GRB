The short GRB 160410A (Swift/BAT observation:
Gibson et al., GCN 19271; Sakamoto et al., GCN 19276)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=18592.644 s UT (05:09:52.644).

The light curve shows a short, hard pulse with a total duration is ~2 s.
The emission is seen up to ~4 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(1.20 ± 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0-0.016, of (2.8 ± 0.4)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a cutoff power-law
(CPL) function with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.71(-0.20,+0.26),
and the peak energy Ep = 1416(-356,+528) keV,
chi2 = 92/97 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep with only an upper limit on beta of -2.1,
chi2 = 92/96 dof.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB160410_T18592/

Assuming the redshift z=1.717 (Selsing et al., GCN 19274)
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,
Omega_M = 0.27, and Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters:
the isotropic energy release E_iso is ~4.0x10^52 erg,
the peak luminosity L_iso is ~7.5x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy of the time-integrated spectrum,
Ep,i, is ~4660 keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
