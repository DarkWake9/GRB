(ISAS/JAXA) report:

"We observed the error region of GRB 070616 (Swift/BAT trigger #282445;
Starling et al., GCN 6542; Sakamoto et al., GCN circ 6543; Starling et
al., GCN Report 66.2) with the very wide-field camera WIDGET located at
Kiso, Japan. The WIDGET monitored the region with repeat of unfiltered
5-second exposures between 27 seconds before and 136 seconds after the
burst.

We did not find any  optical emission from the afterglow position
(Fatkhullin et al. GCN  6547). The 1-sigma limiting magnitude of
each frame derived by the Tycho-2 catalog was around V=11.8 magnitudes."
