behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:02:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060814 (trigger=224552).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 221.348, +20.583 {14h 45m 23s, +20d 34' 58"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows at least 3 large peaks. 
The first peak starts at T-10 sec, peaks at T+16 sec with 12,000 cnts/sec. 
The second peaks at T+70 sec at 6000 cnts/sec.  The third peaks at T+120 sec
at ~1000 cnts/sec. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:03:30 UT, 72 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright variable X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) = 14h 45m 21.2s, Dec(J2000) = +20d 35' 02.7", with an
estimated uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). 
This location is 32 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within
the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 0.1s image was
5.7e-08 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 80 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The typical
3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. The 8'x8' region for the
list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error
circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of  0.04.
