report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:21:40 08 Apr 2014 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
triggered (trigger=595162).  This was a sub-threshold trigger
due to a spatially coincident location with the known galaxy A0732-5019.
Analysis using the fully downlinked event-by-event data does not show
any significant source.

XRT observations consisted of only 31s of valid data, because the star tracker
was not able to get a lock because there were too few stars.  Observations began
about 1 hour after the trigger, and no new source is detected in the field.

The UVOT images were trailed, also due to the star tracker loss of lock.
Quantitative analysis is not possible; visual comparison with the DSS does
not reveal any new sources.
