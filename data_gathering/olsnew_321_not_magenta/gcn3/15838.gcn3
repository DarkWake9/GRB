We imaged the location of the Swift GRB140215A (Markwardt et al., GCN 15837) with
the Large Monolithic Imager mounted on the 4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope.
Observations began at 4:09:50 UT on 15 February 2014, ~ 2.7 min after the
Swift BAT trigger time, and were taken under sub-optimal conditions (moderate
cloud cover and bright moon).

We detect the bright optical afterglow in individual exposures beginning at
this time.  Using several nearby point sources from USNO-B1 reference, we measure
a magnitude of r' ~ 13.5 mag in our first exposure.  Multi-color observations are
ongoing.

We thank the entire staff of the Discovery Channel Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
