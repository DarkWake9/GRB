Leicester), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T.
Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) and V. D'Elia report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 6.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 210930A (D'Elia et al. GCN
Circ. 30897), from 143 s to 52.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 63 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 30900).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.71 (+0.09, -0.08).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 4.04 (+0.30, -0.27). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.46 (+0.18, -0.16) x 10^22 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 9.6 x 10^19 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.2 (+0.4, -0.3) and
a best-fitting absorption column of 6.1 (+2.4, -2.0) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x 10^-11 (7.5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     6.1 (+2.4, -2.0) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 9.6 x 10^19 cm^-2
Excess significance: 5.0 sigma
Photon index:	     2.2 (+0.4, -0.3)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.71, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 6.7 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.5 x
10^-13 (5.0 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
