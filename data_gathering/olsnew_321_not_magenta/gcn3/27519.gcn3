Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200409A (trigger #965484)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 27509).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 60.555, -50.243 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 02m 13.3s
   Dec(J2000) = -50d 14' 36.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses that start
at ~T0 and ends at~T+19 s. The main peak occurs at ~T0. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 17.91 +- 5.20 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.01 to T+19.01 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.14 +- 0.44.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.6 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
