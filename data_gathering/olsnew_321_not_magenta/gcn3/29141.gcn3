We used the Sinistro camera on the 1-m LCO Global Telescope Network (LCOGT,
Brown et al., 2013) to observe the afterglow of short-duration GRB 201221D
(Page et al., GCN #29112).

Two sets of 300s exposures were acquired in g-r-i bands between
2020-12-22T07:57 and 2020-12-22T08:47 UTC. The observations were performed
under proposal IDs TOM2020A-008 (PI Andreoni) and NOAO2020B-005 (PI
Coughlin).

We do not identify any source within 3.9 arcsec of the enhanced Swift-XRT
position (Evans et al., GCN #29119). Photometric upper limits, calibrated
against Pan-STARRS DR1 magnitudes (Chambers et al., 2016), were measured to
be g > 22.8, r > 22.2, and i > 21.5 mag (5-sigma) after image stacking.

The candidate optical counterpart (transient or host galaxy: Malesani et
al., GCN #29117; Dichiara et al., GCN #29128; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN
#29132; Kilpatrick et al., GCN #29133) is too faint to be detectable in our
observations, which did not show any significant brightening, as expected.
