Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121212A (trigger #541371)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 14064).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 177.787, 78.052 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 51m 08.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +78d 03' 05.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a couple peaks starting at ~T-3 sec,
peaking at ~T+0 sec, and ending at ~T+16 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
6.8 +- 1.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.02 to T+7.84 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.65 +- 0.40.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
