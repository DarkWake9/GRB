Sayan Chakraborti, Naveen Yadav and Alak Ray (Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India) report:

We observed the optically dark GRB 100413A, whose radio afterglow has
been detected by the EVLA at 8.5 GHz (Frail et al, GCN 10611), with
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on April 19.1 UT. We do
not find, any source at its position, at the observing frequency of
1.28 GHz, down to the 3 sigma upper limit of 124 uJy.

We thank the staff of the GMRT that made this observation possible.
GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research.
