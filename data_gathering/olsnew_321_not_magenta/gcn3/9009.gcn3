GRB090315 was observed by Odyssey (HEND and GRS), MESSENGER (GRNS),
Konus-Wind, AGILE (MCAL and SuperAGILE, although the spacecraft was in
the SAA and the background was high; the event was outside the field of
view of SuperAGILE), Suzaku (WAM), and Swift (BAT, but outside the
coded field of view) at 04:12:56 UT.  The burst had a fluence of
several times 10^-5 erg cm^-2  and  a duration of about 9 s (detailed
spectral information will be provided in a separate GCN Circular).  We
have triangulated it to the following preliminary, 3 sigma error box,
whose area is 0.8 sq. deg.

-----------------------------------------------
       RA(2000), deg            Dec(2000), deg
-----------------------------------------------
Center:
  142.641 (09h 30m 34s)   -27.556 (-27d 33' 21")
Corners:
  140.759 (09h 23m 02s)   -26.958 (-26d 57' 28")
  140.936 (09h 23m 45s)   -27.257 (-27d 15' 25")
  144.531 (09h 38m 07s)   -28.062 (-28d 03' 43")
  144.339 (09h 37m 21s)   -27.782 (-27d 46' 57")
-----------------------------------------------

This error box may be improved.

The Tupi ground-based muon telescope (Augusto et al., Phys. Rev. D 77,
123008, 2008) which was pointed in the direction of the burst
registered a significant increase in the count rate in a single 10 s
long bin which included the time of the burst, while a second telescope
whose field of view did not include the burst did not.  (The count
rates and fields of view have been posted at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/090315).  The muon energy threshold is ~0.1 GeV,
corresponding to primary photons above 10 GeV.  Thus we believe that
the energy spectrum of this GRB extended at least into the multi-GeV
energy range.
