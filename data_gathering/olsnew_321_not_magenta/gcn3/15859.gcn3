Skynet continued observing the Swift-BAT localization of GRB 140213A 
(Holland et al., GCN 15825, Swift trigger 586569) with the 14-inch R-COP 
telescope at Perth Observatory, Australia, and with 4 16-inch telescopes 
of the PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile.  Previous observations with R-COP 
began at 59s and continued until 92m post-trigger (Trotter et al., GCN 
15828). Observations resumed with PROMPT-CTIO at t=5.5h, and continued 
at R-COP and PROMPT-CTIO until t=32h, with a total of ~600x160s new 
exposures in the BVRI bands.

We continue to detect an uncatalogued optical source in all bands at the 
position of the source detected by the Swift UVOT (Siegel & Holland, GCN 
15826). The source faded from R=14.3 at t=113s to R=17.8 at t=73m, 
bottomed out at R=19.0 at t~6h, and then rebrightened to R=18.6 by 
t=23h.  Flattening or rebrightening of the light curve is observed in 
all four bands.

Magnitudes are in the Vega system, calibrated to ten APASS-DR7 stars in 
the field, and have not been corrected for the Galactic foreground 
extinction corresponding to E(B-V)=0.07 (Schlegel et al. 1998).

Skynet observations are ongoing.
