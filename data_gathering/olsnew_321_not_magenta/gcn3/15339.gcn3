SUBJECT: GRB 131014A: Enhanced XRT position
DATE:    13/10/15 13:18:11 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and A. Amral-Rogers (U. Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 1.7 ks of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT images for GRB
131014A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the 
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 
catalogue): RA, Dec = 100.30220, -19.09781 which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000.0)	= 06h 41m 12.53s
   Dec (J2000.0) = -19d 05' 52.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position is 5.9 arcsec from the initial XRT position reported by 
Kennea & Rogers (GCN 15335) and 11.2 arcmin from the LAT position 
(Desiante et al. (GCN 15333), but 4.1 arcsec from the NOT optical 
position of Schulze et al (GCN 15337).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
