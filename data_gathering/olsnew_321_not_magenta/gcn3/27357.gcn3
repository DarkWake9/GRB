We initiated a new round of observations of the NS merger GW170817 with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) to continue following its evolution at ~
2.5 years after the merger. Four observations will be acquired between
March 9 and March 15, for a total exposure time of 100 ks. Here we report
on the first observation (ObsID 21323, PI Margutti; program 20500299),
which was acquired on March 09, 2020 at 22:04:48 UT (~935 days since
merger) with an exposure time of 24.29 ks.

X-ray emission is detected at the location of GW170817 with a significance
of ~ 3-sigma (Gaussian equivalent) and a 0.5-8 keV count-rate of  (1.2 +/-
0.7)e-04 c/s, and a total of ~ 2.8 net photons. Assuming a simple power-law
spectrum with photon index Gamma=1.6 and no intrinsic absorption, as found
in previous Chandra observations (e.g. Hajela et al. 2019, ApJL, 886L, 17H),
and following the same spectra-extraction procedure as in Hajela et al.
2019, the count-rate above translates into an unabsorbed flux of  ~ (3.2
+/- 1.9)e-15 erg/s/cm2 (0.3-10 keV). The Galactic neutral hydrogen column
density in the direction of the transient is N_H = 7.8e+20cm-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005). This X-ray flux measurement is nominally above, yet
statistically consistent with the off-axis jet model predictions given the
large flux uncertainties. Further CXO observations comprising the remaining
exposure time of ~75 ks are scheduled in the next few days and will help
quantify the statistical evidence for the possible departure from the
off-axis jet model (which might represent the onset of the kilonova
afterglow).

We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible.
