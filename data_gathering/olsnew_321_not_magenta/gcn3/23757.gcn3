The reported AB magnitudes in our earlier reports of UKIRT observations (Im
et al. GCN 23740, 23747) had errors in AB corrections, and hence the AB
magnitudes were reported to be a bit fainter than real. The Vega magnitudes
are correct. Also, the reported UT time in the table and the text of Im et
al. (GCN 23747, 23756) had errors. Below is a summary of our reported
photometry with corrections to the AB mag.

Filter Date UT-start Vega_Mag (AB mag)
K   2019-01-16 05:06:05.011    15.5 +/- 0.1   (17.4 AB)
H   2019-01-16 05:26:45.974    16.5 +/- 0.1   (17.9 AB)
J    2019-01-16 05:47:58.042   17.5 +/- 0.1    (18.4 AB)
J    2019-01-17 05:31:27.984   18.0 +/- 0.1    (18.9 AB)
J    2019-01-18 08:30:12.989   18.3 +- 0.12    (19.2 AB)

We apologize for any confusion that this might have caused.
