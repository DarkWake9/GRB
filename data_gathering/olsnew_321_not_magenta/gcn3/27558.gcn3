report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:08:40.71 UT on 12 April 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200412B (trigger 608375325 / 200412381),
which was also detected by the Fermi LAT (Longo et al. 2020, GCN 27557)
and observed to have a candidate optical afterglow by MASTER
(GCN 27555 & GCN 27556). The GBM on-ground location is consistent
with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 59
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a duration (T90) of about 6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+3.1s to T0+21.5 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 257 +/- 4 keV,
alpha = -0.54 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.24 +/- 0.02.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.00 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 127.5 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
