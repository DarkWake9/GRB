The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:35:24 UT on 23 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200723A (trigger 617214929.786984 / 200723691).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 249.5, Dec = 58.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 37m, 58d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 42.0 degrees.
