The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:37:00 UT on 4 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211204C (trigger 660346625.552088 / 211204901).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 346.4, Dec = 55.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 05m, 55d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 146.0 degrees.
