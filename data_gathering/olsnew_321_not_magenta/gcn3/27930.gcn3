E. Bissaldi (Politecnico and INFN Bari) and S. Lesage (UAH)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 05:30:08.21 UT on 13 June 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200613A (trigger 613719013 / 200613229).
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization is reported in GCN #27926.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 25 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a bright initial emission episode
followed by a later weaker emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 470 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+50 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 111 +/- 3 keV,
alpha = -1.08 +/- 0.02, and beta = -2.58 +/- 0.08.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.10 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+12.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 27.2 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
