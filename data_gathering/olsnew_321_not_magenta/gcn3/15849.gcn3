We again observed the field of GRB 140215A (Markwardt, et al.,
GCN 15837) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from
2014/02 16.20 to 2014/02 16.36 UTC (24.65 to 28.57 hours after the
BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.18 hours exposure in the r and
i bands and 0.88 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We continue to detect the previously reported source in all bands, at
fainter magnitudes than the previous epoch of RATIR observations (Butler
et al., GCN 15841). In comparison with 2MASS, we obtain the following
detections:

  r     21.51 +/- 0.11
  i     21.19 +/- 0.10
  Z     21.37 +/- 0.24
  Y     20.68 +/- 0.21
  J     20.69 +/- 0.16
  H     20.43 +/- 0.18

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB. In comparison to the
previous epoch of RATIR observations the source has faded with
approximate power-law index of t^-1 in all bands.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
