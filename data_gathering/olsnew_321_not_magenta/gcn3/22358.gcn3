The long-duration GRB 180112A (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7990;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 16:29:11.736) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 16:29:08.39 on 12 January 2018.  The burst signal
was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows three isolated episodes.  The first weak
episode peaks around T+2 sec with the duration of 4 sec.  The second
episode has two overlapping pulses, and its emission starts at T+80 sec,
peaks at T+100 sec and ends at T+110 sec.  The third brightest episode
has a single pulse, and its emission starts at T+200 sec, peaks at T+230 sec
and ends at T+250 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the
SGM data are 155 +- 80 sec and 134.5 +- 1.2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
