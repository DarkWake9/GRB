K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Following the detection of an X-ray afterglow candidate for GRB 140716A
(Page, GCN Circ. 16600), Swift obtained a second epoch of observations
starting 357 ks after the BAT detection.

The X-ray source has now faded to a level of (1.4 +0.8/-0.6) x 10^-3 count
s^-1, and the light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a
decay index of alpha=1.16 (+0.39, -0.27). We therefore confirm that this
is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 140716A.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020390.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
