The 1.04m Sampurnanand telescope at ARIES Nainital began observations
of the Swift-detected GRB 150120B (D'Elia et al., GCN 17314) starting at
13:34:44 UT on 2015-01-20. Several frames in R_c pass-band 300sec each
were acquired in poor sky conditions.

In the co-added image (6x300 sec), we detect the optical afterglow candidate
at R_c ~ 21.7+-0.1 mag to the location consistent with that reported by
Perley et al. (GCN 17315), Guidorzi et al. (GCN 17316). The temporal
power-law
flux decay seems to follow an index of 0.7 at the epoch of our observations
as reported by Perley & Cenko (GCN 17335). The photometry was performed in
comparison to nearby USNO- B1 stars.
