A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OAB), A. Fiorenzano and G. Mainella (INAF/TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:.

We observed the field of GRB 140515A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 16267) using the NICS near-Infrared camera on the 3.6m TNG Telescope (La Palma, Canary Islands).

We obtained a series of imaging observations in the J and H bands for a total exposure time of 30 and 60 minutes respectively. The GRB afterglow is clearly detected in both bands at a level of
