TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8493
SUBJECT: GRB 081104: GROND found no Optical/NIR Afterglow
DATE:    08/11/07 09:38:11 GMT
FROM:    Christian Clemens at MPE  <cclemens@mpe.mpg.de>

C. Clemens, T. Kruehler, J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) and G. Szokoly 
(Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest) report on behalf of the GROND team:
 
We observed the field of GRB 081104 for a second time at 04:29 UT on November 
6th, 2008, 42.9 hr after the GRB trigger with 73.0 min of total exposures in 
g'r'i'z' and 64.0 min in JHK. Observations were performed at an average 
seeing of 1.7".

We still detect the previously reported source (Clemens et al., GCN #8482) 
with magnitudes identical within the errors to our first epoch observations.

Therefore, this object is most likely not the afterglow of GRB 081104.
