We report wide-field near-infrared follow-up observations of the localization region of the gravitational wave event S200114f (GCN 26734) by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey (Moore and Kasliwal 2019). Gattini-IR is a newly commissioned near-IR camera with a field of view of 25 square degrees mounted on a robotic 30 cm telescope at Palomar observatory (De et al. 2020).

We started customized Target of Opportunity observations at UT 2020-01-14 05:02. The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We imaged a total of 479 square degrees, covering 89.1% of the probability region of the event until UT 11:21. We obtained a second epoch of observations starting the next night at at UT 2019-01-15 02:03 and continuing until UT 07:59. All data were processed and stacked with the Palomar Gattini-IR data reduction pipeline. The typical limiting magnitude of each field visit (300s second exposure time) was between 15.9 and 16.3 AB mag in J-band. No viable counterparts with at least two detections and without previous history of variability were identified in the single epoch stacks within the survey region.
