Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080516 (trigger #311762)
(Holland, et al., GCN Circ. 7733).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 120.661, -26.146 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 02m 38.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 08' 46.9" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 38%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two well separated peaks.  The first peak
starts at T-0.1 sec, peaks at T+0.3 sec, and ends at T+1.0 sec.  The second
peak starts at T+3.5 sec, peaks at T+5.5 sec, and ends at T+7.5 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.8 +- 0.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.1 to T+6.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.82 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
