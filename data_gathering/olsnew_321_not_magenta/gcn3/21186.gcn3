Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170531B (trigger #755354)
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 21171).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 286.901, -16.414 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  19h 07m 36.3s
  Dec(J2000) = -16d 24' 51.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T0 and ends at ~T+180 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 164.13 +- 8.82 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.55 to T+181.67 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.95 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+42.71 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
