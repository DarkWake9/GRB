The short GRB 071227 (Swift-BAT trigger #299787:
Sakamoto et al., GCN 7147, Sato et al., GCN 7148) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=72828.722 s UT (20:13:48.722).
The Konus-Wind light curve shows a multipeaked structure
with a total duration of ~1.7 s.
Most of the burst was recorded in the pre-history part of the trigger 
for which multichannel spectra are not measured.
The multichannel spectrum of the remaining part contains too few counts
to be analyzed.

Analysis of the Konus-Wind data in three energy bands
yields a burst fluence of (1.6 +/- 0.2)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.144 s
(3.5 +/- 1.1)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1.3 MeV energy range).
The 3-channel time-integrated spectrum can be described
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha ~0.7 and Ep ~1 MeV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
