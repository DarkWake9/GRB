D. Malesani, T. Kruehler (DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA/CSIC and 
DARK/NBI), D. Xu (WIS), N. R. Tanvir (Univ. Leicester), J. Gorosabel 
(IAA/CSIC), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), S. Geier (NOT and DARK/NBI), 
T. Pursimo (NOT), report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the field of GRB 120805A (Troja et al., GCN 13588) on two 
epochs with the NOT optical telescope, located in La Palma (Canary 
Islands). The two observations were carried out on mean dates Aug 5.936 
and 13.896 UT, that is 1.0 hr and 8.0 days after the GRB, respectively.

The source first noticed by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 13591) is detected in 
both our images, and it varied significantly between the two epochs, as 
well as compared to the CAHA report (Gorosabel et al., GCN 13591). We 
note that the object position is now fully consistent with the revised 
XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 13638). We thus conclude that this source 
is the optical afterglow of GRB 120805A.

The source varied by only about 2 mag between the two NOT epochs 
(corresponding to a power-law decay slope of ~0.3), suggesting that in 
the later image the host galaxy could be contributing to the total light.

We thank Phil Evans for discussion about the XRT localization of this 
afterglow.
