TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  19523
SUBJECT: GRB 160611A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    16/06/11 23:00:57 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), G.
Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), S. Campana (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 160611A at 22:25:16.5 UT,
2682.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 164.42342,
-70.39301 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 10h 57m 41.62s
   Dec(J2000) = -70d 23' 34.8"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 19 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.70 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 7.6
(+2.39/-2.15) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
