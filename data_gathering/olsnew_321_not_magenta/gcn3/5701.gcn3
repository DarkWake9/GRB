on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

"We have reobserved the field of GRB 060930 (GCNC 5665)
on a third epoch. This time we obtained frames with the
3.5m Calar Alto telescope in the H-band on Oct. 5.81 UT.
The magnitude of the suspected afterglow candidate that
we reported in GCNC 5682 is consistent with the one measured
on the first epoch and we believe that the data taken on
the second epoch (Oct 1.86 UT) were severely affected due
to the presence of the Moon four degrees away.

We thus conclude that the object reported in GCNC 5682
is not the near-IR afterglow to GRB 060930. A search for
variability of the faintest near-IR sources within the INTEGRAL
error box is under way.

We acknowledge Heather F. Swan for also independently
pointing out this to us by means of AEOS data."
