The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of IceCube-200109A (2020-01-09 23:41:39) the spacecraft was
preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2181 and 2182. Therefore,
no scientific data are available between 2020-01-09 16:27 and
2020-01-10 01:48.
