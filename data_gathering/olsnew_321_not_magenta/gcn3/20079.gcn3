A. Kaur (Clemson U.), G. Henson (ETSU), and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson U.)

report optical observations of GRB161017A discovered by Swift (Yurkov et al.,
GCN Circ. 20063;Troja et al., GCN Circ. 20064).



The UVOT source described in Troja et al., GCN Circ. 20064, is at a
position consistent with the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al.,GCN
Circ. 20067) and is  fading (Breeveld & Troja, GCN Circ. 20074) at the
preliminary UVOT position:

     RA  (J2000) =  09:31:04.60 = 142.76915 (deg.)

     Dec (J2000) = +43:07:36.3  =  43.12676 (deg.)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.42 arc sec. (radius, 90% confidence).



We observed the field on 2016-10-18.17 UT centered at 09:31:4.65
+43:07:36.34 (J2000), imaging for 20 minutes in the Cousins R filter with
the 1.0m JKT telescope (SARA-RM) located on La Palma, Canary Isles, Spain.
We detect the fading source at an R magnitude of 17.606 +/- 0.017 using the
Andor IkonL 2048 x 2048 CCD (11.6 x 11.6 arc min). The photometric standard
GD71 was utilized for calibration.
