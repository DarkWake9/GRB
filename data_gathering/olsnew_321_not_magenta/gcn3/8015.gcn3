team, report:

The bright GRB 080723B localized by IBIS/ISGRI (Gotz et al., GCN 8002) 
and SuperAGILE (Del Monte et al., GCN 8003) triggered Konus-Wind at 
T0=48143.773 s UT (13:22:23.773).

The burst light curve shows multipeaked structure with a duration of ~100 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 8.40(-0.56, +0.47)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+54.784 s
of (1.11 +/- 0.15)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+87.808 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.755 (-0.102, +0.103),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.42(-0.40, +0.18),
the peak energy Ep = 225(-21, +27) keV (chi2 = 64.2/58 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
