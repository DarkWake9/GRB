on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB151006A (Kocevski et al., GCN 18398)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 17:22 UT on 6th October, 7.4h after
the BAT trigger, to 18:17 UT. The total exposure of 26.5 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 18403) down
to limiting magnitude of Ks=15.2 (Vega, S/N=10). The photometric
calibration was made against 2MASS field stars.
