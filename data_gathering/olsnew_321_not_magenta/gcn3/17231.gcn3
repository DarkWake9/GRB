A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) on behalf of a large
collaboration reports:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope automatically began
observing Swift GRB 141225A (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 17229).
Within the XRT error circle we found an uncatalogued
object at the following position:

RA(J2000) = 09:15:06.92
Dec(J2000)= +33:47:30.6

with r=20.3 +- 0.1 mag at 36 minutes post trigger,
calibrated against SDSS nearby stars.
