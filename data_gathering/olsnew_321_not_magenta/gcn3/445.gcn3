"The region of GRB 991106 (GCN #434) was observed with the Narrow 
Field Instruments (NFI) on board BeppoSAX from Nov. 6.781 to 7.565 U.T. 
(starting about 8 hrs after the burst trigger time) for a total net 
exposure time of 32 ks. In the 2-10 keV image of all data from both 
Medium-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer units 2 and 3, a faint point 
source (1 SAX J222441+5422.7) is detected, with a chance probability 
for the source being a background fluctuation of 5E-4, within the WFC 
error box (Gandolfi et al, GCN #435). The average source flux in 
2-10 keV band was (1.7+-0.4)x10E-3 counts/s corresponding to 
1.25x10E-13 erg cmE-2 sE-1, assuming a crab-like spectrum. 
The source position is R.A. = 22h24m40.8s, Dec.= +54d22'45" (Eq. 2000.0) 
and the error radius is 1'.5. 
The radio source reported by Frail (GCN #444) is 2'.1 from this X-ray 
source position and it lies outside the NFI error circle. The data do 
not allow to draw a useful constraint about the variability of this source. 
The probability of detecting a foreground source at this flux level or 
brighter in the WFC error circle is expected to be ~10% as suggested by the 
BeppoSAX LogN-LogS (Fiore et al., 1999).
