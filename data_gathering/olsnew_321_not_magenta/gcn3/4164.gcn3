A. de Ugarte Postigo, F. J. Aceituno and S. Guziy
(IAA-CSIC Granada, Spain), on behalf of a large
collaboration,


report:

"We have performed new astrometric measurements of the host galaxy of
GRB 051022 (Olive et al. GCNC 4131, Castro-Tirado et al. GCNC 4143)
using a deep V-band image taken with the 1.5 m telescope at Observatorio
de Sierra Nevada on Oct 24.9 UT. Coordinates yield (J2000):

AR: 23:56:04.10  Dec:+19:36:24.2

with 0".5 error (based on USNO-A2.0). This is consistent, within errors, 
with the positions earlier reported in nIR (GCNC 4143), radio 
(Cameron et al. GCN 4154), mm (Bremer et al. GCNC 4157) and X-rays 
(Patel et al. GCNC 4163)."

[GCN OPS NOTE(26oct05): Per author's request, "in optical (GCNC 4143)"
was changed to "in nIR (GCNC 4143)" and "Patel et al. GCNC 4146"
was changed to "Patel et al. GCNC 4163.]
