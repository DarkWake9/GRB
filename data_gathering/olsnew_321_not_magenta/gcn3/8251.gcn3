report:

GRB080916C (Goldstein and van der Horst, GCN 8245; Tajima et
al., GCN 8246) was also observed by AGILE (MCAL, SuperAGILE, and ACS -
but not localized), RHESSI, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind,
and MESSENGER.  A preliminary triangulation gives a long,
narrow error box centered at RA, Dec = 119.830, -56.790 degrees
(0.2 degrees from the center of the LAT error circle), whose
corners are:

 RA(2000)    DEC(2000)             
  119.486    -62.130
  120.126    -62.702
  119.901    -50.632
  120.321    -51.274

A figure is posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/080916C.

Using the RHESSI data between 100 keV and 17 MeV, the time-integrated
spectrum for the 62-second interval beginning at 00:12:46 UT can be described
by a cutoff power law with alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.3, Epeak ~ 1100 +/- 500 keV,
and fluence ~ (9.0 +/- 1.6) x 10^-5 ergs/cm^2 (100 keV - 10 MeV).


Both the triangulation and the energy spectrum can be substantially
improved.
