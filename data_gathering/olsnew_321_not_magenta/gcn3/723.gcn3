K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, E. Mazets, and
S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team, and F. Frontera,
C. Guidorzi, and E. Montanari, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team,
report:

This burst (GCN 722) was detected by Ulysses, Konus Wind, and the
BeppoSAX GRBM.  We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA(2000)=312.137 o, Decl(2000)=+32.151 o, with radius 77.784 +/- 0.043
degrees (3 sigma).  This annulus intersects the BeppoSAX WFC error
circle to form an ~28 sq. arcmin. error region, reducing the area of
the error circle by ~25%.  A map may be found at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/000620.  This annulus may be improved.
