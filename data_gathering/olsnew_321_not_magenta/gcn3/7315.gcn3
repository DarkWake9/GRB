The bright, long, IPN localized GRB 080211 (Hurley et al., GCN 7295)
was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 07:23:39 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure, starting at
T0-10 s, ending at T0+25 s with a duration (T90) of about 25 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 2.8(+0.1,-0.1) x 10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+6 s was 5.5(+0.4,-0.6)
photons/cm^2/s in the same  energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-10s to T0+25s is well fitted by a power-law with exponential cutoff
model:
 dN/dE ~  E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
 alpha       1.1(+0.2,-0.2), and
 Epeak       483(+66,-46) keV (chi^2/d.o.f. = 38/21).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
