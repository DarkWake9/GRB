The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:45:52 UT on 16 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211216A (trigger 661329957.05626 / 211216282).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 44.4, Dec = -64.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 57m, -64d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 31.0 degrees.
