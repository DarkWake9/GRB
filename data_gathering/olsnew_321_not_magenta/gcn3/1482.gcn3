Konus-Wind and Mars Odyssey-HEND observed this burst (HETE 2262, GCN
1471).  (Ulysses data are being downlinked and should become available
within several hours).  The triangulation annulus is centered at RA,
Decl(2000) = 322.225, -16.080, and has a radius of 24.559 +/- 0.040
degrees.  The center line of this annulus lies approximately 28
arcseconds from the optical transient reported by Fox et al. (GCN
1470).  Further refinements to this triangulation are possible.  This
localization is consistent with, and constrains, the HETE WXM error
circle; although it does not constrain the HETE SXC position, it serves
as a good calibration for the IPN, which should ultimately allow us to
constrain systematic uncertainties.

A map will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020813.
