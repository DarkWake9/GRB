TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1011
SUBJECT: IPN TRIANGULATION OF GRB010324

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and C. Guidorzi, E. Montanari,
and F. Frontera, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed GRB010324, reported in
the GCN/RXTE ASM BURST POSITION NOTICE.  The triangulation
annulus is 8' wide, and is almost parallel to the long side
of the RXTE ASM error box.  The error box is fully contained
within the annulus, though, so the annulus does not reduce its
area.  However, these two observations confirm that the event
observed by RXTE is indeed a GRB.  The annulus probably cannot
be refined substantially.
