A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), F. Aceituno (IAA-CSIC),
C.C. Thoene (IAA-CSIC), L. Izzo (Uroma1), Z. Cano (U. Iceland) report:

We observed the field of GRB 160314A (Dâ€™Elia et al., GCN 19182) with the 1.5 m 
Telescope at the Sierra Nevada Observatory, starting at 19:07 UT (7.57 hr after the
burst). Observations were performed under non-optimal conditions, being affected 
by passing clouds. In a 5x300s exposure obtained in R-band we do not detect 
the optical counterpart candidate (Siegel et al, GCN 19187) down to a 3-sigma 
limiting magnitude of R ~ 21.0, as compared to USNO-B1.0 stars.
