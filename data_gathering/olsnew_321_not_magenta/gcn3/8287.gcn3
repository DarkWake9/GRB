P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) and S. Immler (CRESST/GSFC/UMD) report on behalf of 
the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of the GRB candidate, BAT trigger number 
325707 (Immler et al., GCN Circ. 8285), with settled exposures starting 
78s after the trigger. We do not find any new source in the UVOT 
observations inside the BAT error circle (Immler et al., GCN Circ. 8285) 
or anywhere in the UVOT field of view. We note that the field is very 
crowded, and no observations were made in the white band filter due to the 
presence of a bright star in the field of view.

The 5-sigma upper limits in the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. 
2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) for detecting a source in the first v finding chart 
exposure and subsequent co-added exposures from the first orbit of 
observations are:

uvw2     574     734    58.4	> 17.7

The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.39 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
