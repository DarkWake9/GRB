The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analyzed data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L), and Virgo (V) around the time of the binary
black hole merger candidate G298936 (GCNs 21656 and 21661) taking into
account our current understanding of calibration uncertainties.

Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference (Veitch et al.,
PRD 91, 042003) and a new sky map, LALInference_r1.fits.gz, can be
retrieved from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G298936

This is the preferred sky map at this time.

The new localization is consistent with but slightly smaller than the
BAYESTAR localization using HLV data (GCN 21661, bayestar-HLV.fits.gz).
The 50% area has decreased from 277 to 207 deg2 and the 90% area has
decreased from 1219 to 952 deg2. The all-sky, marginalized luminosity
distance estimate is 1738 +/- 477 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation), largely consistent with the original estimate.
