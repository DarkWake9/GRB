M. De Pasquale (INAF-Palermo) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Analyzing XRT data of the X-ray source at the position of the iPTF14cva transient
(De Pasquale, GCN Circ. 16428) from 37.6 to 367.3 ks after the trigger, we found
that this source is fading with a decay slope of 1.32 (+0.18, -0.15). We therefore
confirm that this source is the X-ray afterglow of the GRB associated with this
transient.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020387.
