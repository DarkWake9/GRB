(UCSC) report:

"We obtained a 5x1800 sec dithered exposures of the optical candidate (GCN
3465) of GRB 050525 with GMOS on the Gemini-North telescope starting at
2005 May 25.43 UT.  We measure a redshift of z = 0.606, which we assume to
be the redshift of the host galaxy, based on [O III] 5007 and H beta
emission and Ca H&K and Ca I 4228 absorption.  There is perhaps very faint
[O II] emission. Further analysis is underway.

This notice may be cited."
