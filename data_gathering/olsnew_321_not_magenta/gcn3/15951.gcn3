V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) and J. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) report:

XRT began observing GRB140311B (Racusin et al. GCN 15945) 55 minutes  
after the trigger.

Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright uncatalogued X ray  
source located at RA,Dec = 252.3242, 52.7240 which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) =  16 49 17.81
DEC (J2000.0) =  +52 43 26.4

with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This  
location is 109.6 arcsec from the BAT position, inside the BAT error  
circle.

This is an official product of the Swift/XRT team.
