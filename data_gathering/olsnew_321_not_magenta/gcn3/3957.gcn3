TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3957
SUBJECT: WIRO observations in I of GRB 050908
DATE:    05/09/09 19:28:11 GMT
FROM:    Chris Rodgers at U of Wyoming  <crodgers@uwyo.edu>

D. Dale, R. Barlow, C. Paul, C. Rodgers, D. Allen, R. Canterna, M. Pierce
report on behalf of the Wyoming Infrared Observatory GRB Team as part of
the FUN GRB Collaboration.  We responded to GRB 050908 (GCN 3942) at
07:40:25 UT with a 2 minute I exposure and at 10:25:35 UT with a 4 minute
I exposure centered on the position of the original Swift-BAT GRB Position
under 1.5 arcsecond photometric conditions.  The source was detected in
the 2 minute I exposure in the same position reported by GCN 3943 (Torii
et al.).  Zero points were calculated using the USNO B1.0 catalogue.
