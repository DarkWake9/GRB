Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported AMON Coincidence Alert from the sub-threshold IceCube-HAWC search NuEm-200202A (GCN 26963<https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/26963.gcn3 <https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/26963.gcn3>>). The location of the potential source was visible (below the horizon) for ANTARES only part of the HAWC time transit interval (lasting 6.16 hours), from 10:48 to 14:07 (UTC) <br>

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded at the location of the source coordinates (accounting for the reported uncertainties) during a +/- 1 day time-window before and after the time transit interval considered, and over which the potential source was visible 43% of the time. <br>

ANTARES <http://antares.in2p3.fr/ <http://antares.in2p3.fr/>> is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
