report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2018-10-08T06:28:13.500 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181008A (trigger ID: HEB181008269) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (trigger number 560672873). 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 41.79 s measured from T0-28.03 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+0.10 s, is 1357.8 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 14288.3 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
