We observed the field of GRB 150728A (Krimm et al., GCN 18087) with the 
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on 
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/07 31.22 to 2015/07 31.46 UTC (64.53 to 
70.24 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.60 hours 
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For source A of Watson et al. (GCN 18096), we determine:

   r	21.26 ± 0.04
   i	20.90 ± 0.04
   z	19.43 ± 0.13

For source B of Watson et al. (GCN 18096), we determine:

   r	20.91 ± 0.04
   i	20.70 ± 0.04
   z	20.48 ± 0.31

These magnitudes are in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, 
are in the AB system, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the 
direction of the GRB.

Our source A appears to correspond to the source reported by Dichiara et 
al. (GCN 18090). If this association is correct, then there is little 
evidence for fading between observations at about 1 hour, 16-23 hours, and 
65-70 hours. This is in contrast to the suggestion of Mazaeva et al. (GCN 
18097), who suggested that source A might indeed be the fading afterglow 
on the basis of a 3-sigma non-detection at 30 hours.

Similarly, there is little evidence for fading of source B between 16-23 
hours and 65-70 hours.
