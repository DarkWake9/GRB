Using the data set from T-323 to T+963 sec from all of the telemetry,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080325 (trigger #307604)
(Vetere, et al., GCN Circ. 7512).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 277.906, 36.516 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  18h 31m 37.5s
    Dec(J2000) = +36d 30' 57.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 10%.

The mask weighted light curve has a broad FRED-like structure, with
a rise to peak within ~20 sec, followed by a gradual decay extending
out to T+200 sec. The low partial coding in the initial part of the
burst makes it difficult to distinguish between statistical and real
fluctuations.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 128.4 +- 34.2 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-29.3 to T+170.5 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.68 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
4.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+38.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
