K.L. Page, R.L.C. Starling, P.A. Evans & A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have now collected 15 ks of Swift-XRT Photon Counting mode data on the 
Fermi burst GRB 091003 (Rau, GCN Circ. 9983; McEnery, Chiang & Hanabata, 
GCN Circ. 9985), between 56 and 168 ks after the trigger. The light-curve 
is fading, with alpha = 1.02 +0.21/-0.20. We therefore confirm that the 
source given by Starling et al. in GCN Circ. 9986 and 9988 is, indeed, the 
X-ray afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
