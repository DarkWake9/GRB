The long, bright GRB 180305A (Fermi-LAT detection: Axelsson &  Bissaldi,
GCN circ. 22457; Fermi-GBM detection: Veres & von Kienlin, GCN circ. 22458;
Konus-Wind detection: Svinkin et al., GCN circ. 22461) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 09:26:09.218 UTC on 5 March 2018.
No real time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because
the real time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal) between
9:00 and 9:36.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked pulse which starts at T-0.5 sec,
peaks at T+3.4 sec and ends at T+14.6 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations measured
by the SGM data are 10.0 +- 0.8 sec and 3.88 +- 0.13 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
CGBM HV was turned off at ~T+95 sec due to entering the radiation belts,
so no CGBM data are available from that time until ~T+1300 sec.

The ground processed light curve is available at

On March 2, the CGBM on-board event data capture end time was changed from
8 sec to 512 sec, so from that time in the Event mode CGBM collects time tagged
events up to T0+512 sec, where T0 is the trigger time.

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
