report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:24:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060728 (trigger=221627).  Swift slewed immediately
to the burst.  The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec
16.694, -41.386 {01h 06m 46s, -41d 23' 10"} (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This is an 64-sec image trigger
so there is very little information in the TDRSS lightcuve. 

The XRT began taking data at 22:26:35 UT, 124 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in the
image and no prompt position is available.  We are waiting for down-linked
data to detect and determine a position for the source. 

The UVOT began observing at 22:26:31.7 UT, 121.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. 
Images have been taken in V only, not in white, due to a bright source
in the field-of-view.  Ground processing indicates an uncataloged, non-fading
source, V=16.93, 58 arcsecs from the BAT position. 

We are currently in the Malindi gap in data downlinks, so it will
be about 6 hours until we get the full data set.
