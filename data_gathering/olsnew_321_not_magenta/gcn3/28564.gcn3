report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:17:52.27 UT on 06 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201006A (trigger 623639877 / 201006054),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT and the Swift/XRT
(Gropp et al. 2020, GCN 28560). The GBM on-ground location is
consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 42
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one main spike
with a duration (T90) of about 1.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.19 s to T0+0.83 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.97 +/- 0.19 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 130 +/- 26 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.33 +/- 0.38)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.86 +/- 0.97 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
