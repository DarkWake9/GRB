D. N. Burrows (PSU), M. Capalbi (ASDC), and D. Grupe (PSU) report on behalf 
of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 051221 (Parsons et al., GCN 4363) at 
01:52:44 UT (88 s after the burst).  We find a bright, rapidly fading 
source located at:

   RA(J2000) = 21:54:48.71
   Dec(J2000) = +16:53:28.2

The estimated uncertainty is 3.5 arcseconds (90% containment radius), 
including corrections for the XRT boresight.
