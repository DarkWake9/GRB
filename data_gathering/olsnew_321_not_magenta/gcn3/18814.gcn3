and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160101A (Itoh et al. GCN Circ. 18793; Veres et al. GCN Circ. 18796) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:43:54.04 UT on 1 January 2016.  
The clear burst signal was detected by all instruments.  

The light curve of the HXM shows a multiple peak structure starting at T0-2 sec and 
ending at T0+8 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the HXM1 data is 
7.2 +- 1.3 sec (7-100 keV).  

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
