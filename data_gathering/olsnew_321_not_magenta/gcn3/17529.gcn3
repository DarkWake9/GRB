WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150302A (Lien et al.,
GCN 17526) starting at 05:44:50 UT, 134 s after the burst, under
bright moon condition. First few images were useless until ~18
minutes after the burst. Observations were performed with an
automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters,
and the exposure time was 20 s per image. We do not detect the
afterglow candidate (Fynbo et al., GCN 17527) in our images,
with a limiting magnitude of R~17.8 (calibrated to USNO B1.0)
at a mid-time of 18.9 minutes after the burst.
