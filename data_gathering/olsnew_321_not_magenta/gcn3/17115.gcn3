We wish to correct an error in our earlier report of a faint source close to GRB
141121A (Watson et al., GCN 17105). The faint source is to the WEST of the
afterglow, not to the EAST as we reported. With this correction, our earlier
report and that of Mazaeva et al. (GCN 17111) are now in agreement.

Our preliminary astrometry, based on SDSS DR9, for the afterglow is:

  08:10:40.61 +22:13:01.7 J2000

and for the fainter source:

  08:10:40.41 +22:13:01.8 J2000

This astrometry may be refined as the afterglow fades and fainter source becomes
more clearly separated.

We thank Mazaeva et al. (GCN 17111) for bringing this error to our attention.
