TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  420
SUBJECT: IPN/NFI error box for GRB991014
DATE:    99/10/15 21:58:49 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

The recently reported NFI error circle for GRB991014 (BeppoSAX MAIL
99/28) is within the IPN annulus for this burst (GCN 419).  The error
circle is slightly reduced in size by the annulus.  The corners of the
IPN/NFI error box are:

   RA(2000)          DEC(2000)
6 h 50 m 55 s    +11 o 35 ' 34 "
6 h 50 m 57 s    +11 o 36 ' 43 "
6 h 51 m 06 s    +11 o 33 ' 23 "
6 h 51 m 11 s    +11 o 35 ' 54 "

This makes it quite likely that the NFI source is indeed the X-ray
counterpart to GRB991014.  The map at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/991014/ has
been updated to show the NFI source position.
