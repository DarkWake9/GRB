report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-03-06T11:13:27.950 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190306B (trigger ID: HEB190306467) in a routine search of the data. 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 49.28 s measured from T0-3.18 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0-0.022 s, is 871 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 7360 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
