 report on behalf of the Swift team:


Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of the Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst 
GRB 210827A (James DeLaunay et al. GCN Circ. 30732), collecting a total of 12.2 ks of Photon 
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+44.4 ks and T0+257.2 ks. The uncatalogued candidate 
X-ray source (Source 3) reported in Gropp et al. (GCN Circ. 30734) faded to a count-rate of 3e-3 ct s^-1, 
thus suggesting it as the likely X-ray afterglow of GRB 210827A. The light curve can be described with 
a single power-law with a decay index alpha = 1.0 (+0.5, -0.4). 

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00021461 <https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00021461>
