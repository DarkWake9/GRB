J. Mao, Y.-X. Xin, Y. Li, J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:


We observed the afterglow of GRB 190106A with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories in the second night. The observation began at UT 12:47:01, 7th, Jan, 2019, about 23.2 hours after the trigger. We still clearly detected the source. A preliminary measurement provided a magnitude of R~19.7. We suggest other telescopes to keep on observations.
