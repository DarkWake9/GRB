TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7515
SUBJECT: GRB 080325: NIR afterglow candidate

Adria C. Updike, Brian C. Donehew, Ian Oliver, and Dieter H. Hartmann
(Clemson University) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080325 (Vetere et al., GCN 7512) with the KPNO
2.1m + FLAMINGOS in the J band beginning 5 hours and 42 minutes after the
trigger.  Within the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 7513), we
detect a source at RA = 18:31:34.185, Dec = +36:31:19.60 (+/- 2
arcseconds).

Days after trigger        Band      Magnitude
--------------------------------------------------
0.23775                    J        18.76 +/- 0.14
0.25022                    J        18.85 +/- 0.13
0.26427                    J        19.42 +/- 0.26

Magnitudes are derived relative to the 2MASS catalog.  This sequence
suggests a fading source.  Further observations are required to confirm
this detection.
