Michael J. Lundquist, David J. Sand (UA),  Wen-fai Fong, Jillian
Rastinejad, Kerry Paterson (Northwestern), Jennifer Andrews (UA), Sam Wyatt
(UA), Eric Christensen, Alex Gibbs, Frank Shelly, report on behalf of the
SAGUARO collaboration:

We initiated observations of 24 fields (each 5 deg^2, totalling 120 deg^2)
within the LVC localization region for the GW trigger S191216ap (LVC Circ
26454) starting on 2019-12-17 at 1:25 UT (3.9 hours after the GW trigger)
with the 1.5m Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ.

Below are the field centers observed.

Overall image quality was poor. We perform real-time processing and image
subtraction (described in Lundquist et al. 2019, ApJL, 881, 2). After
discarding known moving objects, stellar sources and known transients
(cross-correlating with the Transient Name Server and the ZTF alert
stream), we find no significant candidates with S/N>5, although a more
detailed analysis is ongoing.

We have posted our pointings to the Treasure Map, and encourage others to
do the same:
