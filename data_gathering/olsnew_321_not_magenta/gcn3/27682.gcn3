The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:18:33 UT on 3 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200503B (trigger 610219118.569706 / 200503721).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 250.6, Dec = -20.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 42m, -20d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 73.0 degrees.
