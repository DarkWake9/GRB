Report on behalf of the Follow-Up-Network (FUN) GRB collaboration:

We observed a 8x12 arcminute field centered on the optical afterglow (GCN
3366) of GRB 050505 discovered by Swift (GCN 3360) with the SARA 0.9 m
Telescope at KPNO. Observations were carried out under good seeing
conditions with the U55 CCD. We obtained 35 minutes of exposure in R.
Observations started at UT 05/05/06 03:03:37, and ended 03:43:43. We do
not detect the afterglow. Our R-band upper limit (1-sigma) is R(lim) =
19.7. The calibration was carried out using the USNO A2.0 catalog.
