N. Mirabal and J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) report on
behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We have observed the Swift BAT localization of
GRB 070208 (Sato et al., GCN 6074) with the
MDM 1.3m telescope starting on February 8 09:25.
Within the XRT error box, we  detect two extended
sources (also seen in the DSS plates), which should
be considered potential host galaxies for this short
burst. Observations are continuing to determine
optical variability.

This message may be cited."
