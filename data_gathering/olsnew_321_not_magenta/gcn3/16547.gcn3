We observed the field of GRB 140709A (Hagen, et al., GCN 16546) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/07 9.17 to 2014/07 9.25 UTC (2.76 to 4.78
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.42 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 0.60 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We detect no sources within the Swift-XRT error circle.  In comparison with
2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 23.39
  i > 23.20
  Z > 22.17
  Y > 21.61
  J > 21.55
  H > 21.13

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  We note that a faint, red source
is detected just outside the XRT error region at a position:

 RA, DEC = 304.661780,  51.224069 +/- 0.5" (J2000), with

  r > 23.08
  i = 22.15 +/- 0.13
  Z = 21.43 +/- 0.18
  Y > 21.25
  J = 20.90 +/- 0.20
  H = 20.76 +/- 0.25

We cannot confirm fading in this source.  We thank the staff of the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.
