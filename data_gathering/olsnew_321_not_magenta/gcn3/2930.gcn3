P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

"We observed the position of SGR 1806-20 with the Very Large Array (VLA)
in A-configuration on 2005 Jan 3.81 UT (t ~ 6.9 days after the giant
flare, GCN #2920).  We detect a radio source coincident with the X-ray
position reported by Kaplan et al. (2002, ApJ, 564, 935) at the
approximate freqeucnies and flux densities listed below.

Freq (GHz)    Flux density (mJy)
--------------------------------
1.43           164

Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation."
