We observed the localization region of the gravitational wave trigger
S190728q (GCN 25187) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the
47 square degree ZTF camera (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019). A new
tiling was automatically optimally determined and triggered using the
GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et
al. 2019b). We enclosed 64% of the probability and obtained a sequence of
300s exposures in g-band, r-band and g-band before sunrise.

The images were processed through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction
pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019).
We applied standard filtering criterion including rejecting stellar sources
(Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects and applying machine
learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019, Duev et al. 2019).

A promising candidate with the first detection after the GW merger time and
a fast intra-night rise in both filters is:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ZTF Name     | RA (deg)    | DEC (deg)   | Filter | Mag   |  Magerr |
Filter | Mag   | Magerr
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZTF19abjethn  | 326.395431 | 20.690590    | r      | 19.65 |  0.11   | g
  | 19.82 |  0.16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We reported this candidate to TNS and it was given the name AT2019lvs. The
candidate is offset from a galaxy with SDSS phot-z estimate of 0.228 Â±
0.0286. We serendipituously observed this field the previous night with ZTF
and did not detect the candidate.

Additional analysis and continued follow-up is in progress and encouraged.
