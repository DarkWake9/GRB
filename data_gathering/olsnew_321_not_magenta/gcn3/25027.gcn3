P. S. Marrocchesi (U of Siena), A. Yoshida, T. Sakamoto, V. Pal'shin,
S. Sugita (AGU), Y. Kawakubo (LSU), K. Yamaoka (Nagoya U), 
S. Nakahira (RIKEN), Y. Asaoka, S. Ozawa, S. Torii (Waseda U),
Y. Shimizu, T. Tamura (Kanagawa U), N. Cannady (GSFC/UMBC), 
M. L. Cherry (LSU), S. Ricciarini (U of Florence),
and the CALET collaboration:


At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190706ai,
T0 = 2019-07-06 22:26:41.345 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24998), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-15 min to 
T0+12 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy
trigger mode at the trigger time of S190706ai, but the CAL FOV 
does not have any overlap with the LVC high probability localization 
region.  The CAL FOV was centered at RA= 210.4 deg, DEC = -45.4 deg
at T0.
