The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:


IceCube has performed a search [1] for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-Cascade 220625A (GCN Notice: https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_icecube_cascade/136768_63259630.amon and ATel 15472 https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15472)

in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2022-06-25 14:06:18.530 UTC to 2022-06-25 14:22:58.530 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-Cascade 220625A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 220625A ranges from 1.4e-01 to 2.1e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 3e+02 GeV and 1e+06 GeV.


A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2022-06-24 14:14:38.530 UTC to 2022-06-26 14:14:38.530 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 0.58, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 220625A ranges from 1.6e-01 to 2.0e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>.
