Markku Nissinen (Taurus Hill Observatory) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus
Hill Observatory) report:


We used 0.35m C14 XLT telescope with SBIG ST-8XME CCD at Taurus Hill Observatory
(Varkaus, Finland) for follow-up observations of GRB090424. The observations 
were started on April 24, at 19:59 UTC (5.8 hours after the burst) and stopped
on April 24, at 23:11 UTC. Sixteen unfiltered 600 seconds images were taken. 
We detected clear optical afterglow object at the position of RA 12h 38m 05s.12 and DEC 
+16o 50' 15".2 with respect to POSSII F/USNO-B1.0 which is in good correlation 
with enhanced Swift XRT-UVOT position. Upper limit for the observations is >20.4 mag.
Quoted upper limit has been derived using POSSII F and USNO-B1.0 field stars 
as reference.
