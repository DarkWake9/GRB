TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4209
SUBJECT: GRB051105B: Swift/UVOT upper limit
DATE:    05/11/08 01:48:53 GMT
FROM:    Alexander Blustin at MSSL-UCL  <ajb@mssl.ucl.ac.uk>

A. J. Blustin (UCL-MSSL), S. Campana (OAB/ASDC), J. Nousek (PSU),
N. White (GSFC), N. Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 051105B on
2005-11-05 at 11:05:50 UT, ~2.25 days after the INTEGRAL trigger
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 4192). No new source with respect to the
DSS is observed within the 2 arcminute radius IBAS error circle
in coadded V-band exposures down to the following 5-sigma
magnitude upper limit:

Filter  T_range(days)  Exp(sec)  5sigUL
V       2.25-2.38      4932      20.4

We note that there was a high image background in the region of
the IBIS error circle due to the presence of a Vmag=9 star within
it (as mentioned by Torii, GCN 4193).
