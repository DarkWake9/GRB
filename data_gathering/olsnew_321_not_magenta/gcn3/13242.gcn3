K.L. Page, R.L.C. Starling, P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), S.R. Oates
(MSSL-UCL) and T. Sakamoto (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT and UVOT teams:

We have analysed 2.0 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst GRB
120419A (Gotz et al., GCN Circ. 13241), from 25.6 ks to 32.3 ks after
the INTEGRAL trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. There is a faint source detected within the INTEGRAL error circle
at a position of RA, Dec = 187.38762, -63.00791, which is equivalent to


RA (J2000): 12h 29m 33.03s
Dec(J2000): -63d 00' 28.5"

with an uncertainty of 4.5". This position is 40.7" from the
INTEGRAL position. The source count rate is 0.0079 +/- 0.0033 count
s^-1; we cannot determine whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020215.

The UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 120419A
25.7 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger. No optical afterglow, consistent
with either the INTEGRAL position or with the candidate X-ray position
given above, is detected in the initial UVOT exposures. Preliminary
3-sigma upper limit using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al.
2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the initial exposure is:

Filter T_start(s) T_stop(s)  Exp(s)  Mag

u      25697      26908      1191    >20.5

The magnitude in the table is not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the large but uncertain reddening in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT and UVOT teams.
