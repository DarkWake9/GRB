R. Martone, C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Cucchiara, D. Morris (U. of Virgin Islands) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

We observed Swift GRB 181022A (Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 23364) with the LCO 1-m unit at Sutherland on October 22, from 22:20 to 22:51 UT (about 5 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS i' filter. Within the enhanced Swift-XRT error circle (Marshall et al. GCN Circ. 23364) we do not detect any source down to iâ€™>19.0 mag from a 10x120s exposure at a mid time of about 5.05 hours after the GRB trigger time, as calibrated against nearby USNOB1 objects.
