Subject: GRB 130803A: Fermi GBM observation

Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:02:53.75 UT on 03 Aug 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130803A (trigger 397216976 / 130803419),
which was also detected by the Swift BAT and XRT (Page et al. 2013,
GCN 15059). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift
position. The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse,
with a duration (T90) of about 7.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.0 s to T0+4.9 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power-law index is -0.85 +/- 0.09 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 141.6 +/- 12.2 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.5 +/- 0.1)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 7.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
