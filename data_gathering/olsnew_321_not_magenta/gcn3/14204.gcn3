C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 01:31:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130215A (trigger=548760).  Swift did not slew because of Moon constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 43.479, +13.371 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 53m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 22' 14"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 14:00 UT on 2013 February 18. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
