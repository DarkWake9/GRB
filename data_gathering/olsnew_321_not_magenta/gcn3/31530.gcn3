The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:57:30 UT on 29 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220129A (trigger 665182655.40502 / 220129873).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 244.4, Dec = 2.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 17m, 2d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 22.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 16.0 degrees.
