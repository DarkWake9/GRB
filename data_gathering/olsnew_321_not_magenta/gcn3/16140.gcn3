D. Xu (DARK/NBI) reports:

The photometry of the NOT SDSS r-band data in GCN 16138 has been
refined. The detected object is not point-like but somewhat extended
in the NOT image. The photometry in GCN 16138 only covers a seemingly
bright part of the extended object. If the whole object is covered,
the brightness changes to m(R)=21.60+/-0.20 calibrated with the same
nearby SDSS stars, which now is consistent with the decaying law
derived from pre- and post-NOT observations (e.g., from RATIR; GCN
16139).

We thank Antonino Cucchiara for pointing out the difference in magnitudes.
