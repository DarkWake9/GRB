N. Gehrels (GSFC) & M. Perri (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift team

Based on its high redshift, relatively bright optical afterglow and
variable X-ray afterglow, the Swift team declares GRB 090205
to be a burst of interest to be followed by Swift as long as
detectable.  We encourage ground-based follow-ups.  Please
post your results / plans or send us informal information to
help with observation planning.
