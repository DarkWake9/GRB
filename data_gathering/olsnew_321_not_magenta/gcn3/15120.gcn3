(PSU), V. Mangano (PSU), M.C. Stroh (PSU), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), C.
Pagani (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo
(INAF-OAB) and D. Kocevski report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.2 ks of XRT data for GRB 130822A (Kocevski  et al.
GCN Circ. 15112),  from 85 s to 41.0 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT
position for this burst was given by Beardmore et al. (GCN. Circ
15117). The source is fading with alpha >0.5.


If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of ,
the count rate at T+24 hours will be 2.8 x 10^-5 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
