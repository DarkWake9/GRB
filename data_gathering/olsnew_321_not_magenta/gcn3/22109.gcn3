Using INTEGRAL we have performed a search for a prompt gamma-ray
counterpart of the cosmic neutrino candidate IceCube-171106A
(GCN 22105).

At the time of the event (2017-11-06 18:39:39 UTC, hereafter T0),
INTEGRAL was operating in nominal mode. The peak of the neutrino
localization probability was at an angle of 44 deg with respect to
the spacecraft pointing axis. This orientation implies strongly
suppressed response of ISGRI and IBIS/Veto, and somewhat suppressed
response of SPI-ACS.

The background within +/-300 seconds around the event was very
stable.Â  We do not detect any significant counterparts and estimate
a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 2.7e-07 erg/cm^2
for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB
spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with alpha=-0.5 and
Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s
around T0.

For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1,
beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived peak flux upper limit is
~3e-07 (8.6e-07) erg/cm^2/s at 1 s (8 s) time scale in 75-2000 keV
energy range.
