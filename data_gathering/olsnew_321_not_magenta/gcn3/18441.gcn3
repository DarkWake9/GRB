E. Klunko (ISTP), E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), I. Korobtsev 
(ISTP),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 151022A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 18436) 
with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting on Oct. 22 
(UT) 15:05:04. We obtained several images in R-filter of 30 s exposure. 
    Within XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 18438)  we do not detect any 
optical source in any single image. Upper limit (3 sigma) of a single 
image is R ~ 19.4m. Photometry is based on nearly USNO-B1.0 (R2) stars.
