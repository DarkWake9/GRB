D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), S. Shaw, N. Mowlavi, M. Beck, S. 
Soldi (ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

A 40 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:05:56 
on July 14 2005.
Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  43.5863 [degrees]
DEC: +69.1261 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.3 
ph (2.6E-08 erg)/cmsq/s. Its fluence (20-200 keV, 40 s integration time) 
is 6.16E-07 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
