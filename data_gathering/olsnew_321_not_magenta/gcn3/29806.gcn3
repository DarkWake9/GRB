We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 210411C (Sbarrato et al., GCN 
29794) using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter 
spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and 
consist of 4 exposures by 1200 s each (8x600 s in the NIR). The 
observation mid time was 2021 Apr 12.33 UT (16.9 hr after the GRB).

In a 60 s image taken with the acquisition camera on Apr 12.294 UT, we 
detect the optical afterglow, for which we measure an AB magnitude r = 
21.69 +- 0.04 (calibrated against nearby stars from the SkyMapper 
catalog; Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, 35, 010; 
https:doi.org/10.4225/41/593620ad5b574).

We clearly detect continuum over the wavelength range 3520 - 17500 AA. A 
trough is visible around 4650 AA, which we identify as due to H I. From 
the detection of several narrow absorption features, which we interpret 
as due to, among others, Si II, Si II*, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II, 
Al II, we infer a redshift z = 2.826. We also identify the FeII* 2396 
fine-structure transition, though at low S/N.

We acknowledge excellent support from the observing staff at Paranal, in 
particular Eleonora Sani and Bin Yang.
