The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:23:22 UT on 23 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211223B (trigger 661940607.257526 / 211223350).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 287.6, Dec = 42.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 10m, 42d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.0 degrees.
