report:

"We have taken R- and I-band images of the optical afterglow
reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 3193) of the
HETE-2 GRB 050408 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 3189) at the
1.2m Mercator Telescope at La Palma.

The R-band observation started at 20:56 UT and consisted of
3 x 5m, 1 x 3m and 1 x 8m exposure time, making the
total exposure time 26 minutes, with midpoint 4.82h after burst.
The I-band observation started at 21:30 UT and consisted of
2 x 5 minutes exposure time, with midpoint 5.22h after burst.
We calibrate our photometry using the USNO-B catalogue values.
We find an R-band magnitude of 21.25 +/- 0.2 and a
I-band magnitude of 20.4 +/- 0.3.

We thank the staff of the Mercator Telescope for the
excellent assistance."
