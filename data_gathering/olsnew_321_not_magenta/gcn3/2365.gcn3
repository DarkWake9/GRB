D.B. Fox and M.P. Hunt (Caltech) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO
GRB Collaboration:  

"We have observed the HETE-2 SXC localization region for GRB030823
with the 200-inch Hale Telescope and Large-Format Camera on
Mt. Palomar on August 24.15 and August 25.23 UT.  Our dithered 4x300s
images cover the full localization region on each night at mean epochs
of 0.78 and 1.86 days after the burst, respectively.  PSF-matched
image subtraction reveals no bright, variable sources within the SXC
error box.  We therefore derive a limit of R>22.5 on the brightness of
any variable optical counterpart at the epoch of our first
observation."
