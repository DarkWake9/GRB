report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:43:26.23 UT on 22 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
 Monitor triggered and located GRB 081122B
(trigger  249057807 / 081122614).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 151.4, DEC = -2.1 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 10 h 06 m, -02 d 06 '), with an uncertainty
of 11.2 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 52 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows this is a short burst with a
single spike of duration (T90) of about 0.3 s (50 - 300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.13 s to T0+0.13 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.5 +/- 0.1
(chi squared 372 for 484 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (50 - 300 keV) in this time interval is
(7.9 +/- 0.1)E-8 erg/cm^2. The 256 ms photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.128 s in the 50 - 300 keV band
is 1.6 +/- 0.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
