Using the data set from T-239 to T+584 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071003 (trigger #292934)
(Schady, et al., GCN Circ. 6837).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 301.857, 10.954 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 20h 07m 25.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = 10d 57' 16" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 34%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a strong first peak with multiple
overlapping subpeaks starting at ~T-20sec, peaking at T+0 sec, and ending
at ~T+55 sec.  The second, much weaker peak starts at ~T+130 sec, peaks at
~T+145 sec, and ends at ~T+220 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 150 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.6 to T+167.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.36 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.37 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
