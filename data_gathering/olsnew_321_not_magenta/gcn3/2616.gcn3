We have observed the 6 sq. degrees field around INTEGRAL GRB 040624
with MASTER system (355 mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru).
  We have 15 unfiltered images of the error box (30s and 60s  expositions)
started at 24 June 2004	19:37:06 UT (after 0,48 day GRB 040624
time).
The limiting magnitude on the each image was about 15m under very bad
weather conditions.

There is no  OT at error circle
as reported by INTEGRAL GCN2613.
