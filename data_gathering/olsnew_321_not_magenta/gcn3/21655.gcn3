Vicki Toy (UMD) report:

We observed the field of GRB 170822A (Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 21640) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/08 23.44 to 2017/08 23.48 UTC (25.45
to 26.38 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.69 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.30 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the USNO-B1 
and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r	> 23.37
 i	> 22.87
 Z	> 21.99
 Y	> 21.56
 J	> 21.28
 H	> 20.82

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The bright but rapidly-fading optical transient reported by Tello et al. 
(GCN Circ. 21642) is not seen in our images.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
