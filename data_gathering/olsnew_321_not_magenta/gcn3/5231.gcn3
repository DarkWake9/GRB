Using the data set from T-119.9 to T+182.2 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060605 (trigger #213630) 
(Page, et al., GCN #5221).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
(RA,Dec) = 322.157, -6.046 deg {21h 28m 37.6s, -6d 2' 44.7"} (J2000)
+- 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding 
was 87%.

The light curve shows two overlapping FRED peaks of similar size. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is 15 +- 2 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.5 to T+15.0 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.34 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
4.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T+1.67 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
