The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:57:20 UT on 1 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200201A (trigger 602211445.321872 / 200201040).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 287.7, Dec = -11.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 10m, -11d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54.0 degrees.
