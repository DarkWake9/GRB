D. Malesani (DARK), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire), J. P. U. Fynbo, 
J. Hjorth, B. Milvang-Jensen (DARK), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We further inspected our images and spectra (Jakobsson et al., GCN 7757) 
of the afterglow of GRB 080520 (Grupe et al., GCN 7753). A faint 
extension is visible in our images (seeing 0.7") underlying the 
afterglow emission, which may be due to a relatively bright host galaxy. 
This is consistent with the 2D trace of the spectrum, which reveals the 
proposed [O II] line to be also spatially extended.

Using the relations by Kennicutt (1998, ARA&A, 36, 189), the flux of the 
[O II] line (not corrected for extinction) corresponds to a star 
formation rate (SFR) of approximately 15 M_Sun/yr.
