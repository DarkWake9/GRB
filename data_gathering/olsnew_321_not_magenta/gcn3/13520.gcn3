A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Sergeev (Institute of Radio Astronomy of NASU), A. 
Volnova (SAI MSU), O. Burhonov (UBAI), I. Molotov (KIAM) report on behalf 
GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed  the field of Swift  GRB 120724A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 13510) 
with AZT-22 telescope of Maidanak observatory starting on Jul. 24 (UT) 
15:55:51 under mean seeing (FWHM) of about 1.1 arcsec. Totally we obtained 4 
images of 600 s exposure in R  filter. At the edge of the enhanced XRT 
position (Goad et al., GCN 13515) we detected the object with coordinates 
(J2000) 16 20 43.28  +03 30 27.1 (uncertainty of  0.12 arcsec in both 
coordinates), which is slightly apart from coordinates of the OT reported 
earlier (Guidorzi  et al., GCN 13511; Holland et al., GCN 13516).  Since the 
object is also visible in stacked DSS images (R+I) we suggest it is a 
possible host galaxy of GRB 120724A.

A preliminary photometry of the object is based on USNO-B1.0 nearby stars:

T0+        Filter,     Exposure,   OT
