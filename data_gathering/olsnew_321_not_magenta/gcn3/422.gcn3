TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  422
SUBJECT: GRB 991014, optical observations
DATE:    99/10/16 02:52:06 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

The U.S. Naval Observatory GRB team (A.A. Henden, F.J. Vrba, B.
Canzian, C.B. Luginbuhl, S.E. Levine, H.H. Guetter, J.A. Munn), D.H.
Hartmann (Clemson Univ.), M.C. Jennings (IGPP, UCR visitor)

report a BVRcIc photometry file for the northern half of
the WFI error box of GRB 991014.  This file can be found at:
  ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb991014.dat
One marginal photometric night with a wide variety of
Landolt standards having large color and airmass differences was used.
Typical zero point errors are 0.02mag, to be added to the Poisson
errors reported in the file.  All stars brighter than V=14 are
saturated and should be ignored.  We intend to observe additional
nights in November to further calibrate this field, and will
update the file accordingly.
  The team also acquired I-band photometry with the 1.55-m
telescope of the NFI error box, and R-band photometry with
the 1.0-m telescope of the entire WFI error box, from about
991015 1030 UT until 1230 UT.  Due to the Huntsville GRB
meeting, this data is being slowly analyzed by a shrunken
staff.  It is clear again tonight (991016 UT) and additional
R-band photometry with the 1.0-m of the NFI error box is scheduled.
