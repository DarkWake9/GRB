The long-duration 160607A (Swift-BAT trigger #689597:
Ukwatta et al., GCN 19502; Lien et al., GCN 19506)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=40436.923 s UT (11:13:56.923).

The burst light curve shows a complex structure of multiple peaks
with a total duration of ~38 s.
The emission is seen up to ~15 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 4.12(-0.51,+0.64)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+11.952 s,
of 8.13(-1.59,+1.64)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+38.912 s)
is best fit in the 70 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.68(-0.43,+1.47),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.51(-0.35,+0.26),
the peak energy Ep = 176(-42,+25) keV,
chi2 = 84/76 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate
(measured from T0+8.448 to T0+14.336 s)
is best fit in the 70 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.68(-0.31,+0.39),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.76(-0.37,+0.23),
the peak energy Ep = 188(-17,+17) keV,
chi2 = 56/74 dof.
