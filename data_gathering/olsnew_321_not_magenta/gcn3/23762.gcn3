S. V. Cherukuri (IIST), V. Jaiswal (IIST), K. Misra (ARIES),  L. Resmi (IIST), S. Schulze (WIS) and A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration :

We observed the field of GRB 190114C (Gropp et al. GCN 23688, Hamburg et al. GCN 23707) with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at a mean frequency of 1.26GHz on 17th Jan 2019 13.44 UT (2.8 days after burst).  At the position of the JVLA radio afterglow (Alexander et al., GCN 23726), we report a weak detection of 73+/-17 micro Jy.  The measurement is not corrected for host which is detected in the pre-explosion images obtained with MeerKAT (Tremou et al.  GCN 23760).  The data were reduced using the customised CASA pipeline presented in Ishwara-Chandra et al. (2019).  Further observations are planned.  

We thank the staff of the GMRT for making these observations possible. GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
