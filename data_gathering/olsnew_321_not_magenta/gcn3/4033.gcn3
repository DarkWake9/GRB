We report a correction to Hullinger et al. (GCN circ. 4019).  There
are two additional peaks in the interval T+260 to T+275 sec besides 
the broader, somewhat more intense peaks reported earlier.  We had 
mistakenly stated that there was no emission after T+120.  We have 
no mask-weighted data from T+300 to T+330 sec, but the raw rates show 
no peaks in this interval.  There is no significant emission after 
T+330 sec; in particular, there does not seem to be any emission in 
the BAT energy range at the times of the Xray flares reported by Godet 
et al. (GCN circ. 4031).

The two later peaks are softer, shorter, and sharper.  The total
fluence from T+0 to T+300 sec is (2.6 +- 0.4) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2 in the 
15-150 keV band.  The power-law photon index for the total burst is 
2.1 +- 0.2.  T90 is 250 +- 20 sec.  Errors are 90% confidence 
including systematics.
