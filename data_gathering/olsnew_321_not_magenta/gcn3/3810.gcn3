DATE:    05/08/15 12:10:52 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol (University of
Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 050730 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at Aug 13 10.57 UT to 21.88 UT,
i.e. 12.61 - 13.08 days after the burst (GCN 3704).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the source in GCN 3761.
At the position of the source we measure a formal flux of 22 +/- 38
microJy."
