on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and RHESSI observed this GRB
(GCN1706) at 64710 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately  30 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
8.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  7.8E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 111. sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  19 h 47 m 42.76 s     28 o 17 '   8.06 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 19 h 46 m 49.27 s     28 o  9 '  14.20 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 19 h 47 m 47.73 s     28 o 13 '   9.68 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 19 h 47 m 37.78 s     28 o 21 '   6.43 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 19 h 48 m 36.40 s     28 o 25 '   0.85 " 

Assuming that the INTEGRAL-IBIS localization is a circle
with 30 arcminute radius, this error box lies entirely
within it and reduces its area by a factor of about 25.

An image will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/021125.

This error box may be improved.
