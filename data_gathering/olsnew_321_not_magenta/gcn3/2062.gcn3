Report on behalf of the University of Wyoming GRB response team and the
FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329, identified in Torii (GCN
1986), in the Johnson V filter with the RBO 0.6m telescope at Red Buttes
Wyoming.  We obtained 25, 300s exposures.  Observations were undertaken
between 02:26UT and 6:00UT, on March 31st.  The observations were carried
out under fair seeing conditions.  Aperture photometry was performed and
calibrated utilizing the standards reported by Henden et al., (GCN 2023).
We initially measured the magnitude of the OT to be V=16.71, which faded
by 0.15 mag during our observational period; however, there appeared to be
a brightening.  Errors were on average +/- 0.018.  

Further aperture photometry is being performed and observations are
planned.
