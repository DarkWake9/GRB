A. Pozanenko (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), S. 
Belkin (IKI)  report   on behalf of IKI-FuN:

We observed the field of  the GRB  190114B (Siegel et al., GCN 23686)  with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy).   We started observations 
on Jan. 14 (UT) 20:28:30, i.e. 57 minutes   after burst trigger.   Within 
the enhanced XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 23691) we detect the object 
which is absent in SDSS catalog. Coordinates of the object are (J2000) 
11:39:29.84 +18:53:27.8 with uncertainty 0.5 arcsec in both coordinates. The 
brightens of the object is R ~ 20.1m at (UT) 20:28:30. We suggest the object 
is the afterglow of GRB  190114B. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS 
DR12 stars, Lupton transformation.
