report on behalf of the MASTER Team:

MASTER-Amur  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB160104A (Melandri et 
al., GCN 18815) 10 sec after notice time and 32 sec after trigger time
at 2016-01-04 11:24:46 UT. On our first (10s exposure)  set we have
found optical transient  with 17.0+/-0.3 unfiltered magnitude at LCOGT-FTN 
and 
MITSuME Akeno position (Guidorzi et al., GCN 18816; Saito et al., GCN 18817)
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.3 mag

MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru)
located near Bykal lake  was pointed to the  GRB160104A 66 sec after 
trigger time at 2016-01-04 11:25:20 UT. On our first (10s exposure)  set 
we have found marginally optical transient  ~17 unfiltered magnitude.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.2mag

The reduction is continuated.
