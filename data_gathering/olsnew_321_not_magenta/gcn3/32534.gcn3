A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

E. Bozzo and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 220903A
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 683900183),
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT), so far,
at about 44178 s UT (12:16:18).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   178.795 (11h 55m 11s) -29.705 (-29d 42' 17")
  Corners:
   176.905 (11h 47m 37s) -30.818 (-30d 49' 04")
   177.561 (11h 50m 15s) -31.150 (-31d 09' 02")
   180.605 (12h 02m 25s) -28.545 (-28d 32' 44")
   179.962 (11h 59m 51s) -28.232 (-28d 13' 54")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2.32 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 3.94 deg (the minimum one is 37.6 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 39 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of,
the Fermi-GBM final localization (glg_healpix_all_bn220903511_v01).

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
