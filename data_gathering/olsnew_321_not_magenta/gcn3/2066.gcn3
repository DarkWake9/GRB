We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 with the 20in 
Morris W. Offit telescope
of the Maryland Space Grant Consortium Observatory. The telescope is 
located in
downtown Baltimore, Maryland and the observations were made with a 
student built
CCD camera on the night of March 31st / morning of April 1st with an 
R-band filter.

Aperture photometry was made with APPHOT in a 20 arcsec diameter 
aperture with
errors empirically estimated from the background noise. The photometry 
is
computed by assuming the USNO reference star at RA 10 44 42.01 DEC +21 
32 31.8
has constant magnitude R=16.2 but counts were consistent from run to run
indicating near-photometric conditions.

The GRB appeared to brighten suddenly between ~02:30 and ~03:30 by 0.5 
mags and then fade
slowly for the next few hours.

The error on the reference star was +/- 0.07 which should be added in 
quadrature to
the above table.

(Note star 1 is off the nominal R=14.00 value which we attribute to 
non-linearity in the CCD)

This photometry is preliminary, further analysis is proceeding. The
