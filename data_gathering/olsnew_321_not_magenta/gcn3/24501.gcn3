K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL), B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and
A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 14:40:09 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190512A (trigger=903357).  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 82.440, -7.574 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 29m 46s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 34' 25"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a FRED-profile
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 18:41 UT on 2019 July 21. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. G. Bernardini (grazia.bernardini AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
