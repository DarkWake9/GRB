report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:14:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060501 (trigger=208050).  Swift did not slew due to the
earth-observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 328.367, +43.983 {21h 53m 28s, +43d 58' 59"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows single roughly triangular
shaped peak starting at T-5 sec and ending at ~T+20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze.
