J. Vinko (Konkoly/ELTE/U Szeged), A. Ordasi (Konkoly), L. Kriskovics (Konkoly), R. Szakats (Konkoly) and A. Pal (Konkoly) report on behalf of the "Transient Astrophyical Objects" project:

We observed the field of GRB 200324A (Dichiara et al. GCN 27428; Beardmore et al., GCN
27430; Stecklum et al. GCN 27431; Fynbo et al. GCN 27432) with the 0.8m RC80 robotic telescope
at Piszkesteto Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory through SDSS r' filter on 2020 March 24.88 UT   
(MJD 58932.885, 4h 36m after the trigger). The total exposure time was 1800 s. The frames were tied
to PS1-photometry of local stellar sources. No optical counterpart for the GRB has been detected 
above the 3-sigma upper limit of 21.7 AB-mag, which is consistent with other reports of non-detection.
