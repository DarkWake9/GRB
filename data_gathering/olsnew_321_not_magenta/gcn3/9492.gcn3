N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

On 2009 June 07 at 06:01:12 UT we observed the Swift-BAT GRB 090607
(Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 9491) with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North.

Observations started 31 minutes after the BAT trigger time and were
performed using the B, V, R and i' filters. We could not find any
uncatalogued object inside the XRT error circle down to the following
limiting magnitudes:

Time Interval   Total Exp  Filter     Limit
(min from GRB)  (s)                  (mag)
-------------------------------------------
31 - 82          720        R        > 21.8
35 - 75          520        i'       > 21.6
-------------------------------------------

Magnitudes in the R and i' filters have been calibrated against
nearby field stars using USNOB1-R2 and SDSS-i catalogue values,
respectively.
