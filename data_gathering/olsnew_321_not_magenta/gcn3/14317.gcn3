P.A. Evans report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 10 ks of XRT data for GRB 130315A (Evans  et al. GCN
Circ. 14311),  from 167 s to 29.4 ks after the	BAT trigger. The data
comprise 337 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec =
157.54687, -51.79362 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 10 30 11.25
Dec(J2000): -51 47 37.0

with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=.

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.49 (+/-0.04). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.88 (+0.19, -0.18) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 2.3 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.1 (+/-0.3) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 3.1 (+1.2, -0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.9 x 10^-11 (6.7 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.1 (+1.2, -0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.3 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.1 (+/-0.3)
