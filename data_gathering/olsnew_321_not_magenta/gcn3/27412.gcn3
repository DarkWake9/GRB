The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:35:27 UT on 18 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200318A (trigger 606263732.221512 / 200318941).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 123.4, Dec = 59.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 13m, 59d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 14.0 degrees.
