C. Meegan (NASA/MSFC) and J. Greiner (MPE) report for the
GLAST Burst Monitor team:


"Effective immediately, the GBM team will begin issuing GCN circulars
for triggered gamma-ray bursts.  These will include human-in-the-loop
localizations and, for bright GRBs, spectral results.  Burst triggers
occur approximately once per day.  The latency will be up to 1 or 2 days
initially, dropping to a few hours over the next 3-4 weeks.  We expect
to begin sending automatically generated notices in a few weeks, after
an update to the flight software is loaded and tested.  These will
include flight software generated classifications and localizations,
and ground automated localizations".
