Watson (UNAM) report:

We observed 26 nearby galaxies (D<10 Mpc) within the GWGC catalog (White,
et al. 2011) and also contained with the LIGO/Virgo G194575 1-sigma
confidence interval (Singer, et al. GCN 18442) between RA 23.1 hours and RA
1.5 hours (J2000) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astron칩mico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro M치rtir on the night
of 2015/10/23.

We obtained a total exposure of 8 minutes on each field, reaching typical
depths of r and i = 21 mag, and z = 17 mag (10-sigma).  These magnitudes
are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.  Each
field, centered upon one GWGC galaxy, has a size of approximately 5 by 5
arcmin^2.  Analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astron칩mico Nacional in San Pedro
M치rtir.

Continued observations are planned.
