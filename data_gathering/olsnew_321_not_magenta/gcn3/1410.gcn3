P.A. Price, B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) and T.S. Axelrod (Steward Obs, 
Arizona) report:

We have observed the error-box of GRB 020603 (Hurley et al., GCN #1409)
with the robotic 50-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory,
commencing at 2002 June 5.69 UT.  Exposures consisted of 3x300 sec
integrations in MACHO_R, and cover the entire error box to a limiting
magnitude of R ~ 19 mag.  We do not find any optical afterglow candidate
within the error box on visual comparison with the second Digitised Sky
Survey.
