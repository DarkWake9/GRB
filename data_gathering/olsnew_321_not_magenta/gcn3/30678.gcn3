During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight
by a long bright burst, GRB 210822A, at 2021-08-22T09:18:18.00 UTC
(denoted as T0), which is also observed by Swift/BAT (GCN #30677).
Its alert data was downlinked to the ground through the
short message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 30-1000 keV
from BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of multiple
pulses with a duration of about 15 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

An automatic localization was calculated using the light curves and 
spectrum,
and the GECAM location is consistent with the Swift/BAT position within 
the error.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
