For GRB lovers, on S. Valentine's day:
 
On Feb.14 at 01:01:01 a GRB (GRB000214)  has been detected by the GRBM and
WFC1 of BeppoSAX.

Preliminary coordinates from WFC are:

R.A.(2000)= 283.573
DEC(2000)= -66.455

The attitude configuration at the time of the GRB introduces a systematic
error in the position. At this stage of the analysis we estimate a total
error of about 8' in radius.
