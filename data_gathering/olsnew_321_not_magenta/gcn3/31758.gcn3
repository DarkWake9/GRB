The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 02:25:56 UT on 15 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220315A (trigger 669003961.874798 / 220315101).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 236.1, Dec = -76.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 44m, -76d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 21.0 degrees.
