"WIDGET has continuously monitored the entire error region of the GRB
060211A (Hurkett et al. GCN 4736, 4740) with repeat of unfiltered
5-second exposures during the night of 11th February. The 1-sigma
limiting magnitude of images taken between 792 seconds before and 321
seconds after the burst was around V=10.8 magnitude. The magnitude was
derived by the Tycho-2 catalog. There was no significant emission from
the X-ray afterglow position up to the limiting magnitudes."
