A.J. Levan (U. Warwick) and N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report for a larger collaboration: 

“We observed the location of the short GRB 160408A (Evans et al. GCN 19260) with Gemini-North and GMOS. Observations were taken in the r-band, starting at 07:23 UT, approximately 58 minutes after the burst. Several objects are present in the field close to the refined XRT position (Osborne et al. GCN 19261). The closest objects are a compact source (A) and a more extended galaxy (B). The locations of these sources are: 

Source A: 
RA(J2000) 08h 10m 29.81s
DEC(J2000) 71d 07’ 43.7” 

Source B: 
RA(J2000) 08h 10m 29.32s
DEC(J2000) 71d 07’ 40.5”

with an uncertainty of approximately 0.3” in each co-ordinate. Conditions were not photometric at the time of the observations, but comparison with USNO-B1 sources in the field of view suggests that source A has a magnitude of r~24.5, source B is approximately a magnitude brighter. 

We thank the Gemini staff for the rapid execution of these observations.“
