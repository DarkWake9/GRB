Konus-Wind team report:

The long GRB 131215A (MAXI/GSC detection and localization:
K. Fukushima et al., GCN 15597) was detected by Konus-Wind
in the waiting mode at about T0(MAXI)= 32900 s UT (09:08:20).

The burst began with a pulse with a duration of about 60 s, followed by 
a less intense emission lasting ~240 s. The total burst duration was 
about 300 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of (1.4 +/- 0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Modelling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0(KW) to T0(KW)+300 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) yields
alpha = -1.28 (-0.27, +0.31), and
Ep = 263 (-87, +234) keV

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
