A. Nicuesa, S. Klose (both TLS Tautenburg), and J. Greiner (MPE Garching), 
report on behalf of the GROND team:

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), the 7-channel imager mounted 
at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope on La Silla, started follow-up observations 
of GRB 100615A (D'Elia et al. 2010, GCN 10841) on June 15 at 2:05 UT 
(about 6 min after the trigger).

Within the 3.7 arcsec XRT error circle we do not find any afterglow 
candidate. Preliminary measured upper limits based on an 8 min observing 
block starting at 2:20 UT are (in the AB system, 3 sigma):

g' > 24.2,
r' > 23.9,
i' > 22.9,
z' > 22.5,
J  > 21.4,
H  > 20.7,
K  > 20.3,

using GROND zeropoints and the 2MASS catalog. This is in agreement with 
the report by Dhillon et al. about the non-detection in the i' band (GCN 
10842).
