Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120714A (trigger #526593)
(Saxton, et al., GCN Circ. 13464).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 167.975, -30.625 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 11m 54.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 37' 29.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 40%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse starting at
~T-1 sec, peaking at ~T+4 sec, and ending at ~T90 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 16.2 +- 4.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.74 to T+17.78 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.62 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.2 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.58 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
