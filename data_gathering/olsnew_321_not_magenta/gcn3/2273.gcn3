TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2273
SUBJECT: GRB 030528: Optical Observations

FROM:    Nestor Mirabal at Columbia U.  <abulafia@astro.columbia.edu>

N. Mirabal & J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) report on
behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We obtained I-band images on the MDM 1.3m for 1.5 hours
on June 5.28, covering the positions of most of the Chandra
X-ray sources listed by Butler et al. (GCN 2269).

We detect optical counterparts of three of the four
sources within the revised SXC region reported by Villasenor
et al. (GCN 2261).  The source CXOU J170400.3-223710,
tentatively proposed as the GRB afterglow by Greiner et al.
(GCN 2271), is not detected in any of our images to a preliminary
limiting magnitude I > 21.5.  Comparison with prior observations
and deeper optical images of this location would be useful."
