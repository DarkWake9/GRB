We observed the field of GRB000210 (GCN # 539, 540) using 2.34m
Vainu Bappu Telescope (FOV =10') in R and V band filters on
10th and 11th Feb, 2000.
 
On Feb 10, between 14.35-15.18 UT we took 4 frames in R (each 300sec) and 
a V frame of 600sec. On Feb 11, between 13.66-15.275 UT we took one V (900s) 
and several R frames of short exposures. Observations were made at airmass >
2.2 and with high background from Moon.
 
At the limit of R=18.0 we donot detect any object at the position of
Chandra's x-ray source (GCN # 544, 548) in the combined frames.
