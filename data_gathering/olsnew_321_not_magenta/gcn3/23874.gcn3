We observed the optical afterglow of GRB190202A (Lien , et al., GCN  23830, Novichonok et al. GCN 23831, Kuin P, et al. GCN 23834, Cucchiara A, et al. GCN 23839) with the 0.7m robotic GROWTH-India telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory.Observation were started at 2019-02-02 19:25:26.704. We observed the field using r filter with 600sec exposure.. We clearly detected a faint afterglow source at coordinates specified in (Kuin P, et al. GCN 23834). Magnitudes were calibrated using PanSTARRs reference stars in the same field from the PS1 catalog. The measured magnitude in r filter image is 20.58 +/- 0.1 (AB magnitude)

GROWTH India telescope is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA).
