TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4645
SUBJECT: Possible GRB 060203: candidate optical counterpart

D. Malesani (SISSA) and S. Piranomonte (INAF/OAR) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

After the report of the position of the possible X-ray counterpart 
(Burrows, GCN 4644) of the Swift trigger 180151 (Retter et al., GCN 
4641), we inspected again our images taken at Asiago (Piranomonte et 
al., GCN 4643).

Inside the XRT error circle we find a single object at the coordinates 
(J2000):
  alpha = 06:54:03.85;
  delta = +71:48:38.4.
The error is estimated to be less than 0.5".

The magnitude of this object is R ~ 20.4 after assuming R=18.1 for the 
closeby USNO star U1575_02633321 located 15 arcsec N-W.

We have no possibility yet to assess variability. Further observations 
are in progress.
