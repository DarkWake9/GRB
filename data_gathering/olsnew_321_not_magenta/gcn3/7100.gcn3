P. Romano, C. Guidorzi (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB), A. Moretti (OAB)
and T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT Team:

Using prompt downlinked data (482.4 s), we find an X-ray
source located at RA, Dec 335.0437, -63.4424 which is
   RA(J2000)  = 22 20 10.49
   Dec(J2000) = -63 26 32.6
with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This is 37.2 arcseconds from the BAT position (Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 7098).
Further analysis will be reported in a subsequent circular.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
