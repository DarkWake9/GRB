collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 201014A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 28623)
using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell Discovery
Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ. Observations started on October 16,
07:08:10 UT (1.35 days after the Swift trigger) taking 4 exposures of
175 s each with SDSS i and SDSS r filters. Observations were taken
at an airmass of about 1.01 and seeing of about 1.7".
We detected the optical transient (Pozanenko et al., GCN 28628; de Ugarte
 Postigo et al, GCN 28650) inside the enhanced XRT position (D'Elia et al.
GCN 28626) measuring the following AB magnitudes: i=22.75 +- 0.07 and
r=24.30 +- 0.12.

Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and not corrected
for Galactic extinction.

The r/i drop-out is consistent with the high-z measured from GTC
(de Ugarte Postigo et al, GCN 28650).

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope and Quanzhi Ye for
assistance with these observations.
