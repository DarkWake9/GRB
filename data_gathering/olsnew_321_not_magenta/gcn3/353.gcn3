TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  353
SUBJECT: GRB 990506 - clarification to GCN 352

It has come to my attention that the phrasing of GCN 352 is
misleading. I would like to clarify that the discussed NOT 
data from 6.96 May and 7.91 May 1999 are consistent with the 
detection of a presumed host galaxy, done at Keck II (GCN 351).
