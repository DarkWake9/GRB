We observed the field of GRB 150811A (Evans, et al., GCN 18119) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/08 11.17 to 2015/08 11.19 UTC (2.6
minutes to 0.47 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36
hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We detect a highly-time-variable uncatalogued source within Swift-XRT error
circle.  In comparison with the USNO-B1 catalog, we obtain the following:

  r     17.51 +/- 0.01
  i     17.22 +/- 0.01
  z     16.76 +/- 0.04

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source is located at RA, Dec =
19:25:21.40, -15:25:30.2 (J2000, +/-0.5").

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.  Further observations are planned.
