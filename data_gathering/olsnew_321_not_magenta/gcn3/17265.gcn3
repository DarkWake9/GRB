O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:28:53.76 UT on the 1st of January 2015, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150101A
(trigger 441786536 / 150101270). The GBM on-ground location,
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with the
enhanced Swift XRT position (Goad et al. 2015, GCN 17262).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 12 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single quick pulse with
a duration (T90) of about 0.24 s (50-300 keV). The
time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.13 s to T0+13 s is
adequately fit by a power law function. The power law index is
 -1.5 +/- 0.1. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time
interval is (9.9 +/- 2.0)E-08  erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak
photon flux measured starting from T0-0.1 s in the
10-1000 keV band is 5.3 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
