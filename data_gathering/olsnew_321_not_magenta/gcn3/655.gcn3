"Beginning on April 29.07 UT we observed GRB000418 with the VLA at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. At the position of the IR/optical transient
reported by Klose et al. (GCN 645) and Mirabal et al. (GCN 650), we
detect a bright radio source with a flux density of 850+/-33 microJy.
We will continue to monitor this source."
