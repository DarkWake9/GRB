R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:48:40 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 110905A (trigger=502415).  Swift did not slew because
of the Moon observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 278.954, -19.318, which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 35m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = -19d 19' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve is not available at this time. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position,
before 12:33 UT on 2011 September 8. There will thus be no XRT or UVOT
data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. Pagani (cp232 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
