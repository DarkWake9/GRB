J. C. Tello, Y. Hu (IAA-CSIC), A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, ISA-UMA),
S. Oates (Warwick U.), A. Perez-Romero and D. Garcia-Alvarez (GTC-IAC)
on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

We observed the field of GRB 160601A (Kocevski et al., GCN 19478) with the
Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) with the OSIRIS instrument and acquired
6x100s images starting 01:37:31 UT and ending 01:49:29 UT on July 2nd
(10h54m-11h06m after the Swift trigger) and we detect the afterglow
candidates reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 19485).

We also find like Schulze (GCN 19488) that Object 1 is fading and at the
time of our observations was at a magntude of ~ 23.5 in the Sloan_r filter
and calibrated to SDSS Release 6.

We note that our observations precede Schulze's by 2.5 hours and are
slightly fainter but not much more than the uncertainty of these
preliminary results, implying either a rebrightening event or a plateau due
to either afterglow behaviour or host galaxy.
