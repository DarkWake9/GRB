report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of Fermi GRB 091003 (Rau GCN 9983; McEnery et al 
GCN 9985; Starling & Beardmore GCN 9986) with the William Herschel 
Telescope, using the ACAM instrument. We took a 60 and a 250 second 
exposure in imaging mode, starting at 21:11 UT, October 4 (1.69 days after 
burst).
The afterglow is clearly detected, with r = 21.33 +/- 0.11 (calibrated to 
SDSS field stars), at position:

RA (J2000) = 16:46:04.687
Dec (J2000) = +36:37:30.76
with uncertainty 0.3 arcseconds.

We obtained spectroscopy with ACAM immediately after, at high airmass. Two 
900 second exposures were obtained using the 400V grism and a 1 arcsecond 
slit. Faint continuum emission is detected over the 4000-9300 A range. No 
strong absorption or emission lines are detected. The detection of 
continuum at 4000A gives a upper limit to the redshift of 2.3.
