E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the error circle of GRB 030324 (GCN 1954) with the VLA on
2003, April 19.10 UT at 8.46 GHz.  With the exception of a source at
(J2000) RA=13:36:59.3, DEC=-00:17:25.1 which is visible in a FIRST survey
image (http://sundog.stsci.edu/top.html), there are no sources within the
error circle down to a 3-sigma limit of 0.18 mJy.  In particular, we do
not detect a radio source at the position of the putative optical
afterglow suggested by Lamb et al. (GCN 2139) down to the same limit."
