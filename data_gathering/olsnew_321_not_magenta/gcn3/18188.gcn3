S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report that trigger #652824 (UT=02:17:28) was due to noise in the image and
the lower trigger threshold level used for regions on the sky that correlate
with known sources or galaxies (M31 in this case).
This trigger is not anything astrophysical.
