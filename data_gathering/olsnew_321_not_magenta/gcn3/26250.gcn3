The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S191110af (GCN Circular 26222) is no longer considered to
be a candidate of interest. Further analysis by the cWB [1] pipeline
and investigations of the data quality at LIGO Hanford identified a
short period with an elevated rate of instrumental artifacts in the
frequency range of the trigger.
