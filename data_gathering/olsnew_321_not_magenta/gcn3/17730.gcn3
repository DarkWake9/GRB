WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150423A (Pagani et al.,
GCN 17728) starting at 06:30:00 UT, 116 s after the burst, under
thin-cloudy condition. Observations were performed with an
automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and
the exposure time was 20 s per image. We do not detect the optical
source reported by Varela et al. (GCN 17729), in our images, nor
any other new source within the XRT error circle. The typical
limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about 17.0
calibrated to USNO B1.0.
