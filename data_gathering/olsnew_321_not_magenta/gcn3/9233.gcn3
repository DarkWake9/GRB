There are 6 MASTER Very Wide Field cameras located at Kislovodsk and Irkutsk 
with common FOW = 6000 square degrees (http://observ.pereplet.ru/).

One of the two  MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Irkutsk
(D=50 mm, 2x1000 square degrees, 11 Mpx, 72" per pix in binning regime) 
has observed  UVOT error box (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9223) with 1s exposure 
befoure, during and after GRB Time without time gap between images.
The error box is near at the center of our FOW.

Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitude limit of the each emage is  ~8 m at the center of FOW (some 
cloudy on the sky). The limit of coadded five images ~ 9 m.

The reduction is continued.
