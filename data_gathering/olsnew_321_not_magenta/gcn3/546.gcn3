E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On February 10.98 UT we used the VLA to observe a field centered at
the position provided by the SAX WFC (GCN 539 and 540). There are no
radio sources brighter than 0.26 mJy (4-sigma) within the 2-arcminute
radius of the WFC error circle. A limit of 0.13 mJy can be placed on
the absence of a radio source within the 2-arcsecond radius error
circle (GCN 544) of the Chandra X-ray source. Further observations are
planned"
