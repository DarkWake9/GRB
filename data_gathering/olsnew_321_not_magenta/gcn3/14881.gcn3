J.C.Tello, V. Casanova (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (UPV-EHU, IAA-CSIC),
A.J.Castro-Tirado, R. Sanchez-Ramirez, M. Jelinek (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of
a larger collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB130612A (Racusin et al., GCNC 14874) in the
I-band with the 1.5m telescope in Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. Combining
33x10s images (for a total 330 seconds of exposure) spanning from 03h38m
(16 minutes after the burst) to 03h55m (with a mean time of 25 minutes
after the burst) we observe the reported afterglow (Melandri et al., GCNC
14875) with a magnitude of I(Vega) ~ 18.7 when compared to the USNO B1.0
catalog.
