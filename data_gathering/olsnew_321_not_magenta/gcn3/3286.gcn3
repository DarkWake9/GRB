" We have imaged the GRB 050416 optical afterglow position (Bradley et
al, GCN 3265) using 0.8-m telescope at XingLong Observatory, China.
The observations started at 18.65 UT (~ 7.57 hours after the
burst). Due to the bad weather condition (seeing ~ 4"), the limiting
magnitude of our R band co-added image is ~ 18.6 compared with
USNOB1.0 stars. No new source was detected under the limiting
magnitude.
