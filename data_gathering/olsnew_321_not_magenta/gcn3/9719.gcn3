R.J. Smith, C.G. Mundell (Liverpool JMU) on behalf of a large 
collaboration report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically reacted to GRB 090727 (SWIFT 
trigger 358520, Evans et al, GCN Circ. 9718), starting observing at 
22:44:59UTC. A source which is not visible in the digitized sky survey is 
detected in both SDSS r' and i' filters at position 21:03:50.6 +64:55:30 
J2000. This lies within the XRT error circle reported by Evans et al, GCN 
Circ. 9718. The approximate magnitude, calibrated with respect to nearby 
USNOB stars is R=21.3 +/- 0.2 and I = 20.2 +/- 0.2. The target is slightly 
crowded by brighter stellar sources and analysis is ongoing to determine 
if the OT candidate is fading.
