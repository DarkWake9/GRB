SUBJECT: IPN detection of continued SGR1900+14 activity

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind 
and Helicon-Coronas GRB teams, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Between November 24 and November 30 2002, eleven intense SGR-like
bursts have been observed, not all of which can be localized
at present for technical reasons.  Of those bursts that can
be localized, the triangulation annuli are consistent with
the position of SGR1900+14.  The number of intense bursts per day
observed over this seven-day period was 3, 0, 1, 4, 2, 0, and 1.
Therefore we believe that this source continues to be active,
possibly with a decreasing level of activity.
