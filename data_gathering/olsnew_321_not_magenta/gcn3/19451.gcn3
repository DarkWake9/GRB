The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160314A (D'Elia et al., GCN 19182) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 14.65, Mar 15.81, Mar 
17.73, Mar 21.82, and Mar 24.91 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Osborne et al., GCN 19185), with 3sigma upper limits 
of 280 uJy, 100 uJy, 270 uJy, 100 uJy, and 320 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
