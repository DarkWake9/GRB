The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:44:29 UT on 11 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191111A (trigger 595154674.947684 / 191111364).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 189.3, Dec = -32.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 37m, -32d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
