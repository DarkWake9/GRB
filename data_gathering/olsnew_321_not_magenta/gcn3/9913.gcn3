At 07:00:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090916 (trigger=362818).  Swift did not slew to the GRB
due to a Moon constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 126.579, +25.933 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 26m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 55' 60"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single
short spike structure with a duration of about ~0.4 sec, followed
by ~8 seconds of low-energy emission.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot immediately slew to
the BAT position.  There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this 
trigger until later today. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (eleonora.troja AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
