Swift team.

We have analysed the first 2.3 ks of the XRT observation 
of GRB070805 (Parsons et al., GCN 6708).
Due to Earth limb constraint the XRT began observing the 
GRB location 33 min after the trigger, at 20:28:48 UT.
No sources are visible in this first orbit of data, with 
an upper limit to the unabsorbed flux of 2.4e-13 
erg/s/cm2.
We are waiting for more data for further analysis.
