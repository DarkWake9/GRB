SUBJECT: GRB030329, further radio observations at GMRT

A. Pramesh Rao and C. H. Ishwara Chandra (NCRA, Pune),
D. Bhattacharya (RRI, Bangalore) and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA, Granada)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The afterglow of GRB030329 (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985) was observed
with the GMRT for about 5 hours on May 31, 2003. The observations were at
1288  MHz with a bandwidth of 12MHz and effective angular resolution of
~3.5". The flux density of the source seen at the position of the GRB on
31 March and 01 April 2003 (Rao et al, GCN 2073) has increased to 1.1 mJy
confirming that the radio source is related to the GRB.

The details of the GMRT measurements of GRB030329 at 1288 MHz:

Date                        Time               Flux Density

31 May 2003                14-18 UT         1100+/-150 microJy
31 March/01 April 2003     14-22 UT          330+/-100 microJy

The quoted error bars are 2-sigma, and include systematic errors of
calibration.

Note that the flux density at 31 March/01 April epoch has been
revised upwards in comparison to that reported in GCN 2073,
following a better absolute flux density calibration.
