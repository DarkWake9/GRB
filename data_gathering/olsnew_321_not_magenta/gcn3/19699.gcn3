report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 160714A (Siegel et al. GCN 
19697) with the 1.5m OSN telescope, in Granada (Spain). 
Observations started at 2:33 UT (14 min after the GRB onset) and 
consisted of 3x180s + 4x300s I-band images. Each of the 
individual images cover the complete BAT error circle. In a 
preliminary analysis we detect no new source within the BAT error 
box down to a 3-sigma limit of I(AB) > 20.5 mag in the first image, 
and down to I(AB) > 21.5 mag in the combined image (mean time 
2:48 UT, 29 minutes after the burst), as compared to SDSS data.
