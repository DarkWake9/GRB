TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2012
SUBJECT: GRB 030329: still bright

P. Martini (OCIW), P. Berlind, K. Z. Stanek (CfA) and P. Garnavich
(Notre Dame):

We imaged the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price: GCN
1985; Torii: GCN 1986) with the Magellan 6.5-m Clay telescope and
LDSS2 imaging/spectrograph on March 30 UT 01:15 (13.6 hours after the
burst). We also obtained imaging data with the FLWO 1.2-m telescope.
The R-band magnitude is estimated to be 15.1 assuming star "A" is
R=16.2 (see

http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~kstanek/grb030329.ps).

Thus the OT continues to be very bright. We should note that the
several fairly bright objects closest to the OT are clearly resolved
in our images and should not be used for relative photometry.  "A" and
"B" appear to be stellar at ~1.3'' seeing.

The foreground reddening from Schlegel et al. (1998) is E(B-V)=0.025.
