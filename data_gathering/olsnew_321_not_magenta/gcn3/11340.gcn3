We report on the observation of the Swift GRB 100906A (Markwardt et al.,
GCN 11227) with the 0.5m telescope D50 in Ondrejov (Czech Republic),
starting at 21:17:37 UT, i.e. ~7.5h after the trigger. Eventually, six
hours of observational data were obtained, with the last image taken at
3:23:20 UT.

We clearly detect the afterglow reported by Ivanov et al. (GCN 11228),
and at the the beginning of our sequence (coadded first 7x 20s, exp.
mean time = 21:19 UT) we measure a magnitude 18.7 +- 0.2.
