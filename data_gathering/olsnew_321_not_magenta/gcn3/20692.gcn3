GBM was observing 41% of the LIGO cWB probability map for G274296 at event
time, with much of the northern arc occulted by Earth. There is no GBM
on-board trigger within 12 hours of event time. The untargeted ground-based
search of GBM data for short-duration GRBs (Briggs et al., in prep) found
no candidates close in time to G274296.
The targeted search of the GBM data ([1], [2]) also did not find a
significant gamma-ray signal. This search processes time scales of 0.265 to
8.192 s within 30 s of the LIGO event. No interesting gamma-ray candidate
was found within this time window.

Further analysis and upper limits will be reported later.
