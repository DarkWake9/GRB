W. Li, N. Butler, J. S. Bloom, and A. V. Filippenko, University of
California, Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB team, report:

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 060923, detected with Swift
(Trigger 230662; Stamatikos et al. GCN 5583). The automatic sequence
started at 05:12:33, 18 s after the burst. The first two images,
however, failed due to some technical issues. In subsequent images,
Our image processing pipeline did not find any new objects, and
reported the following photometry limits (calibrated with USNO B1.0):
