We observed the field of GRB 171123A (Evans et al., GCN 22148) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories. Observations began from 21:02:44 UT, about 6.8 hours after the trigger. We did not detect any source within the X-ray afterglow position error circle (Goad et al. GCN 22150), down to a limit of R~21.6 mag.
