We performed optical spectroscopy of the optical transient MASTER
OT J105519.53+365834.1PSN in PGC 032819 (Lipunov et al. GCN 20712)
with 1.5-m Kanata telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory on
2017 Feb 21. The spectrum shows a broad absorption line around
620 nm. The overall features suggest that this PSN is a SN 1991T
like bright Type Ia supernova around maximum brightness. A
comparison with a library of supernova spectra using GELATO
(Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A.Ap. 488, 383) suggests that the
spectrum gives a good match to SN 1998es at -3.5 days before
B-band maximum.
