R. Chornock, E. Berger (Harvard), and D. Fox (Penn St.) report:

We obtained spectroscopy of the optical afterglow of GRB 111107A (Siegel 
et al., GCN 12534; LaCluyze et al., GCN 12535; Kruehler et al., GCN 
12536) using GMOS-South on the Gemini-South 8-m telescope.  Observations 
began at 05:05 UT (4.2 hrs after the BAT trigger).  Inspection of the 
first two exposures (range 4160-8140 Angstroms) reveals a damped 
Lyman-alpha absorber as well as narrow absorption lines of C IV, Al II, 
and C II at a common redshift of 2.893.
