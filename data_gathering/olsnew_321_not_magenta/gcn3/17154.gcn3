MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB141208.63 17 sec after notice 
time and 44 sec after trigger time at 2014-12-08 15:10:43 UT. On our 
second (20s exposure)  set we  found  optical transient within FERMI 
error-box (ra=04 55 55 dec=+69 24 00 r=16.733300) .

MASTER OT J001907.27+403423.8 - new possible CV ( V. Vladimirov et 
al., Atel 6792).

MASTER-Kislovodsk auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) 
= 00h 19m 07.27s +40d 34m 23.8s on 2014-12-08.63441 UT.

  The OT position is within 1" of the star APM EO1243-0352761 (bmag=22.06). 
Color-combined DSS finder chart is uploaded to 
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/J001907+403423-BRIR5x5.jpg (2x zoom). 
There is a possible UV counterpart GALEX J001907.4+403424 
(NUV=22.51+/-0.41). Nothing is present at this position in 1RXS, 2MASS, 
GCVS and AAVSO VSX. This area of sky in Andromeda is not covered by SDSS. 
Catalina Sky Survey has two past detections in Orphan Catalogue to 16.9m 
on 2012 Nov. 15 and 18.4m on 2013 Sep. 16. NEAT project has 10 images on 3 
different nights from 1998 Aug. 18 to 2002 Oct. 13 with no additional 
outbursts.

Based on the amplitude of variability and previous outbursts, MASTER OT 
J001907.27+403423.8 is a new cataclysmic variable (dwarf nova) in Our 
Galaxy. The offset from M31 galaxy center (4.48 degree West, 0.70 degree 
South) is too large for it to be related to M31. The location in Fermi GRB 
error box is likely a chance coincidence. The object brightness has not 
changed significantly on the images obtained 4.5-5 hours after the 
discovery, on Dec. 08.818-08.841 UT (unfiltered magnitude 17.6-17.7). 
Follow up observations are encouraged. The discovery and reference images 
are available at: http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/001907.27403423.8.png
