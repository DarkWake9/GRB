report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:57:41.18 UT on 16 July 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered
and located GRB 200716C (trigger 616633066 / 200716957) which was also
detected by the Swift (Ukwatta et al.,  GCN 28124), Fermi-LAT (Ohno et al.,
GCN 28130). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with both the Swift
and Fermi-LAT positions.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 37
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two overlapping pulses with a duration (T90) of
about 5.3 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.26 s to
T0+4.9 s is best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy
cutoff.  The power law index is -1.07 +/- 0.03 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 716 +/- 97 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (9.57 +/- 0.25)E-6
erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0 + 64 ms in
the 10-1000 keV band is 19.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
