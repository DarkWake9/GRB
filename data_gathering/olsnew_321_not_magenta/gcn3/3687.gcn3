Reichart report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically began observing the
localization of GRB 050726 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 3682) 18.5 hours after
the burst in Rc.  A quick look reveals no new sources within or around the
XRT localization down to the limit of the DSS2-Red.  Observations are
ongoing.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
