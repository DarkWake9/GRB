ENGRAVE targeted 9 fields containing 17 high-probability host galaxies
for S190814bv, based on the LALInference skymap (LIGO Scientific
Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 25333), with deep
VLT/HAWK-I imaging over two epochs in a search for intrinsically
faint, near-infrared transient sources. As part of this search, we
observed the field of two candidates, AT 2019onj and AT 2019okr,
reported by Soares-Santos et al. (GCN 25486).

The observations were conducted between 06:55 and 07:14 UT on
2019-08-16 and a second epoch between 04:32 and 04:50 UT on
2019-08-21, approximately 1.4 and 6.3 d after S190814bv, respectively
(600 s exposure per epoch in the Ks filter). The sources are detected
in both epochs with magnitudes:

Name           dT       Ks mag
AT 2019onj   1.4 d   19.20 +- 0.03
AT 2019onj   6.3 d   19.15 +- 0.02
AT 2019okr   1.4 d   19.55 +- 0.03
AT 2019okr   6.3 d   19.54 +- 0.03

The magnitudes (in the Vega system, not corrected for extinction) are
based on preliminary photometry calibrated against a single 2MASS
star, and the absolute calibration has an extra error by 0.05 mag.

No significant variability can be measured between our HAWK-I observations.

This field was also covered serendipitously by the ESO/VISTA survey
telescope in the Ks band during its science verification program. Both
objects are detected in images from 2009-10-23 and 2009-10-30, and
both are fainter than in the HAWK-I images (by 0.68+-0.18 and 0.83 +-
0.26 mag for AT 2019onj and AT 2019okr, respectively). The large
uncertainty is entirely due to the low S/N of the archival VISTA data.

The lack of variability between the VLT/HAWK-I epochs and especially
the archival detections suggest that AT2019onj and AT2019okr are
unrelated to S190814bv.
