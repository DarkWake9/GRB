Martinez-Sansigre (MPI Heidelberg), J. Graham, A. Fruchter (STScI) 
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of GRB 070714B (Racusin et al. GCNC 6620) with the William 
Herschel Telescope (WHT), obtaining at total of 2700s of observations in the 
R-band, beginning on July 15 04:17 UT. At the position of the afterglow 
candidate of Melandri (GCNC 6621), we detect an object with a magnitude of 
R~23.5 (relative to two USNO stars within the field). The observed fading 
confirms the association with GRB 070714B. Further observations will be 
necessary to determine if the current magnitude is significantly contaminated 
by an underlying host galaxy.
