on behalf of Lulin GRB collaboration report:

 We have observed the optical candidate of GRB040924 reported by Fox
et al. (GCN 2734) with 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory ( National
Central University, Taiwan). We made B, V, R and I-band imaging
observations starting at 14.31 UT (2.3 hrs after the burst). =20
 Based on our preliminary analysis, the optical candidate was
detected. The position of the candidate referenced to the USNO-B1.0
are=20

 RA =3D 02:06:22.52, Dec =3D 16:06:48.5 (J2000)

 with uncertainties of approximately 0.2".=20

The R-band magnitude at 18.67 UT (6.7 hrs after the burst) is 21.4
mag. compared with near USNO-B1.0 stars as photometric references.

 Further analysis are in progress."
