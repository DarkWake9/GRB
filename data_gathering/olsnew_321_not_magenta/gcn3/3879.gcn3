The Swift-BAT triggered (trigger=152038) at 17:43:37 UT on 25 August 2005.
Using only the TDRSS data products (rough lightcurve and image detection
significance), we can not say if this is real or not;  although the tentative
idenitification is not a real GRB (2-to-1 confidence level).
We will know more in about an hour when the full data set is downlinked.
