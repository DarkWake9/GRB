TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13832
SUBJECT: Swift Trigger 535026: ROTSE-III Optical Limits

W. Zheng (U Mich), T. Guver (Sabanci U), report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:


ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe,
Turkey, responded to Swift trigger 535026 (D'Elia et al., GCN 13831),
producing images beginning 8.0 s after the GCN notice time. An automated
response took the first image at 18:24:26.0 UT, 83.7 s after the burst,
under fair conditions. These observations were affected by proximity to
the full moon. We took 10 5-sec, and 20 20-sec exposures. These
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging is
on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle. Individual
images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 14.4-15.4; we set the
following specific limits.
