On 2009 Jan 22, the SPI Anti-Coincidence System (ACS) on-board INTEGRAL 
recorded two bright and long bursts from the AXP 1E1547.0-5408 that 
recently reactivated (GCN 8833, 8835, 8837, 8838).

In both bursts, pulsations at the neutron star period of 2.1 s are clearly visible

The start times, duration, and ACS peak count rates (Dt=50 ms) are the 
following:
   
1) 06:48:04.2 UT     8.4 s    1.5 10^6 cts/s 
2) 08:17:29.4 UT     6.4 s    1.9 10^5 cts/s

Burst 1) consists of a short inital spike, lasting about 0.25 s, followed
by a pulsating tail.
