The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 09:07:37 UT on 14 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200514B (trigger 611140062.123856 / 200514380).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 238.3, Dec = 37.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 53m, 37d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 63.0 degrees.
