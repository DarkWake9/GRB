With KMTNet, we observed the whole 60\% credible region of the updated
localization map of the BNS merger candidate, S190510g (LIGO/Virgo GCN
24448). The observation took place at the KMTNet South Africa (SAAO) and
Chile (CTIO) stations, starting at 2019-5-10 16:38 UT. The images were
taken in R-band with 240 sec exposure time to the depth of R ~ 21.7
(5-sigma detection). The search for transients is ongoing, although no
obvious transient has been identified so far.


We thank the KMTNet staffs for performing the observation.
