of  larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 130822A (Kocevski et al., GCN 15112) 
on Aug., 22 with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory, 
SANTEL-400AN (0.4m) telescope of ISON-Kislovodsk observatory, and AZT-8 
(0.7m) telescope of Institute of Astronomy, Kharkiv National University. 
We obtained several unfiltered frames with exposures of 120 s (AS-32), 
100 s and 60 s (SANTEL-400AN), and several frames with filter R with 
exposure of 120 s (AZT-8).  Within the enhanced XRT circle (Beardmore et 
al., GCN 15117) we did not detect any source on stacked images.

The details of the photometry are the following:

The photometry is based on SDSS stars, R mag (R mag obtained via
transformations ugriz in BVRI (Lupton, 2005):
