H. Kumar (IITB), P. Dorje (IIA), V. Bhalerao(IITB), G. C. Anupama(IIA), S.
Barway(IIA), report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:


We observed GRB200906A reported by Swift-BAT (K. L. Page et al., (GCN
28371), see also S.Y. Fu et al.,(GCN 28372), A.P. Beardmore

Et al., (GCN 28373), R. Hamburg et al., (GCN 28374) & D. A. Kann et al.,
(GCN 28376) with 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. The field was observed in the
SDSS r filter starting at 2020-09-06T16:34:48 UT i.e. ~ 3.33 hrs after the
event detection by Swift-BAT. We didnâ€™t find any new source within an
uncertainty region of 1.9 arcsec around Ra(J2000) = 18:09:06.08, Dec(J2000)
= +67:52:48.1 (GCN 28373) with an upper limit of*: *

r  > 20.14 mag

(calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data release, Flewelling et al., 2018)



The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government

of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
