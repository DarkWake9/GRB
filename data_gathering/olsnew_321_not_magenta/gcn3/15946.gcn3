MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru)
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB140311A  27 sec after trigger time
and  127 sec after trigger
time at 2014-03-11 21:07:23 UT in two polarizations. On our first (30s
exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box
(Racusin et. al GCN 15944).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.27mag


MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB140311A 10 sec after
notice time and 89 sec after trigger time at 2014-03-11 21:06:45 UT in 
two polarizations.
On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within
SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14mag. The observations made on the
morning sky.
