We observed LIGO/Virgo S200114f (Chatterjee et al, GCN Circ. 26734) with
the DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) on the night of
2020-01-14 UTC.

We tiled the LVC localization with four pointings spanning a region of
approximately 13.6 degrees in RA and 20.4 degrees in DEC centered on the
peak of the probability map at 07:20:09 +15:42:50 2000. This region covers
about 280 square degrees and includes about 80% of the probability in the
map. We observed from 2020-01-14 02:40 UTC to 2020-01-14 12:00 UTC (from 29
minutes to 9.7 hours after the event) obtaining exposures of 53 to 65
minutes across the field in the w filter.

We calibrate our images against the APASS catalog. Our 10-sigma limiting
magnitude are typically between w = 18.9 and w = 19.5.

We detect no uncatalogued sources within the observed field with
significant fading or brightening.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro
Martir.
