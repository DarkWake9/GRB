C. Guidorzi, R. Martone (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C.G. Mundell 
(U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU) on behalf of a 
large collaboration report:

The LCO 1-m unit at McDonald Observatory (Texas) began observing Swift 
possibly short GRB 180402A (Lien et al. GCN 22580) on April 2, 10:02 UT 
(17.3 minutes since the GRB) with the SDSS-I filter. Within the XRT 
error circle we do not detect any uncatalogued optical afterglow down to 
i'>19.3 mag (5x120 s exposure, at a mid time of 23.7 min post GRB) as 
calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects.
