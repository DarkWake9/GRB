We report further analysis of GRB 140529A (Cummings, GCN Circ. #16340). The
best BAT position is RA, Dec 228.810,-41.042 which is

RA (J2000)    15h 15m 14.4s
Dec (J2000)  -41d 02' 33"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 1.2 arcmin.  This is 16 arcsec
from the previously reported BAT position and 85 arcsec from the position of
the XRT source reported in Evans et al. (GCN Circ #16342).  The partial coding
was about 18%.

The maskweighted lightcurve shows a single FRED peak with an estimated T90
of 4.5 +- 0.5 seconds.

The best fit to the spectrum from 15-150 keV is a powerlaw with an exponential
cutoff.  The photon index is 0.85 +- 0.35 with a cutoff energy of 75 +- 10 keV.
The best simple powerlaw fit has a photon index of 1.66 +- 0.08.  The total
fluence from 15-150 keV in5.0 seconds was (2.2 +- 0.1) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2.  The
1-second peak flux in the energy range 15-150 keV was 11.5 +- 0.7 photons/cm^2.

Because this was not a normal onboard trigger, the usual automated BAT data
products are not available.
