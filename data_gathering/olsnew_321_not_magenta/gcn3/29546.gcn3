Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia, M. A. Castro Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift trigger of GRB 210222B (Gropp et al. GCNC 29545), the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, automatically responded to this burst. Images were taken starting at 22:40:53 UT (~3.5 min after trigger). In the first 10s image, the afterglow reported by UVOT (Gropp et al. GCNC 29545) is detected with magnitude of 15.6 +/- 0.15 (clear filter). Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA for their excellent support.
