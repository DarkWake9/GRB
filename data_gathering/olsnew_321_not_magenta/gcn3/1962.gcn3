I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND+GRS), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and Konus-Wind
observed this GRB at 51310 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately  2 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately 1.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
1.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two preliminary, 3 sigma error boxes whose
approximate areas are 220 sq. arcmin. each and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  4 h 43 m  6.76 s    -19 o  6 '   8.18 "  (CENTER)
  4 h 42 m 40.72 s    -18 o 56 '  52.00 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 46 m 17.63 s    -19 o 57 '  38.06 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 39 m 37.19 s    -18 o  9 '   1.66 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 43 m 32.36 s    -19 o 15 '  16.64 "  (CORNER)

              OR  

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  3 h 40 m 50.29 s     -1 o 21 '  44.35 "  (CENTER)
  3 h 41 m 23.69 s     -1 o 29 '   5.72 "  (CORNER)
  3 h 37 m 50.12 s      0 o 30 '  18.01 "  (CORNER)
  3 h 44 m  9.29 s     -2 o 18 '  46.98 "  (CORNER)
  3 h 40 m 17.33 s     -1 o 14 '  30.76 "  (CORNER)

These error boxes may be improved, and it should be possible
to remove the ambiguity.
