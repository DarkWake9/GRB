TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  583
SUBJECT: GRB 000301C, UBVRI field photometry

FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired preliminary UBVRcIc all-sky photometry for
the field of GRB000301C with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one
photometric night.  This 11x11arcmin field covers the IPN
error box, contains the proposed optical counterpart, and extends
fainter than R=20.  The file includes the Garnavich, et. al.
(GCN 573) R-band comparison stars with similar magnitudes
within errors.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000301c.dat
This file will be updated as soon as the weather improves.
The current photometry has a potential external zero-point
error of about two percent.  Negative errors are Poisson only;
positive errors are standard deviation of two or more measures.

The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate
solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors
are less than 100mas.
