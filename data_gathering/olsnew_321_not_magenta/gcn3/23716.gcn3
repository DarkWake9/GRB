report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-01-14T20:57:02.63 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190114C (trigger ID: HEB190114872) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Swift/BAT (Gropp et al., GCN23688), 
MAGIC (Mirzoyan et al., GCN23701), Fermi/GBM (Hamburg et al., GCN23707), 
AGILE/MCAL (Ursi et al., GCN23712), INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (Minaev et al., 
GCN23714) and Fermi/LAT (Kocevski et al., GCN23709).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 15.68 s measured from T0+0.12 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0-0.01 s, is 10860.9 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 61531.1 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
GRB mode with the energy range of about 200-3000 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
