of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 130325A (Fermi-GBM detection: Tierney, GCN 14329;
Fermi-LAT detection: Vianello et al., GCN 14332)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=17516.880s UT (04:51:56.880)

The light curve shows a single pulse with a total duration of ~8 s.
The emission is seen up to 6 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB130325_T17516/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (8.1 ± 1.4)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.704s,
of (3.7 ± 0.4)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.90 ± 0.18,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.4 ± 0.3,
the peak energy Ep = 186 ± 28 keV,
chi2 = 59.8/78 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
