P. D'Avanzo, M. G. Bernardini, A. Melandri, T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB), P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of GRB 210826A (Ohno et al. GCN Circ. 30721), collecting a total of 14.6 ks 
of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+36.5 ks ks and T0+1.26e6 s. 

Of the 8 X-ray uncatalogued sources detected in the first observing epoch (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 30725), Source 1 and Source 5 are 
still detected with a consistent count-rate. The other sources are not detected down to a typical 3sigma upper limit of ~ 3e-3 ct/s. 
Therefore, we found no clear evidence for an X-ray afterglow candidate of GRB 210826A. 

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations, including a position-specific upper limit calculator, 
are available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00101.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
