report:

We have performed a spectral analysis of the WXM and FREGATE spectral
data for GRB 051022.  Fitting a power-law times exponential (PLE) model
jointly to the WXM and FREGATE spectral data yields a chi^2 of 185 for
139 DOF, while fitting a PLE model with absorption yields a chi^2 of
131 for 138 DOF.  Fitting a Band model jointly to the WXM and FREGATE
spectral data also yields a chi^2 of 131 for 138 DOF.  These results
show that the data strongly favor a PLE model with absorption over a
PLE model alone, and that a PLE model with absorption gives a 
satisfactory fit to the data.  They also show that the data do not 
request a Band model with absorption.

The best-fit spectral parameters for the PLE model with absorption are
alpha = -1.22+/-0.02, E_peak = 306 + 31/-26 keV, and n_H = 1.7 ± 0.4
x 10^22 atoms cm^-2.  The fluence is (2.2 ± 0.02) x 10^-5 erg cm^-2 
in the 2-30 keV energy band and (1.4 ± 0.02) x 10^-4 erg cm^-2 in the
30-400 keV energy band.  The ratio log(S_x/S_g) = -1.8, so GRB 051022 
is a "classical" hard GRB.
