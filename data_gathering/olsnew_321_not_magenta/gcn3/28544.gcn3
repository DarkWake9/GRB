We have analysed 6.2 ks of XRT data for GRB 201001A (Simpson et al. GCN
Circ. 28539), from 129 s to 24.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 28540). The source
is fading with alpha >0.5.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00998344.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
