"On June 17.88 - 17.92 UT we have imaged the field of GRB000616 (K.Hurley 
et al. GCN n.711)  with the 152 cm telescope of Loiano, R color. Because of 
the sky conditions and the full moon we were not able to detect any object 
fainter than 18th mag. Within this limit a preliminary quick inspection of  
the field does not show any new object with respect to the POSS.
