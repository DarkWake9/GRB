S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-
Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050502a (GCN 3323) with the automated
Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  Observations consisted of 30 x 120 s
exposures in the Kron R band.  We detect no emission at the position of
the afterglow reported by Yost et. al. (GCN 3322).  Our 3-sigma limiting
magnitude, estimated by comparison with several Guide Star Catalog
sources in the field, is approximately R > 21.5.
