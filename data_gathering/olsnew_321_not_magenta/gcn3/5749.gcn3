GRB 061021, Swift-BAT Lag analysis
 
J. Norris (Stanford/SLAC) and S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC)
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:
 
We have performed the lag analysis (Norris & Bonnell, ApJ, 2006)
on GRB 061021 (trigger 234905) (Moretti et al, GCN Circ 5743 &
Palmer et al, GCN Circ 5744) with the following results:
  72 ms +28-48 ms  between the  50-100 and 15-25 keV bands
  98 ms +30-32 ms  between the 100-350 and 25-50 keV bands
 128 ms +49-35 ms  between the 100-350 and 15-25 keV bands
(all with 16-ms binning).

We conclude that this is a Long Burst (and not a Short Burst
with Extended Emission).
