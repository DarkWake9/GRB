K. Wiersema (Leicester), N. Tanvir (Leicester), A. Levan (Warwick), 
R. Karjalainen (ING) report:

We observed the afterglow candidate of GRB 140508A (Singer et al. GCN 16226)
with the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope using the ACAM instrument.
We acquired 3x600s spectroscopic exposures, with midpoint 23:02 UT on 8 May 2014.
We find absorption lines of Mg II and Fe II at a common redshift of z=1.027, though we
caution this redshift is based on archival wavelength calibrations. This is consistent with 
the redshift reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 16229).
