S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift Team:

We conclude that Swift trigger #648422 (Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 17998) was
the result of noise fluctuations and is not due to a GRB or other astrophysical
event.

We have analyzed the BAT data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent
telemetry downlinks.  We find that there is no sign of significant emission from
the trigger location at any point in this interval.
