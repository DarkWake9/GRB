We report the search results in the BAT data within T0 ± 100 s of the
LIGO event G274296 (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration GCN Circ. 20689),
where T0 is the LIGO trigger time (2017-02-17T06:05:55.050 UTC).

The BAT pointing position at T0 is
RA = 133.700 deg,
DEC =  20.061 deg,
ROLL = 319.960 deg.
The BAT Field of View (>0.1 partial coding) covers 65.49% of the integrated
LIGO localization probability.

The closest event data covers the time range from T0-26.67 to T0-23.61,
and from T0+48.33 to T0+134.46. No sources with signal-to-noise ratio > 6 sigma
are found in these event data.

Also, no significant detections (signal-to-noise ratio > 4 sigma) are found
in the BAT raw light curves with time bins of 64 ms, 1 s, and 1.6 s, respectively.
Assuming an on-axis (100% coded) short GRB with a typical spectrum in the BAT
energy range (i.e., a simple power-law model with a power-law index of -1.32;
Lien & Sakamoto et al. 2016), the 4-sigma upper limit in the 1-s binned light
curve corresponds to a flux upper limit (15-350 keV) of ~ 6.9 x 10^-8 erg/s/cm^2.

BAT retains decreased, but significant, sensitivity to rate increases for
gamma-ray events outside of its FOV. About 17.86% of the integrated LIGO
localization probability was outside of the BAT FOV but above the Earth's limb
from Swift's location, and the corresponding flux upper limits for this region
are within roughly an order of magnitude of those within the FOV.
