Using the data set from T-239 to T+824 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060323 (trigger #202505)  (Vetere,
et al., GCN 4904).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec =
174.412,+50.003 deg {11h 37m 38.9s, 50d 0' 9.2"} (J2000) +- 1.3 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 80%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows multiple overlapping peaks
starting at T-5 sec and ending about T+25 sec.  Because the s/c
executed a pre-planned slew spanning T+85 to T+215 sec, we do not have
lightcurve data covering this interval.  There is no apparent
emission between T+220 and T+824 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 18 +- 2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.1 to T+14.7 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.53 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
5.7 +- 0.6 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+2.59 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
