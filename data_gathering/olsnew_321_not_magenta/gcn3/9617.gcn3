V. D'Elia, M. Perri (ASDC), T.N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

We analyzed the first 2.9 ks of the XRT data for the possible GRB 090705
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 9615). Data are in Photon Counting (PC) mode
and start ~6 minutes after the BAT trigger.
No source is detected within or near to the BAT error circle. The 3-sigma
upper limit on the count rate is 0.005 count s-1, corresponding to an
approximate observed 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.5x10-13 erg cm-2 s-1 (using a
standard counts to flux conversion factor).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
