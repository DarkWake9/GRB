E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix)
and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 23:46:40  UT of September 19, 2019.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  311.8862 deg
DEC.=  -44.7029 deg
with an uncertainty of   1.5  arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.6  ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about  3e-7 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
