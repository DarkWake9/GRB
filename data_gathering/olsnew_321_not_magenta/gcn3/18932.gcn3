Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Anlaug Amanda Djupvik (NOT), Tom Reynolds 
(NOT and Tuorla Obs.), and Pall Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160123A (Malesani et al., GCN 18926) with 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the NOTCam 
near-infrared camera. Observations were carried out in the J filter. Sky 
conditions were not optimal, with moonlit clouds and a seeing of 1.7". 
Three sets of nine images by 1 minute each were acquired, starting on 
Jan 24.067 UT (16.6 hr after the GRB).

After stacking the best 18 images, no source is detected within the XRT 
localization area (Beardmore et al., GCN 18927; see also 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/00671447/), down to a limiting 
magnitude J > 19.5 (Vega), calibrated against the 2MASS catalog.
