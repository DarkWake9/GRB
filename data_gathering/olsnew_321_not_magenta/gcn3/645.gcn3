report:


The central part of the error box of GRB 000418 (Hurley et al., GCN
#642) was imaged with the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope on April 20,
20:55 UT - 21:54 UT, using the near-infrared camera Omega Cass. The
limiting magnitude of the K'-band image is about K'=17 after adding
all images taken at different position angles of a wire-grid
polarizer. A second observing run was performed on  April 22, 02:22 UT
- 03:23 UT, using the same telescope and the same instrumentation.

The same region of the error box was also covered by K'-band (April
20, 22:06 UT - 22:46 UT and April 24, 21:36 UT - 22:30 UT) and
J-band images (April 21, 22:23 UT - 22:48 UT) taken with the Calar
Alto 1.23-m telescope using the near-infrared camera MAGIC.
Additional frames covering the whole error box (Hurley et al. GCN
#642) are being processed and the results will be reported soon.

A comparison between the April 20 and April 22 images and a
cross-check with the 1.23-m images has revealed a potentially fading
source within the central GRB error box at RA, DEC (J2000) =
12:25:19.3, 20:06:12 (+/- 1 arcsec). This source (K' ~ 16) is visible
on the 3.5-m and 1.23-m frames obtained during the first night. It has
no counterpart on the corresponding DSS2-red image. Since standard
stars are not available at the moment we can only  provide a rough
estimate of the brightness of the source. Further data reduction 
is in progress.

The K'-band image from April 22 will be posted on the Tautenburg Web page at
http://www.tls-tautenburg.de/research/grb000418.html.
