J. A. Kennea (PSU), K. Page and C. Hurkett (U. Leicester) report on behalf 
of the Swift/XRT Team:

We have performed a preliminary analysis of Swift/XRT ground-linked data 
for GRB060211B (Mateos et al., GCN 4739). We find a uncatalogued, fading 
source at the following location:

RA(J2000):   05:00:17.2
Dec(J2000): +14:56:57.1

with an estimated uncertainty of 6 arcseconds (90% containment). This 
position lies 33 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 4739. A 
full analysis of the XRT data will follow.
