M. M. Chester (Penn State), K. L. Page (U Leicester), and A. Amaral-Rogers 
(U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 1811 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers
none of the XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is
typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.06.
