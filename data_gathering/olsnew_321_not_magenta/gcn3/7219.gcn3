The long GRB 080122 (Hurley et al., GCN 7211) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=66764.605 s UT (18:32:44.605).

The burst light curve shows three multipeaked pulses with a total 
duration of ~150 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 6.35(-3.39, +3.50)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+6.768 s
of (4.80 +/- 0.95)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+112.384 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.27 +/- 0.10
and Ep = 259(-33, +46) keV (chi2 = 58.1/60 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.21(-0.11, +0.12),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.36(-0.68, +0.24),
the peak energy Ep = 227(-33, +43) keV (chi2 = 54.2/59 dof).

The spectrum of the most intense part (from T0 to T0+14.080 s) is well 
fitted (in the same range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha =  -1.00 +/- 0.07
and Ep = 341(-29, +35) keV (chi2 = 46.8/60 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields only an upper limit
on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.27.
The fluence of this part is (2.42+/-0.10)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
