Using the data set from T-100 to T+300 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of Swift-BAT GRB 050915 (trigger
#155242)  (Grupe, et al., GCN 3977).  The refined BAT ground position is
RA,Dec = 81.682d,-28.010d {5h26m43.7s,-28d0'36"} [J2000] +/- 1.4 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  This position is 25 arcsec from 
the XRT afterglow position reported in Kennea, et al. (GCN circ. 3979).  
The partial coding was 75%.

The light curve shows about seven 2-second long peaks from T-10 to 
T+20 sec and one more peak at about T+43 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 
53 +- 3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-8 to T+56 sec is well fit by a
simple power law.  The power law index is 1.36 +- 0.16.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 8.8 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak
photon flux measured from T+13.7 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
