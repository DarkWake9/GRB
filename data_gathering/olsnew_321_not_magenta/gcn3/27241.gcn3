C. Malacaria (NASA-MSFC/USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-200227A 
(GCN 27235), at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported 
neutrino location at:

RA, Dec: 348.26, +21.32 (J2000)
Error Radius: 30.80 arcmin, 90% PSF containment

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray 
bursts below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also 
identified no counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, 
the most sensitive, coherent search for GRB-like signals, 
was run from +/-30 s around the neutrino candidate time. 
From this search, no significant signal was found related 
to IceCube-200227A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in
arXiv:1612.02395, we set the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):
