We imaged the position of the GRB 050730 afterglow (Holland et al.
GCN 3704) with the Magellan Observatory Baade Telescope and IMACS
imaging spectrograph on 2005 Aug. 3 23:40 (UT) which is 99.7 hours
after the burst. Three,  300 sec exposures were obtained in the
R band and combined into a deep image. The afterglow (+possible host
galaxy) is detected and the brightness is estimated to be
R=23.4+/-0.1 mag based on the calibration by Holman et al. (GCN 3727).

The power-law decay index between the IMACS R-band observation obtained
3 hours after the burst and 100 hours is -1.5 which confirms the light
curve break suggested by Holman et al. (GCN 3727). We note that the
strong Lyman absorption (GCN 3709,3710,3716) falls at the peak of the
standard R-band transmission making comparison between magnitude
estimates made with different detector/filter combinations difficult.
