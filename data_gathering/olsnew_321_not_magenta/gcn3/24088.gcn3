and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) was operating at the trigger time
of S190408an (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration,
GCN Circ. 24069).  No CGBM on-board trigger occurred around the event time.
Based on the LIGO-Virgo localization sky map, most of the part of
the high probability area was in the field-of-view of CGBM.  The summed LIGO
probabilities inside the HXM and the SGM field of view are 91% and 95%.

Based on the analysis of the light curve data with 0.125 sec time resolution
from -60 sec to 60 sec from the trigger time, we found no significant excess
around the trigger time in either the HXM (7-3000 keV) or the SGM (40 keV -28 MeV)
data.

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in low energy trigger mode at the trigger
time of S190408an.  Using CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in
the 1-10 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no
candidates.  The 90% upper limit of CAL is 2.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2/s (1-10 GeV) when
the summed LIGO-Virgo probabilities reaches at 80%.
