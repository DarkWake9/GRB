TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  692
SUBJECT: GRB000604, optical observations

A. Diercks and I. Cotoros report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA
GRB collaboration:

We have examined our Gunn-r images of the GRB000604 error box
(Hurley et al, GCN #687) from June 6.24 - 6.28 UT (Cotoros et al, GCN
#688) and do not detect the object reported by Leibowitz (GCN #690).
The coordinates of Leibowitz's candidate fall within the overlap of
our two pointings and the combined image (5x500s) has a 5-sigma
detection limit measured relative to several USNO A2.0 stars of
approximately r ~ 22.0 +/- 0.2, though this calibration should be
considered preliminary pending more accurate photometry of the region.

We find for Leibowitz's Star A (as shown in the finding chart
http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~eran/GRB000604/) RA=15:35:52.6,10:41:08.8
+/- 1 arcsec measured against 58 USNO A2.0 stars.  At the resolution
of our images, Leibowitz's "Star B" is identifable as a galaxy.

In addition, we have re-imaged the entire IPN error box with the
Palomar 60" from June 7.26 - 7.30 UT in Gunn-r (5x500s).  Lebowitz's
object is not detected in our combined image which has a similar
limiting magnitude as the June 6 data.

Given the non-detection of Leibowitz's candidate in our data at epochs
which bracket the Wise observations, we believe this object is not
related to GRB000604.
