WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 140622A (D'Elia et al.,
GCN 16433) starting at 09:39:22 UT, 198 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect any new source in our
images within the enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne et al.,
GCN 16434). The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear
image is about 19.0 calibrated to USNO B1.0.
