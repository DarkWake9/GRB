 We have observed the optical transient (OT) of GRB020813 (Fox, Blake
& Price, GCN #1470) with the KISO observatory 1.05 m Schmidt
telescope.  We obtained four data sets for each B,V,R,I band during
2002 Aug. 13 10:52 to 16:46 UT.

 We detected the OT in the first data set of B (11:58-12:17 UT) ,
R(10:52-11:11 UT), I (11:14-11:33 UT). Due to the bad weather
condition, we could not detect it in V band. A preliminary analysis
suggests that the OT is at R=19 in comparison with the USNO-A2.0 star
(U0675_34232257).  Analysis of the full data set is underway.
