Peter Nelson (Ellinbank, Victoria, Australia) reports to the AAVSO 
International High Energy Network the following optical observation of 
GRB081109A (GCN #8500 Immler et al.; GCN #8501 D'Avanzo et al.):

Peter Nelson has obtained a limiting magnitude on the optical afterglow of 
GRB081109A (Immler et al., GCN #8500).  The near IR afterglow position RA: 
22:03:09.72 Dec: -54:42:39.5 found by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN #8501) was observed 
for 120 seconds using a 0.32-meter Newtonian with an SBIG ST8XE 
CCD and an R filter under poor photometric conditions.  The mid-point of 
the observations was 2008 Nov 09.5188 UT, approximately 5.4 hours after the 
burst.  The afterglow was not detected to an upper limit of R=18.1, using 
the USNO-A2.0 star 0300-37476396 (R=13.2) as the comparison.
