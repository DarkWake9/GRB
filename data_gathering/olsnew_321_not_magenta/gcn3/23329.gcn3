and the CALET collaboration:

The MAXI GRB 181011A (Kawakubo et al., GCN Circ. 23327) was detected
in ground analysis of the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data
near the MAXI trigger time at T0=03:36:12 UT on 11 October 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked emission episode which 
starts at T+21 sec and ends at T+55 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
31 +- 8 sec and 15 +- 8 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
