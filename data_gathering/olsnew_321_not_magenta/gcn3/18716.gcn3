S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:19:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located V 404 Cyg (trigger=668097).  Swift did not slew due to a low merit value. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 306.024, +33.874, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 24m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 52' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical with image triggers, the real-time 
light curve does not show anything. 

This is a known source, and as such the assigned merit value was low enough
to not allow an immediate slew.  Swift will slew to this source at 06:37 UT.
