SGR 1806-20: GMRT results at 240 MHz band.

P. Chandra on behalf of GMRT observatory reports the detection of
radio emission from the SGR 1806-20 with the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) in the 235 MHz band (resolution 12"-18")
on the  following dates:

 240 MHz:

 2005 Jan 4.41 UT:   465.8 +/- 28.3 mJy
 2005 Jan 6.38 UT:   462.3 +/- 29.1 mJy
 2005 Jan 7.25 UT:   231.0 +/- 20.2 mJy
 2005 Jan 8.24 UT:   249.6 +/- 17.1 mJy
 2005 Jan 9.26 UT:   175.5 +/- 19.8 mJy
 2005 Jan 10.16 UT:  155.4 +/- 08.5 mJy
 2005 Jan 26.26 UT:  103.9 +/- 31.0 mJy

The values quoted here are after subtracting the nearby extended emission
contribution from the SGR and doing the Tsys corection by a factor of
3.875 at 240 MHz frequency. Tsys correction is required because of the
different sky temperatures off the galactic plane (position of SGR) and
off the galactic plane (Flux calibrator).

The 608 flux density on Jan 10.16 UT and Jan 26.26 UT are 82.4 +/- 6.8 mJy
and 19.3 +/- 5.9 mJy, after doing the Tsys correction by a factor of 1.87.
