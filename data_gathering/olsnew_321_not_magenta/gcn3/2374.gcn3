K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and RHESSI observed this GRB
at 67051 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 20 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
9.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 162.440,  22.068 degrees, whose radius is 46.082 +/-  0.017
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival direction to ecliptic latitudes greater than 44
degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus north of RA, Decl
(2000)=133, +64 degrees and 213.5, +34 degrees.

This localization can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
