In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger event G299232 at T0 = 2017-08-25
13:13:37.983 UTC (GCN #21693), we performed an analysis of the AGILE
Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different  timescales. On LIGO/Virgo
trigger time (T0) the GRID exposure covered nearly 42% of the LIGO/Virgo
localization region (at 90% confidence level; LR), observed at off-axis
angles between 20 and 55 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0.
Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (ULs) obtained within the
accessible LIGO/Virgo 3-sigma LR are reported below:

from 1.5e-06 to 7.8e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s
from 1.5e-07 to 7.8e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 20s
from 3.9e-08 to 2.2e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
