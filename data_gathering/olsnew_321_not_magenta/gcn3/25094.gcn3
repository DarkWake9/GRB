The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data around
the time of the compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidate S190630ag
(GCN 24922). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.offline.fits.gz,
distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the
GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190630ag

LALInference.offline.fits.gz is the preferred sky map at this time.
The 90% credible region is 1483 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky,
the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 926 ± 259 Mpc
(a posteriori mean ± standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents
of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
