D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 23 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 10:04:58  UT of July 1st, 2019.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 350.4091 deg
DEC.= +64.3457 deg
with an uncertainty of  1.1 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.1  photons/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration  time) 
and a fluence in the same energy range of about 5.e-8 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
