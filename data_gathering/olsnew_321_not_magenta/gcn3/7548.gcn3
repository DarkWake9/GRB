The long GRB 080328 (Swift-BAT trigger #307931: Perri et al., GCN
7525, Krimm et al., GCN 7533)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=28982.306 s UT (08:03:02.306).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
with a total duration of ~90 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.23(-0.22, +0.23)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+10.512 s
of (2.51 +/- 0.41)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+90.368 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV-1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.13(-0.20, +0.17),
and Ep = 289(-57, +93) keV (chi2 = 62.8/56 dof).

The spectrum of the most intense part (from T0+8.448 to T0+16.640 s)
is well fitted (in the same range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha =  -0.59(-0.19, +0.17)
and Ep = 338(-40, +51) keV (chi2 = 60.8/56 dof).
The fluence of this part is (8.79 +/- 0.68)x10^-6 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
