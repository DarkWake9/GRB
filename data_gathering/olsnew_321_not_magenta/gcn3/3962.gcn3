TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3962
SUBJECT: GRB 050911: z~0.16 cluster in the field

E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) reports:

"The position of GRB 050911 is located about 3.5 arcmin from the center of
a galaxy cluster (EDCC 493; diameter ~ 20 arcmin).  Several galaxies in
this field have a redshift of about 0.165, measured in the Las Campanas
Redshift Survey (LCRS).  If GRB 050911 is a short burst (as may be
indicated by the initial short duration pulses; GCN 3961), then it is
possible that it is associated with EDCC 493, and is therefore located at
z~0.16.  We note that the prompt emission exhibits a second peak at t+10
to t+20 sec (GCN 3961), but this may be a softer component as observed in
GRBs 050709 and 050724."
