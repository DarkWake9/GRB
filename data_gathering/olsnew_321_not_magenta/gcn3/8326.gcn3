Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 081003 detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 5361) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

2008-10-03T20:48:45.809

The observations started 29.7s after the GRB trigger
(7s after the notice) when the gamma emission was
still active. The elevation of the field decreased
from 41 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-10-03T20:48:16.09

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT at the position provived
by Gotz (GCNC 8317) with a limiting magnitude of:

t0+29.7s to t0+89.7s : R > 16.9

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+97.0s to t0+127.0s : R > 17.4

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 48.80 lat= +5.63
and the galactic extinction in R band is 2.0 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
