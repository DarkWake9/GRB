P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the Swift burst GRB 071122 (GCN 7121) using the VLA at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. The observations were taken at 22.46 UT on 2007,
November 24. We detect a radio emission at the P60 afterglow position (GCN
7123, 7125). The flux density at the P60 position is 255 +/- 45 uJy.
