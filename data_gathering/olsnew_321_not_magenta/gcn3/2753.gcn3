TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2753
SUBJECT: GRB040924,optical observation

E. Pavlenko, S. Sergeev,  V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We observed  the field of the optical afterglow candidate (Fox and Moon, GCN
2734) of GRB 040924  (=H3564, Fenimore et al., GCN 2735) in the R (Johnson)
band with APOGEE 47 on the 38-cm Cassegrain telescope of the Crimean
Astrophysical Observatory.

The observations were started at Sep. 24, 20:21 UT (i.e. 8.48 hours after
the burst) and continued up to Sep.24, 23.13 UT. The sum of the first 3
images
(3x190-s) yield the limiting magnitude 19.7 +- 0.2. No optical counterpart
at the position proposed by Fox and Moon was found. For the sum of last
7x240 images  taken between Sep. 24 23:08 - 23:46 UT  no counterpart fainter
than 21.0 +- 0.2 was detected. The limiting magnitudes were estimated in
comparison of the USNO-B1.0 stars as photometric sequences. The limits are
in agreement with OT magnitude estimation in simultaneous observation of
I.Khamitov et al. (GCN 2749).
