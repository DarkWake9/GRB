At 17:52:17 UT on 17 Sep 2016, the Lomonosov BDRG  Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor  (http://lomonosov.sinp.msu.ru/en/scientific-equipment-2/bdrg )
triggered GRB 161017A (E. Troja et al.,, GCN 20064).
GRB 161017A has several peaks LC, total duration ~100s,the energy range
70-300 keV.

MASTER-Amur  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB161017A 21 sec after 
notice time and 47 sec after Swift trigger time at 2016-10-17 17:52:38 UT 
in two polarizations. 
On  our first (10s exposure)  set we  marginally found  optical transient 
at  Yurkov et al. (GCN 20063) and Troja et al. (GCN 20064) position.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14.5 mag .
The OT was became brighter up to maximum at 3-4  set .

The observations made on zenit distance = 53 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
47 degree.
The moon (96 % bright part) is 50 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 87
The sun  altitude  is -37.8 degree.


MASTER-Tunka  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka (Baykal lake) was pointed to the  GRB161017.74 75 sec 
after notice time 
and 103 sec after trigger time at 2016-10-17 17:53:34 UT. On our second 
(20s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box (ra=09 31 03 dec=+43 08 31 r=0.050000).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 12.5 mag.

The observations made on zenit distance = 65 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
47 degree.
The moon (96 % bright part) is 50 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 87 degrees.
The sun  altitude  is -45.9 degrees.
The low mahnitude limit because dense fog due to Irkut (Famost Sibirian 
river) evaporation.

We imaged OT late.

MASTER-IAC  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located at Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Canary, Spain) was pointed to the 
GRB161017A  32942 sec after trigger time at 2016-10-18 03:00:53 UT. On our 
first (180s exposure)  set we found optical transient  on coaded images.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.8 mag

The observations made on zenit distance = 69 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
47 degrees. The moon (94 % bright part) is 75 degrees above the horizon. 
The distance  between  moon and  object is 82 degrees.
The sun  altitude  is -54.1 degree.

Our preliminary photometry is next:
