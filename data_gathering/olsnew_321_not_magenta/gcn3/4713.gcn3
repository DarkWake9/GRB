M. Nysewander, J. Harvey, A. Foster, D. Reichart, J. A. Crain, K. Ivarsen,
and A. LaCluyze report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:

We observed the localization of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN 4682) with
the 14.5-inch Trubble Terrestrial Telescope (TTT) in the mountains west of
Fort Collins, Colorado, in red and green filters beginning 27.1 hours after
the burst under the automated control of Skynet:

Filter  Start (UT)  Stop (UT)  Exposures  Total (hr)
Red     07:54:35    08:50:41   14 x 160s  0.62
Green   09:20:34    11:12:58   35 x 160s  1.56

TTT is the first non-PROMPT telescope on Skynet.  Between 27.1 and 28.5
hours after the burst, these observations were taken in synch with PROMPT
observations (Kirschbrown et al., GCN 4712).

We do not detect the afterglow (Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) to R > 18.5 mag (3
sigma) at an effective time of 27.6 hours after the burst (calibrated to 5
USNO-B1.0 stars).
