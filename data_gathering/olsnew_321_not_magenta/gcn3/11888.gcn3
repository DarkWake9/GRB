R. Ruffini, L. Izzo, A.V. Penacchioni, C.L. Bianco (ICRANet, ICRA and Rome University "La Sapienza") report:

From theoretical considerations on the transparency of the P-GRB (between t0 and t0+6 s), we infer for GRB 110402A a redshift z between 2.02 and 2.48. We strongly encourage a spectroscopic identification of the redshift.
