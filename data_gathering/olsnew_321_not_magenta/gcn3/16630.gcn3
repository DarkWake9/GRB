FROM:    Cristiano Guidorzi at Ferrara U,Italy  <guidorzi@fe.infn.it>

C. Guidorzi, S. Dichiara (U. Ferrara), C.G. Mundell (LJMU)
on behalf of a large collaboration report:

 From the analysis of the finally reduced frames we retract the
uncatalogued source reported in our previous message
(GCN Circ. 16627) as the possible optical afterglow candidate
to GRB 140723A. The source turned out to be not real.
We apologise for the confusion.
