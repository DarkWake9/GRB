MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB140108A 22 sec after notice 
time and 39 sec after trigger time at 2014-01-08 17:19:21.913 UT in two 
polarizations. On our first (10s exposure) set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within SWIFT error-box ( Racusin et al. GCN 15699 ).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.0 mag.

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the 
GRB140108A 30 sec after notice time and 47 sec after trigger time at 
2014-01-08 17:19:29.211 UT  in two polarizations. On our first (10s 
exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.0 mag.

The polarizations filters oriented by RA and DEC axis (0 and 90 degrees 
from RA axis) in Kislovodsk, and 45 and 135 degrees from RA axis in 
Blagoveschensk.


The OT candidate apeared in two sites (Blagoveschensk and Kislovodsk) and 
at 2014-01-08 17:19:42 at position:

(J2000) 
RA =  21 40 26.77 
Dec = +58 44 41.4
Error=+-1 arcsc sigma
