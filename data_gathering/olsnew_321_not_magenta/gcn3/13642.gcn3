Peter Jenke (MSFC/NPP) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:34:55.09 UT on 11 August 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120811C (trigger 366392098 / 120811649)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et al. 2012, GCN 13622).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 133 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse 
with a duration (T90) of about 14.3 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.14 s to T0+10.24 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.  
The power law index is -0.71 +/- 0.20 and the cutoff energy, 
parameterized as Epeak, is 54 +/- 3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.98 +/- 0.08)E-06 ergs/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.072 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.9304 +/- 0.55  ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
