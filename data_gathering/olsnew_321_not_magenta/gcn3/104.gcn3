GRB980613: follow-up with NFI:

Luigi Piro on behalf of the BeppoSAX team report:


Two previously unknown X-ray sources have been found in the WFC error
circle by the MECS during the follow up observation started 9 hrs after
the GRB.

Source A is at
R.A.(2000)= 10h17m53s
Dec.(2000)= +71d27'24"

Source B is at
R.A.(2000)= 10h18m04s
Dec.(2000)= +71d33'30"

The error radius is 50".

Source B does not show substantial variability.
Source A shows a rather strong decay during the observation, and is very
likely the X-ray afterglow of GB980613.
