P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have performed a second epoch observation with Swift-XRT of GRB
101114A (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 11405). This observation was 5.5 ks
in length, beginning 3.5 days after the GRB trigger. The source reported
by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 11406) is still detected, but has faded
significantly to a level of 1.6 (+/- 0.9) x 10^-3 ct/sec. We thus
confirm that this is the afterglow of GRB 101114A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
