In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190707q at T0 = 2019-07-07 09:33:26.181
(UT) (GCN #25012), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE data at T0 shows that the
Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered more than 25% of the 90% c.l.
localization region (LR), observed at off-axis angles between 25 and 50 deg.

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV at T0,
where good exposure of the S190707q 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are obtained:

(T0-2s; T0+2s): from 1.3e-06 to 5.3e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 with a 27% coverage of the 90% c.l. LR;

(T0; T0+10s); from 6.9e-07 to 9.8e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 with a 26% coverage of the 90% c.l. LR;

(T0; T0+100s); from 4.3e-07 to 8.9e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 with a 65% coverage of the 90% c.l. LR.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
