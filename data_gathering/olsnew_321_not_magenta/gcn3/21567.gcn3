We report a correction to the photometric magnitude of SSS17a announced in LVC GCN 21529.  After re-examination of the imaging and using 97 APASS i' standards for relative photometry, we conclude that the source had a brightness of i = 17.3 +/- 0.1 mag at the time of observation on UT 2017-08-17.98.  We apologize for the error.
