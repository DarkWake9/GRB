SUBJECT: GRB 041006: Optical decay

P.A. Price (IfA, UH), G. Da Costa (MSO) and N. Noel (IAC) report:

Preliminary analysis of six V-band frames from the SSO 40-inch from Oct
6.54 UT (t_GRB + 35 min) to 6.59 UT (t_GRB + 120 min) reveal that the
afterglow has a temporal decay index of alpha ~ 0.7 over these
observations, with an estimated magnitude of R ~ 18.5 mag at Oct 6.59
UT.

Assuming this decay holds, this predicts the GRB should be roughly R ~
20 mag at local midnight, US Eastern daylight savings time (UTC-4h).

The afterglow is also detected in the B band.
