The long bright GRB 190329A (IPN triangulation: Hurley et al.,
GCN Circ. 24029) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 06:21:49.627 UTC on 29 March 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows two multi-peaked pulses separated by
a quiescent interval. The first pulse starts at T=0.4 sec,
peaks at 1.4 sec and ends at T+2.0 sec; the second starts at T=11.0 sec,
peaks at 11.8 sec and ends at T+16.9 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 14.2 +- 1.2 sec
and 10.8 +- 0.2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
