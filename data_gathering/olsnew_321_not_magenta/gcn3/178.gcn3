L. Piro on behalf of the BeppoSAX team report:

A follow-up with the NFI of GB981226 started yesterday Dec.26
around 20:34 U.T.

Preliminary analysis of the LECS and MECS detectors for the first 6 orbits
shows a previously unknown source (a few x 10**-13 erg/cm2/s) within the
WFC error box. 

Preliminary position is:
R.A.(2000)= 352.40
DEC(2000)= -23.93
i.e. 1.2' from the center of the WFC error box 
The error radius is 1.5'.

At this stage of the observation we cannot yet establish whether the
source is fading.  The observation will finish tomorrow evening.
