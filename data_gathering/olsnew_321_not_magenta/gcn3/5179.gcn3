Christina C. Thoene, Johan P.U. Fynbo (DARK Cosmology Centre), Uffe G.
Joergensen (NBI Copenhagen) report:


We observed the OT of GRB060526 (GCN 5162, GCN 5166) with the Danish 1.54m
telescope and DFOSC on La Silla in the R-band at several epochs on May 26
and May 27.

A fit to our data from the first night gives a powerlaw decay with a
temporal decay index of 0.86, whereas the data obtained at the second
night are well fitted by a powerlaw with index 1.73. Therefore, in
contrast to the flattening reported in GCN 5177, we observe a considerable
steepening of the lightcurve between the first and the second night and a
possible break between the two nights.

A plot of the data and fit is available at:
