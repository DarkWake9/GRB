SUBJECT: Correction to GCN Circular 21337: GRB 170710D CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor detection

T. Sakamoto (AGU) and the CALET collaboration

We named the GRB wrongly in our previous GCN circular (Tamura et al.
GCN Circ. 21337).  The correct GRB name is GRB 170710D not GRB 170710C
(since GRB 170710C was already named for the GRB detected by INTEGRAL
on 05:05:15 UT; Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 21326).  Apologies for any
confusion caused.

We would like to thank Sandro Mereghetti for pointing out this error.
