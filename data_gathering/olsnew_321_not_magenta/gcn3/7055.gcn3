TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7055
SUBJECT: VLA IInd observation of INTEGRAL burst GRB 071109

P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the INTEGRAL burst GRB 071109 again using the VLA at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. The observations were taken at 0.87 UT on 2007,
November 11th. We do not detect any radio emission at the position of our
last detection (GCN 7049). The flux density limit is 33+/-28 uJy. This
probably means that either our 10th November radio detection was not real
or it was detection from the reverse shock, which faded away by now. We
still do not detect any source at Swift-XRT position (GCN 7050).
