and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170710D (Konus-Wind trigger time on
19:12:50.635 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 19:12:50.84 on 10 July 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM
instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a bright single peak.  The emission starts at
T+2 sec, peaks at T+5 sec and ends at T+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 4.9 +- 0.3 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
