Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin, on

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

This burst (GCN 1706, 1707) was also observed by Konus.  We have
triangulated it to an improved, but still preliminary 3 sigma error box
whose approximate area is 72 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000) 
ERROR BOX CENTER: 19 h 47 m  25.93 s     28 o 16 '   0.45 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 19 h 46 m 45.23 s     28 o  8 '  57.88 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 19 h 47 m 33.79 s     28 o 20 '  50.43 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 19 h 47 m 18.08 s     28 o 11 '  10.45 " 
ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 19 h 48 m 06.73 s     28 o 23 '  02.41 "

This error box is fully contained within the INTEGRAL error circle and
overlaps the previous IPN error box (GCN 1707), but about 10 square
arcminutes in this new box are not included in the old one.  A map
showing the two new triangulation annuli, the INTEGRAL error circle,
and the old error box, is being posted to
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/021125.

This error box may be improved.
