We observed the field of the Swift/BAT GRB 210402A (Page et al., GCN Circ.
29743) with the DDOTI wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) from 2021-04-03 02:52
UTC to 2021-04-03 12:18 UTC (from 4.8 to 14.2 hours after the trigger).

We observed a region covering aproximately 7 degrees in RA and 10 degrees in
declination (about 70 square degrees), including the XRT position in the w
filter, and obtained 23ks of exposure. We calibrated our images against the
APASS catalog.

Compared to the USNO-B1, Pan-STARRS DR1, and APASS DR10 catalogs, we do not
detect a source at the X-ray position to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of w =
23.2.

Our non-detection is consistent with the non-detections reported by Zhu et al.
(GCN Circ. 29745) and Leonini et al. (GCN Circ. 29747).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
