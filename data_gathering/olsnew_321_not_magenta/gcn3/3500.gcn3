enunciate sadly

that the optical candidate reported by ourselves in previous
GCN (Jelinek et al., GCN3498) is in fact a star, which is not
present in GSC2 catalogue. This mislead me (MJ) and although
doing a double-check using DSS, I have missed the star, thus
convincing myself about reality of the object.

We apologize to the comunity for a false alert.

Anyhow: The BOOTES-1B has observed the errorbox starting 71s
after the trigger in a light twilight, setting the limit to
the possible GRB counterpart to V>13.8 and I>13.0 during the
first 60s after the beginning of our observation.
