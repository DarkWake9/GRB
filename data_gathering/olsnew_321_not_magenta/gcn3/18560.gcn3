Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We reobserved the position of several iPTF transients (all of the ones
reported in
Palliyaguru et al. GCN 18528 except for iPTF15dmn) located in the error
region of
LIGO/Virgo G194575 (Singer et al. GCN 18442, 18497), with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA) in its D configuration. The observations started on 15-Nov-04
03:06:16 UT,
ended on 15-Nov-4 05:15:56 UT, and were carried out in C-band (central
frequency ~6 GHz). Analysis is ongoing and further observations are planned.
