WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift Trigger 704327
(Sbarufatti et al.,  GCN 19700) 451 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect the possible optical
afterglow reported by Gorbovskoy et al. (GCN 17729) in our single
images, nor in the co-added image from the first 10 clear images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
19.5 calibrated to USNO B1.0, and the limiting magnitude of
the co-added images is about 20.8 at a mean time of 909s.
This is consistent with the report by Sakamoto et al. (GCN 19707)
that the trigger is due to a noise fluctuation.
