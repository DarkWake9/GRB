TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: BATSE location of GRB000126

R. M. Kippen (UAH/MSFC) reports on behalf of the BATSE GRB Team:

GRB000126 was detected by BATSE as trigger #7971 at 84389.625 s UT on
2000 January 26.  BACODINE/GCN locations were not issued because the
trigger began in a real-time telemetry gap.  The burst emission
consists of several pulses lasting more than 70 s.  The preliminary
BATSE location is (R.A., Dec. J2000) = (116.7, 6.9 deg), with a total
(statistical+systematic) error radius of 2.4 deg (68% Conf.).  This
location rules out one of the two possible IPN error boxes (GCN 525),
which means that the most probable IPN error-box is:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  7 h 45 m 40.70 s      7 o 53 '  53.12 "
  7 h 44 m 42.48 s      7 o 43 '   2.86 "
  7 h 45 m 16.97 s      7 o 45 '  38.87 "
  7 h 44 m 18.05 s      7 o 34 '  38.23 "

This box is within about 0.8 deg of the independent BATSE location.
