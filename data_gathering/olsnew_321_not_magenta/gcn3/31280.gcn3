The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:26:12 UT on 22 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211222A (trigger 661890377.228366 / 211222768).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 103.4, Dec = -53.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 53m, -53d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 20.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64.0 degrees.
