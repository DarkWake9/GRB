We began to observe GRB121108A ( Ukwatta  et al., GCN 13952 ) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at  17:49:47 (UT), about 128s after 
the burst.  A series of white and R-band images were obtained. 
No any optical counterpart was found in the X-ray errorbox 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 13959).  The 3 sigma upper limit is about 19.9 
mag in R-band calibrated by USNO B1.0 R2 mag,  at the mean 
time of 58 min after the burst.
