The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S190517h during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-05-17
05:51:01.831 UTC (GPS time: 1242107479.831). The candidate was found
by the GstLAL [1], CWB [2], MBTAOnline [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR
[5] analysis pipelines.

S190517h is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 2.4e-09 Hz, or about one in 13
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190517h

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (98%), MassGap (2%), NSBH (<1%), Terrestrial
(<1%), or BNS (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong
evidence against the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar
masses (HasNS: <1%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the
signal, there is strong evidence against matter outside the final
compact object (HasRemnant: <1%).

One skymap is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 35 minutes after the candidate

For the bayestar.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 939
deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity
distance estimate is 2950 +/- 1038 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/-
standard deviation).
