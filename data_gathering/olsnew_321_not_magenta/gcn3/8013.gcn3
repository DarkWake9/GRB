Mark H. Wieringa (CSIRO), Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail
(NRAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a region centered on the bright INTEGRAL-  and
Super-AGILE-detected GRB 080723B (GCN 8002 and 8003) using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array starting at July 23.97 UT and ending at
July 24.13 UT. No radio emission was seen at 8 GHz frequency band
within the XRT error circle (GCN 8008). The flux upper limit at XRT
position is 170 uJy (rms 67 uJy).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia
Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
