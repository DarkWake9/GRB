Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge reports on behalf of
the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Team:

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 250533995 at 16:46:34.31 UT
on 09 December 2008, tentatively classified by the GBM flight software as a
GRB, is in fact not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source. This
trigger is probably due to a coincidental chance fluctuation in two GBM
detectors.
