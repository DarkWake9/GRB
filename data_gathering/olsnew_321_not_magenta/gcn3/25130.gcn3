report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 14:58:34.56 UT on 19 July 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190719C (trigger 585241119/ 190719624),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Ambrosi et al. 2019, GCN 25106).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 86 degrees.

The GBM lightcurve shows an initial bright short spike followed
by longer duration emission containing multiple peaks.
with a duration (T90) of about 175 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.0 s to T0+3.0 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.87 +/- 0.18 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 81 +/- 9 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.155 +/- 0.082)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T+0.19 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
