We have analysed 6.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 200711A (Marshall et al.
GCN Circ. 28078), from 150 s to 40.4 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 29 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 10 s were
taken while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. Using 1145 s of PC mode data and 2 UVOT images, we find an
enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT
field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 285.97020, -0.14708
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 19h 03m 52.85s
Dec(J2000): -00d 08' 49.5"

with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=0.51 (+0.13, -0.14), followed by a break at T+3349 s to
an alpha of 1.41 (+/-0.09).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.01 (+0.22, -0.21). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.65 (+0.30, -0.27) x 10^22 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 5.7 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 5.6 x 10^-11 (1.2 x 10^-10) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.65 (+0.30, -0.27) x 10^22 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 5.7 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 6.5 sigma
Photon index:	     2.01 (+0.22, -0.21)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.41, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 9.6 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.4 x
10^-13 (1.1 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
