P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU),
A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 12:02:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on a location
near NGC 2559 (trigger=607945).  Swift did not slew because of Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 124.350, -27.332 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 17m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 19' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical with image triggers, there is nothing
to be seen in the real-time TDRSS lightcurve.  Further, this is a sub-threshold
trigger (because of the spatial coincidence with the galaxy in the on-board catalog)
and as such of low confidence. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:34 UT on 2014 August 22. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

This was a low significance BAT trigger in the direction of NGC 2559. 
Since the field is Sun constrained there will be no XRT or UVOT data
to further ascertain the nature of the trigger, which is likely the
result of a noise fluctuation.
