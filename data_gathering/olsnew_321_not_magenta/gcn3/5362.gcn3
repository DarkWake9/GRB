B. E. Cobb, part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 060728
(Pagani et al. GCN 5360) with a mid-exposure time of ~6.8 hours
post-burst (2006-07-29 05:13 UT).  Optical imaging in V and I has a
field of view of 6'x6' and, therefore, covers the entire GRB
error circle.  IR imaging in J and K has a smaller field
of view (2.4'x2.4') and covers a region totaling 5.8 square arcminutes in
the middle of the quoted BAT error region.  Total summed exposure
times amounted to 15 minutes in I and V and 12 minutes in J and K.

Preliminary visual comparison of the optical and IR images to the DSS
does not reveal any new sources.  Our I-band limiting magnitude
is I ~ 22  (in comparison with several USNO-B1.0 stars).  Our J-band
images does not contain any 2MASS stars, but the few sources detected in
the J-band image are all consistent with sources found in the DSS.
