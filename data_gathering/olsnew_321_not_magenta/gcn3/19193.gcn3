Liu Jinzhong (XAO), on behalf of the NOWT group report:
We followed up the GraceDB event (event ID: G194575) with Nanshan One-meter Wide field Telescope (NOWT) from Xinjiang Astronomical observatory (XAO). The first observation was observed at 10/29/2015, GMT 19/15/51. The first observation reached an exposure time of 120 seconds with V band and approached a limiting magnitude of 20.3 magnitude. 40 of *.fit files of this field were obtained and the time of duration was 1680 s. We only report the first observation here, more information will be reported later.


We monitored the sky region constantly since the event, and we anticipated to continue the observation. We observed the range (just about FOV of 15 sqr deg due to very small possibility-map at northern sky) and here reported a non-detection of EM-trigger with a time span of 2.48 h  with limiting magnitude of 20.3
