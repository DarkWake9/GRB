Kerry Paterson (Northwestern), Michael J. Lundquist, David J. Sand (UA), Wen-fai Fong, Jillian Rastinejad (Northwestern), Jennifer Andrews (UA), Sam Wyatt (UA), Eric Christensen, Alex Gibbs, Frank Shelly (UA/LPL), report on behalf of the SAGUARO collaboration:

We initiated observations of 12 fields (each 5 deg^2, totalling 60 deg^2) within the LVC localization region for the GW trigger S190930s (LVC Circ 25871) starting on 2019-10-01 02:09:22 UT (0.52 days after the GW trigger) with the 1.5m Catalina Sky Survey telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ. 

Below are the field centers observed.

We have posted our pointings to the Treasure Map, and encourage others to do the same:

Performing image subtraction, we find no new transients within the 60 deg^2 searched down to a 3-sigma limit of G~21.3 AB mag (calibrated to Gaia DR2) relative to deep CSS reference images.
