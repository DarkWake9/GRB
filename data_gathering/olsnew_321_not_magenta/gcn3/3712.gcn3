Nysewander report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically observed the localization
of GRB 050730 (Holland et al., GCN 3704) beginning 3.1 hours after the
burst in repeating blocks of VRcIc.

We detect the afterglow (Holland et al., GCN 3704; Cobb et al., GCN 3708).
At 3.3 hours after the burst, we measure Rc = 17.82 +/- 0.05, based on 3
USNO-B1.0 stars.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
