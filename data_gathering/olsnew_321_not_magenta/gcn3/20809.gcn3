We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of EM
candidates originally reported in GCN #20790. Observations were made with
the SPRAT spectrograph, and supernova classifications were obtained using
SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).


iPTF17bqh was observed on 2017-03-02 at 23:58UT. The spectrum is generally
featureless with some weak hints of Balmer lines in absorption, so we
believe this source to be a dwarf nova in outburst.

iPTF17bpt was observed on 2017-03-03 at 02:12UT. Based on a
weather-affected spectrum we classify this transient as a type Ia SN at +18
days with z=0.595.
