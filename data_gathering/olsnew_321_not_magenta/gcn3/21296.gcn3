Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170705A (trigger #760064)
(Starling et al., GCN Circ. 21289).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 191.708, 18.298 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 46m 50.0s 
  Dec(J2000) = +18d 17' 51.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 83%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~ T0 and ends at ~ T+300 s. The main emission occurs at ~ T0 to ~ T+40 s, 
with the major peak at ~ T+14 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 217.3 +- 18.0 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.44 to T+304.86 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.65 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.5 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+13.41 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 13.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
