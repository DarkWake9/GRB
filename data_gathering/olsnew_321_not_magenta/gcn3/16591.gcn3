A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR) and Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) reports:

We carried out Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 140703A  (GCN 16503) in the 1390 MHz band on 2013 July 10.12 UT and 
12.91 UT,
respectively. We do not detect the radio afterglow of the GRB in this 
frequency.
The 3-sigma upper limit at the two epochs are 174 and 177 uJy, 
respectively. The map resolutions
of the two images are 2.5"x2.0" and 3.1"x2.1", respectively.

We thank GMRT staff for making these observations possible.
