At 00:10:07.00 on April 02, 2014, Fermi-LAT detected
high-energy emission from GRB 140402A,
which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 418090209/140402007).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec  207.47, 5.87 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.20 deg
(90% containment, statistical error only).
This position was 13 deg from the LAT boresight
at the time of the trigger and is consistent
with the last GBM ground location.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase
in the event rate within 10 degrees of the GBM location
after the GBM trigger that is spatially and temporally
correlated with the GBM emission with high significance.
More than 10 photons above 100 MeV
are observed within 800 seconds.
The highest-energy photon is a 3.5 GeV event which is
observed 6.8 seconds after the GBM trigger.
These numbers may increase as more data become
available.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elisabetta Bissaldi (Elisabetta.Bissaldi@ts.infn.it).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
