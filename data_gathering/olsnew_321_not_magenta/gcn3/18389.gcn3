the Swift Team:

At 18:09:04 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151004A (trigger=657564).  Swift did not slew due to the
Earth-limb observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 213.585, -64.947, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 14m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 56' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time
light curve does not show anything significant. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+56.9
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. B. Cenko (brad.cenko AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
