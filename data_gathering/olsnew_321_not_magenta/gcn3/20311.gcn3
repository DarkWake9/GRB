report for the POLAR collaboration:

At 2016-12-17T03:53:15 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground 
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 161217C, 
which was also detected by the IPN-KW.

The POLAR light curve consists of two peaks,
with a duration (T90) of 6.409 s measured from T0-2.8525 s.
The 0.5s peak rate measured from T0+3.0s is 1733 cnts/s,
The total counts is about 4364 cnts.Â  The above measurements are
in the energy range of about 80-500 keV.

All the analysis results presented above are preliminary.
Calibration of the instrument is ongoing.

POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter (50-500 keV) on-board 
the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 launched on Sep 15, 2016. More
