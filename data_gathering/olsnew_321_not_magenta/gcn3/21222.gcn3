LIGO/VIRGO G288732: Fermi GBM Observations

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the GBM-LIGO Group:
Lindy Blackburn (CfA), Michael S. Briggs (UAH), Jacob Broida (Carleton
College), E. Burns (USRA), Jordan Camp (NASA/GSFC), Tito Dal Canton

At the G288732 event time, GBM was observing 89% of the LIGO Bayestar
probability map and viewing the entire unocculted sky approximately 67
degrees from Earth center (RA = 197.9, DEC  = +19.5).

There was a single GBM on-board trigger within 1 hour of event time.
However, this trigger was due to a terrestrial gamma-ray flash and
unrelated to the G288732 event. The untargeted ground-based search of GBM
data for short-duration GRBs (Briggs et al., in prep) found no candidates
close in time to G288732.

The targeted search of the GBM data ([1], [2]) also did not find a
significant gamma-ray signal. This search processes time scales of 0.256 to
8.192 s within 30 s of the LIGO event. No interesting gamma-ray candidate
was found within this time window.

Further analysis and upper limits will be reported later.
