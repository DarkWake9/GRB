on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of
Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations

We serendipitously observed the localization region of the gravitational
wave trigger S200105ae (LVC, GCN #26640) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope
equipped with the 47 square degree Zwicky Transient Facility camera (ZTF,
Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) during the regular ZTF survey (i.e.,
without triggering further ToO observations in addition to those described
in Anand et al, GCN #26662). The images were processed in real-time through
the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al.
2019).

We queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al., 2019) and
AMPEL (Nordin et al., 2019), requiring at least 2 detections separated by
at least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we
cross-matched our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known
asteroids. We require that no spatially coincident ZTF alert has been
issued before the detection time of S200105ae. New candidates were found
within the 95% probability contour of S200105ae, in addition to those
reported by Stein et al. (GCN #26673). The new transient candidates are
presented in the table below.

Additional comments:
ZTF20aafexle has red color g-r~0.5 mag
ZTF20aaevbzl is fading in g-band about ~0.15 mag per day.
ZTF20aafkkoy is a hostless transient rising in r-band.

Future observations are planned and we encourage follow-up.
