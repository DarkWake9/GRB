V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya and V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed clear detection of GRB161203A (CALET detection: T. Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 20240) in the 40-200 keV 
energy range. The light curve shows a single peak structure with main peak at 18:41:10.32 UT, ~3 secs after the CALET trigger at 18:41:07.71 
UT. The measured peak count rate is 334.36 counts/sec above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 942.45 counts. 
The local mean background count rate was 322.63 counts/sec. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 8.6 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium
of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated 
the project.
