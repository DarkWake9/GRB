D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey - HEND, and RHESSI observed this ~25 s long
burst at 66246 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered at RA, Decl (2000) = 342.257, -9.639 degrees, whose radius is
50.513 +/- 0.446 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic
latitude response limits the arrival direction to ecliptic latitudes
between -50 and -20 degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus
between RA, Decl = 23, -46 and 34, -8 degrees, and 297, -41 and 355,
-59 degrees.

As this burst was not observed by Ulysses due to a high solar
proton-induced background, only minor improvements to this localization
are possible.
