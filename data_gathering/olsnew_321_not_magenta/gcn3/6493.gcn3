W. Landsman (NASA/GSFC), F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and C. Pagani (PSU) 
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team.

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 61 seconds of the field of GRB 
070610 (Pagani et al., GCN 6489) with the White (160-650 nm) filter 
starting 3131 seconds after the BAT trigger.    The UVOT finding chart 
was delayed was due to an Earth limb constraint.

No afterglow candidate has been found within the 8.2" XRT error circle 
(Pagani et al., GCN 6490) to a 3 sigma magnitude upper limit of 19.4.   
No correction has been made for the expected large extinction at a 
Galactic latitude of -1 deg.
