A.Volnova (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP),  I. Korobtsev (ISTP), M. Eselevich 
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140320C (Mereghetti  et al., GCN 16007) 
with AZT-33IK telescope of Mondy observatory starting on Mar. 20 (UT) 
15:12:44. We obtained several images of 120 s exposure in R-filter. 
Within entire INTEGRAL error circle we identified sources which are not 
presented in the DSS2(R) image:

N  RA(J2000)    Dec. (J2000)

1. 08 57 55.04 +71 13 36.5
2. 08 57 16.68 +71 10 10.6
3. 08 57 34.11 +71 11 55.0

(Uncertainty of all coordinates are 1 arcsec.)

However,  our  images are more deep than DSS2(R), down to a limiting 
magnitude R~21, and at present time we cannot determine whether the 
sources are fading.
