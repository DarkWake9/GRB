report:

The 30 cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malargue
(Argentina) reacted robotically to the Swift/BAT alert
of GRB201203A (Dichiara et al., GCNC 28985), starting
with a series of 20 s unfiltered images at 06:54:04 UT,
i.e. 97 s post trigger.

We do not detect any new or strongly variable source at
or around the reported gamma-ray errorbox in single
frames or a combined 20 x 20 s image taken between 1.5
min and 12.5 min after the initial trigger. The
combined exposure has a limiting magnitude r'(AB) ~
17, as calibrated against the Atlas Catalogue.
