report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:35:05.08 UT on 14 July 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200714E (trigger 616444510 / 200714774), which was also
detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, GCN 28103). The Fermi GBM
Final Real-time Localization (GCN 28098) is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 104 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single bright peak
with a duration (T90) of about 20 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.8 s to T0+21.3 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 189 +/- 28 keV,
alpha = -0.92 +/- 0.09, and beta = -2.3 +/- 0.3.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.4 +/- 0.5)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 11.1 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
