TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1806
SUBJECT: GRB 030115, optical observations
DATE:    03/01/15 07:55:20 GMT
FROM:    Peter Garnavich at U of Notre Dame  <pgarnavi@miranda.phys.nd.edu>

We imaged the full error box of the HETE burst GRB 030115
with the 1.2m telescope at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory
starting at 6:35 UT (3 hours and 13 minutes after the burst).
We do not detect the object found by Castro-Tirado et al.
(GCN 1805) and estimate the limiting magnitude of
R=19.8 based on USNO 2.0 catalog magnitudes. A comparison
between our images and the Digitized Sky Survey does not
show any new sources brighter than our magnitude limit within
the HETE error box.
