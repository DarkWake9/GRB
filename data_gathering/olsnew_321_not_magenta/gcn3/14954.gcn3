(Univ. Aarhus), report:

We observed the field of GRB 130701A (Kuin et al., GCN 14953) with the 
NOT equipped with the ALFOSC camera. Observations were carried out in 
the R band and started on 2013 Jul 1.198 UT (28 min after the GRB). We 
detect a new object not visible in the DSS and SDSS surveys, at coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 23:48:55.09
Dec(J2000) = +36:06:01.4

The object had a magnitude R = 17.55 at 04:49 UT, calibrated against 
SDSS stars converted to Johnson R. The source decayed by 0.25 mag by 
04:58 UT, hence confirming it is the afterglow of GRB 130701A.
