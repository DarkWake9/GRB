report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:


We imaged the field of GRB 060607 (Ziaeepour et al. GCN 5233)  the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile. A first set  
of observations was performed automatically in the near infrared (J,  
H, K, z bands) starting on June 5:13:45UT.

A preliminary analysis reveals an uncatalogued source of H ~ 13.3 at  
RA,DEC = (21:58:50.4, -22:29:47).

Further observations are in progress.
