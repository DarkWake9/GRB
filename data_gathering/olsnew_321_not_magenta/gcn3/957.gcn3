report:

"We have obtained about 30 images of a field containing the BSAX/WFC
error box for the 150 s long GRB 010220 (Piro et al. GCN 953, Manzo et al.
GCN 956) with the ultra wide-field CCD of BOOTES-1 during the time interval
Feb 20.93-Feb 20.97 UT (+/- 0.5 h around the GRB occurrence). The exposures,
with integration time of 60 s, cover a field of 40 x 28 deg² and reach a
limiting magnitude of about R = 10. None of the frames, including the one
ending at 22:51:15 UT, i.e. covering the first 8 s of the event, reveals an
optical transient within the BSAX/WFC error circle. The next frame started
at 22:52:15 UT and covers the time interval t_0 + 68 s to t_0 + 128 s.
We notice that the galactic nebula IC 1805 lies along the line of sight of
the GRB, at a galactic latitude of b = +1.38 deg, i.e. the extinction
is high (A_v = 3.3 mag). Images and additional information can be found
at http://www.LAEFF.ESA.Es/~ajct/GRBs/GRB010220/ .
