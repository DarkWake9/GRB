SUBJECT: GRB 140110A: Second Follow-up Swift-XRT Observation

A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA) and P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf 
of the Swift team:

Swift carried out a second follow-up observation to investigate the 
behaviour of the X-ray source #2 reported by Maselli et al. (GCN 15721) 
as a result of the analysis of tiled observations covering the LAT error 
circle. This source, although outside the error box formed by the 
intersection between the LAT error circle and the IPN annulus reported 
by Pal'shin et al.(GCN 15725), suggested initially a possible fading 
behaviour (Maselli et al., GCN 15721).

The new observation started on January 21, 928 ks after the LAT trigger, 
and had an exposure of 6.3 ks. The source #2 has been detected with a 
mean count rate of (1.24 ± 0.16) x 10^-2 ct s^-1 which is consistent 
with the one (1.23 ± 0.27) x 10^-2 ct s^-1 corresponding to eleven days 
earlier. Therefore, we exclude that it may be the afterglow of GRB 140110A.

The Swift-XRT tiled observations have covered the whole error box 
reported by Pal'shin et al. (GCN 15725) and no credible counterpart for 
the X-ray afterglow has been detected (see also Maselli et al., GCN 15747).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
