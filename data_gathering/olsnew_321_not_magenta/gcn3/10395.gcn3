(STScI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the short GRB 100206A (GCN #10376) with GMOS
on the Gemini-North 8-m telescope starting on 2010 Feb 7.215 (15.7
hours after the burst).  Observations were obtained in the i- and
z-band filters for a total of 1200 sec in each filter.  Inside the
refined XRT error circle (GCN #10378) we detect the candidate optical
afterglow detected with the WHT (GCN #10386).  Within the photometric
uncertainties the source does not appear to fade in either filter
between the two observation (7 and 15.7 hours) and it is thus unlikely
to be the optical afterglow.  However, since the source is located
within the XRT error circle we consider it to be a potential host
galaxy, likely at a higher redshift than the bright galaxy at z=0.41
located just outside the error circle (GCN #10389)."
