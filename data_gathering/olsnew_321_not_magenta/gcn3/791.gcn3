TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on
behalf of the NEAR and Konus-Wind GRB teams, and E. Mazets and
S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and Konus observed this burst at 26125 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~500 s, a 25-100
keV fluence of ~5 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over
0.5 s of ~9 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  Because of the unusual
time history, these estimates are subject to revision.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
box whose area is ~30 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  2 h 18 m 41.81 s      7 o 48 '  30.14 "  (CENTER)
  2 h 18 m 42.70 s      7 o 46 '  34.18 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 18 m 17.24 s      7 o 39 '  51.47 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 19 m  6.41 s      7 o 57 '  10.32 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 18 m 40.92 s      7 o 50 '  26.11 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined.
