We observed the localization region of the gravitational wave trigger S200105ae (LVC, GCN #26640) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the 47 square degree Zwicky Transient Facility camera (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019).

The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We started obtaining target-of-opportunity observations in the g-band and r-band beginning at 2020-01-07 01:54 UT. Combining triggered 180s and serendipitous 30s observations, we covered 45.1% of the enclosed probability with a median depth of 19.5 mag (due to poor seeing conditions and proximity to the moon). 

The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). Alert filtering and follow-up coordination was undertaken by the GROWTH Marshal system (Kasliwal et al. 2019). The ZTF alert stream was also queried using the Kowalski infrastructure (Duev et al., 2019) and with AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019).

No candidates of interest have been identified thus far. Additional analysis is in progress.
