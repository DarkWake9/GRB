We observed the field of the short GRB 220412B (Gropp et al. GCN Circ. 31886) with the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope equipped with the 
optical camera DOLORES. A series of images were obtained with the r-sdss filter on 2022-04-13 from 04:42:48 UT to 05:26:37 UT 
(i.e. at a mid time of about 12 hours after the burst).  

No clear afterglow candidate is detected within the BAT error (Gropp et al. GCN Circ. 31886). The typical 3sigma limiting magnitude of 
our co-added image for isolated objects is r ~ 24.2 mag (AB; calibrated against the SDSS catalogue).
