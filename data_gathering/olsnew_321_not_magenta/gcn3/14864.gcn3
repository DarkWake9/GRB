report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  the Swift GRB 130606A (Ukwatta  et al., GCN 
14781) with  AZT-11 telescope of CrAO observatory  starting on  June 06
(UT) 21:59:60. We took  several images in R-filter of 180 s exposure. The 
afterglow (Jelinek et al., GCN 14782; Xu et al.,  GCN 14783; Nagayama et 
al., GCN 14784)   is not detected in a combined image.   A photometry  is 
based  on the same SDSS stars we used  in GCN 14806:
