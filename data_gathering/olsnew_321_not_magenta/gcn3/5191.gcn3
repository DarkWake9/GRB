N. Kodaka, Y. Urata, M. Tashiro, K. Abe, K. Onda, K. Masuno (Saitama-U),
F. Usui (ISAS/JAXA), M. Kuwahara (TUS/RIKEN), T. Tamagawa (RIKEN) report: 

"We observed the error region of GRB 051227 (Barbier et al. GCN 4397)
with the very wide-field camera WIDGET located at Akeno, Japan. WIDGET
monitored the region continuously with repeat of unfiltered 5-second
exposures between 187 minutes before and 12 minutes after the burst
trigger. We did not find any optical emission at the Swift XRT source
position (Beardmore et al. GCN 4402). The 1-sigma limiting magnitude
of each frame derived by the Tycho-2 catalog was around V=10.9
magnitudes."
