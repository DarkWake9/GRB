Paul Price, Tim Axelrod and Brian Schmidt report:

We have observed the error circle of GRB000529 (BeppoSAX mail 00/13) with the
50-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory.  Exposure was 3 x 300s, starting
at May 30.74 UT, with a limiting magnitude of R_M ~ 19.75 (where R_M refers to
the MACHO red band).  We find no OT candidate on comparison with the DSS.
