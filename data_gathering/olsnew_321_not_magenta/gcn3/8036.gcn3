report:

The field  of GRB 080727C (GCN 8035, SWIFT trigger=318170) was observed 
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m  telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK
National Observatory, Turkey), starting at  28 July, 00:58 UT,
i.e. ~2 hours after the burst, using Andor CCD.

We made 2*900 sec exposures in the R band and 900 sec exposure in the I 
band. We found no new source within XRT error circle. Using USNO-B1 stars 
we estimated frame limits as R~23.0 mag, I~21.5 mag.
