MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru)
responded to GRB060926 (Holland  et al., GCN Circ 5612) under the good 
conditions (V. Lipunov et al., GCN Circ 5632).

The first image was started at 2006-09-26 16:49:57 UT, 76 s  after the GRB
time (355 mm telescope, 6 square degrees FOV, 2.1'' per pix, CCD Alta U16).
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
We find (Lipunov et al., GCN5632) faint OT on the first and on  the 
coadded images at position:

aplha = 17 35 43.66
dec   = 13 02 18.3
err = +- 0.7''

wich coincided with the Holland  et al.(GCN Circ 5612) OT position.

  We have refind analysis of the images. We discovery optical
flare around 500-700 s after the GRB time (see picture):

The light curve is available at

Between 91s and 255s a power-law decline with a temporal index 
of -1.40+/-0.24 is estimated. Between 707s and 1200s a power-law decline 
with a temporal index of -3.30+/-0.70 is estimated. After 1000 s  a 
power-law decline with a temporal index 0.73 +-0.1 was observed
(A. Stefanescu et al., GCN 5623).

We remember that X-ray flare in GRB 060926  was descovered
by XRT team (M. Perri et al., GCN 5622).

The X-ray spectrum covering the time period from T+67s to T+878s is well
fit by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 2.1(+/-0.3) and column
density of (2.2+/-0.9)e21 cm**-2 (M. Perri et al., GCN 5622). They note 
the Galactic column density in the direction of the source is 7.3e20 
cm**-2 .
This means that absorbtion  is about 1 magnitude in our band.
The optical-xray data is well fit by power-low with a photon index of 
1.7+-0.2 during all our time observation.
