team report:

The long GRB 130102B localized by MAXI/GSC (Higa et al., GCN 14130) was 
detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a total duration of ~30 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of (3.46 +/-
0.28)x10^-6 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1400 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(MAXI)-21 s 
to T0(MAXI)+11 s) by a simple power-law model yields a power law index 
of 2.85 +/- 0.17.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
