As part of the Kilonova and Transients Program (KNTraP, NOIRLab Proposal ID
2022A-679480, PI: Zhang) observing run, we conducted follow-up observations
of ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc (I. Andreoni et al. GCNC #31590) with the Dark
Energy Camera (DECam) on the CTIO 4m Victor Blanco Telescope between
February 15 and 22,
approximately 3-10 days after the initial ZTF detection.  We took nightly
observations each with a combination of g, r, i and z
band exposures.  We present preliminary photometry (calibrated with the
Pan-STARRS photometric catalogs using Gaia star selection) from these
exposures.

We would also like to acknowledge the CTIO staff, especially Kathy Vivas,
Jacqueline Seron, Alberto Alvarez and Claudio Aguilera, who kept our
observations running smoothly.
