Some of you recently received a GCN Notice for a
Swift-BAT Lightcuve trigger 353567.  This notice
was due to a bug in the GCN processing of the
Swift telelmetry stream.  Due to a combination of
(a) a BAT subthreshold trigger, (b) a gap in the TDRSS
telemetry stream, (c) a possible (uncomfirmed yet)
corruption in the telelmetry stream, and (d) a delay
in the telemetry stream due to a Swift-Malindi
telemetry downlink,  an old BAT lightcurve packet
was converted to a Notice and distributed.
Again, this LC Notice (trig=353567) should be ignored.
My apologies for the confusion.
