D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), 
C.E. Martinez-Vazquez (IAC-ULL), S. Murabito (IAC-ULL) report on behalf 
of a larger collaboration:

We observed again the field of GRB 160119A (Marshall et al., GCN 18893) 
with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC camera. 
Observations start on January 20.14 UT (1.01 days after the GRB) and 
consisted of 3x600 s in the SDSS r band.

No object is detected at the position of the candidate afterglow 
(Malesani et al., GCN 18895; Cucchiara et al., GCN 18901; Chen et al., 
GCN 18902), down to a limiting magnitude r > 23.8 AB (3 sigma), 
calibrated against nearby SDSS stars.

Compared to our previous observation (Malesani et al., GCN 18895), the 
new measurement conclusively establishes fading, thus confirming that 
this source is the afterglow of GRB 160119A, as already suggested by 
Chen et al. (GCN 18902).
