We observed the field of GRB 090628 (Mangano et al., GCN #9585) in Rc
band (14 x 60 seconds) with the Zeiss-1000 telescope of SAO RAS
(Russia). The observations were carried out at high air mass. We did
not detect any object within the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al.,
GCN #9590) down to the limiting magnitude 19.3 (according to nearby
USNO-B1 stars). The average time of observations is 22:23:16 UT,
1.05 hours after the trigger.
