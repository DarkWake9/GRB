We observed the field of GRB 160131A (Page, et al., GCN 18951) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/02 4.10 to 2016/02 4.36 UTC (89.96 to
96.25 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.60 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne, et al., GCN
18958), in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the
following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r = 21.64 +/- 0.05
  i = 21.41 +/- 0.03
  z > 20.48

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  We note that there is a faint,
possible source present in the DSS near this source which could be the GRB
host galaxy.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
