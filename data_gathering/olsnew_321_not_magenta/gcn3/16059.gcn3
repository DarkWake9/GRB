report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140323A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 592916) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 1.0 hour after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field was at 27 degrees above
horizon and weather conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures. We do not
detect any optical candidate in the XRT error box
provided by Troja et al. (GCNC 16027) at the
limiting magnitude of:

 From t0+1.0h to t0+1.6h Rlim=20.8

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=306.3802 lat=-36.7801
