The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160417A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 19316) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Apr 17.58, Apr 18.81, Apr 
20.66, Apr 24.68, and Apr 28.77 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Osborne et al., GCN 19318), with 3sigma upper limits 
of 225 uJy, 105 uJy, 123 uJy, 72 uJy, and 96 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
