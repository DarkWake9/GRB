The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S191109d during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and
LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2019-11-09 01:07:17.221 UTC (GPS
time: 1257296855.221). The candidate was found by the SPIIR [1], CWB
[2], GstLAL [3], MBTAOnline [4], and PyCBC Live [5] analysis
pipelines.

S191109d is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 1.5e-13 Hz, or about one in 2e5
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:
https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S191109d

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), NSBH (<1%),
or MassGap (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability
that the lighter compact object has a mass < 3 solar masses (HasNS) is
<1%. Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the
probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is
<1%.

One sky map is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * “bayestar.fits.gz,0”, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 9 minutes after the candidate
event time.

For the bayestar.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 1487
deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity
distance estimate is 1810 +/- 604 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).
