S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the location of the Swift GRB130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 14204)
with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Images were obtained in the
SDSS r', i', and z' filters beginning at 02:29 UT on 2013 Feb 15 (~ 1 hr
after the Swift trigger).

We detect a bright point source at the location of the optical counterpart
(Zheng et al., GCN 14205) in all filters.  Using several nearby point
sources from the USNO-B1 for reference, we measure a magnitude of R = 15.9
at this time.

Observations are ongoing.
