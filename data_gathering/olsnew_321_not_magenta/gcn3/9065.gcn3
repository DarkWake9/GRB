There are 6 MASTER Very Wide Field cameras located at Kislovodsk and 
Irkutsk  with common FOW = 6000 square degrees 
(http://observ.pereplet.ru/).

One of the two  MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Irkutsk
(D=50 mm, 2x1000 square degrees, 11 Mpx) has observed  ~20% 1-sigma Fermi
error box  (A. Goldstein, GCN 9056) with 1s exposure
during  all night: befoure, during and after GRB Time
without time gap between images.

Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitude limit of the each emage is  ~9.1 m at the edge of FOW (some 
ising was attend at this night).

We do not detect OT inside 20% part of the error box.


We  conclude (in the case that GRB inside our FOW ):

1). the optical fluence during the short 0.3 s GRBurst is limited by

                        ~<=  3 x 10E-9 erg/cm_2

excluding possible  host galaxy absorbtion.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.61 +/- 0.31)E-07 erg/cm^2 (A. Goldstein, GCN 9056).

So:

2).  Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8-1000 keV) ~ < 1/300

The same ratio for long GRB080319B is

Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8 - 1000 keV) ~ 1/140

(Naked Eye GRB, Racusin, Karpov et al., Nature, vol.455, 183, 2008).

Black circles are the 1-sigma and 3-sigma 
error boxes (A. Goldstein, GCN 9056).


The reduction is continued.
