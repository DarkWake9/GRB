J. C. Tello, S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC), Martin Jelinek (Astronomical Institute
ASU-AVCR Ondrejov) and A. J.Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC & ISA-UMA), on behalf
of a larger collaboration, report:

"The 60 cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope (Malaga, Spain) automatically
responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 160119A (Marshall et al., GCN 18893).
The first unfiltered images where obtained at 03:07:59 (111 seconds after
the burst, 9.44 seconds after receiving the GCN alert).

No credible source is found when combining the first 40 unfiltered images
of 3 seconds exposure. The combined image ranges from 03:07:59 UT -
03:10:28 UT (1.85-4.33 minutes after the burst) and results in a limiting
magnitude of 19.5 when compared to SDSS-R6 r filter catalog.

We also observed the field using the i filter, no credible source is found
either when combining 6x60s exposures. The combined image ranges from
03:16:54 UT - 03:40:01 UT (10.7-33.9 minutes after the burst) and results
in a limiting magnitude of 18.5 when compared to SDDS-R6 catalog."
