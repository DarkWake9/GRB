B.-B. Zhang (PSU) and D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.1 ks of XRT data for GRB 130515A (Malesani  et al.
GCN Circ. 14650),  from 82 s to 34.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT
position for this burst was given by Beardmore et al. (GCN. Circ
14654). The source is fading with alpha >0.8.


If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of 0.8,
the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.4 x 10^-4 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00555880.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
