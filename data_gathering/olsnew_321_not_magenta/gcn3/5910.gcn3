Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward GRB
061210 (GCN 5904) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2006 December 12 at
9.81 UT.  The peak radio brightness at the BAT ground-calculated position
(GCN 5905) is 26 uJy ± 34 uJy.  The nearest source in the GRB field of view
is at a distance of 3.54 arcmin, cataloged in NVSS and FIRST survey as
J093751+153629.
