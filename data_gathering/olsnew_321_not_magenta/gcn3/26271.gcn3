Our observation starts at  13:48:57 UT and ends at 13:54:24 UT Nov 22, 2019, with five exposure 60 seconds in white filter.
We do not detect any candidate sources in the combined image in the enhanced XRT position error region to a 5 sigma limit at 18.31 generated from G band magnitude in Gaia DR2 .
