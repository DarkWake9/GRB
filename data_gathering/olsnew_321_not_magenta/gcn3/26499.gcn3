We obtained NIR observations of the faint transient AT2019wxt (PS19hgw; McBrien et al., GCN Circ. 26485), 
possibly associated with the gravitational wave event S191213g (LVC, GCN Circ. 26402), with the 3.58m TNG 
telescope equipped with NICS in imaging mode. A series of images were obtained with the J filter on 2019-12-18 
from 19:16:04 to 19:59:02 UT (i.e. about 5.6 days after the GW event). 

The transient is clearly detected with a magnitude J(AB) = 19.6 +/- 0.1 (obtained from preliminary psf photometry 
calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue and subtracting the host galaxy contribution).
