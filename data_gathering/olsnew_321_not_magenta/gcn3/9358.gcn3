SUBJECT: GRB 090515: KAIT optical upper limits

W. Li, R. Chornock, and A. V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory responded to
the Swift trigger of GRB 090515 (Beardmore et al., GCN 9356) and began a
sequence of filtered and unfiltered 20s images followed by a set of three 180s
unfiltered images.  We detect no new source within the XRT error circle
(Beardmore et al., GCN 9356).  Individual unfiltered 20s exposures starting at
04:59:09 UT have 3-sigma limiting magnitudes (calibrated to USNO B1) of about
mag 19.1.  Our combined set of 3x180s unfiltered images has an upper limit of
about mag 20.5 at a midpoint of 05:19:47 UT.
