P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino, G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OABr & Univ. Insubria) and 
L. Stella (INAF-OAR) report on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:


We performed a small set of short exposures with the VLT equipped with 
the ISAAC camera on the field of the short GRB061217 (Barthelmy et al., 
GCN 5926). Our observations started on Dec 18.262 UT (about 1.1 d after 
the burst). While we clearly detect the four point-like objects reported 
by Cobb et al. (GCN 5935), we do not detect any candidate for the host 
galaxy of GRB061217 inside or near the XRT error-box (Evans et al. GCN 
5932) up to a limiting magnitude of H > 20.3 (3sigma level).

This message can be cited.

[GCN OPS NOTE(21dec06): The typo in the next to last line "GRB061218"
was changed to "GRB061217".]
