S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), M.Turler,
V.Beckmann, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A short hard GRB consisting of a single peak with duration of  about 0.7 s 
has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:13:11 UT on December 26th. 

The refined coordinates (J2000)  are:

RA = 25.495 [degrees]
DEC= -47.439 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of  
about 3 ph/cmq/s (0.2 s integration time) and a fluence over the same energy
range of about 10e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
