SUBJECT: GRB060507: Swift XRT position

L. Vetere, M.L. Conciatore, M. Perri (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) and
L. M. Barbier (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 060707 (trigger #208870, Barbier et
al., GCN 5084) at 02:39:33 UT, 46 minutes after the BAT trigger.
Analysis of the initial TDRSS downliked data reveals a faint and
uncataloged
source at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 05h 59m 51.9s
Dec(J2000) = +75d 14' 56"

with an estimated uncertainty of 7.5 arcseconds (90% containment).
This position lies 43 arcseconds from the center of the BAT error circle
reported in GCN 5084.

Due to the small number of counts, we are unable to determine whether
the source is decaying at this time. Observations are continuing and
further analysis regarding the fading nature of this source will be
issued as the data becomes available.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
