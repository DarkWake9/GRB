GRB 141207A: Swift-UVOT Observations

M. H. Siegel (PSU) and A. Amaral-Rogers (U. Leicester) report 
on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

We have observed the area around the Fermi-LAT GRB 141207A (Arimoto et
al., GCN Circ. 17146), in 4 UVOT fields starting at 07:59:28 UT, 12
hours and 48 minutes after Fermi/LAT detection. There is an optical source
at a position of RA,Dec=160.06441, 3.89477, which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000)  = 10h 40m 15.46s
Dec (J2000) = +03d 53' 41.2”

with an uncertainty of 0.1” (radius, 90% confidence).  This source is
5.6” from the position of the XRT source (Amaral-Rogers and Evans, GCN
Circ. 17149) and shows up as a marginal detection in the DSS. It is possibly
unrelated to the burst.  Follow-up observations will be needed to confirm its nature.

The preliminary u magnitude using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) is 19.91+-0.17.
