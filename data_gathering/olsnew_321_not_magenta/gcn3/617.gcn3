H. Pedersen, B. L. Jensen (University of Copenhagen),
J. Gorosabel (Danish Space Research Institute, Copenhagen),
J. P. U. Fynbo (Aarhus University) report on behalf of 
a wider, European group: 

We have observed the entire error box of GRB 000307  
(cf. Hurley et al., GCN #601), using the WFI instrument 
attached to the 2.2-m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla.

The exposure dates were:

2000 March 10.015 UT, 2 * 600 s R-band, seeing 0.9" - 1.2" 
2000 March 23.019 UT, 3 * 600 s R-band, seeing 1.1" - 1.6"

The two exposure sets were compared, using image blinking.
The closeness of Betelgeuse implies scattered light across 
the error box, and hence a non-uniform limiting magnitude. 
Using the standard stars provided by Henden et al. (GCN #608) 
we estimate that most of the error box has been searched to 
magnitude R ~22.0.     

No candidate counterpart was found. 

We acknowledge the assistance of the La Silla staff.

Observations were carried out at the European Southern 
Observatory under programme 64.H-0573(A).
