D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this GRB at
32487 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 15 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
8.8E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 333.705, -38.663 degrees, whose radius is 69.139 +/-  0.118
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
