SUBJECT: GRB 191017A: Fermi GBM Final Localization
DATE:    19/10/17 14:22:00 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger (trigger 592997024 /
191017391)
at 09:23:39.27 UT on 17 October, 2019, was misclassified by the GBM flight
software as a particle event but is in fact due to a GRB.

Therefore, the Fermi GBM team reports the detection of GRB 191017A. The
on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is
RA = 171.25, Dec = +38.05 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 25m, 38d
03'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5 degrees. The angle from the Fermi LAT
boresight is 131.44 degrees.
