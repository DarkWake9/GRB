G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) reports:

On May 09.06569 2014 UT (22.5 hours after the burst), we imaged the field around 
GRB 140508A  (Singer et al. GCN 16226) remotely using the the 0.43m-f/6.8 
robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope robotic facility in Italy.

The source is visible on 300 seconds unfiltered CCD images at the following 
coordinates (J2000.0):

R.A. = 17 01 51.94
Decl. +46 46 49.2

We also performed photometry, assuming R-mags from UCAC-4 for the stars in the
field, getting an estimate for the magnitude of 19.3CR).
