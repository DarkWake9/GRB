Still, and N. Gehrels (GSFC),  report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050318 at 15:44:37 UT on 18 March
2005 (Krimm et al 2005, GCN 3111).  The BAT position was within the Swift 
Earth horizon constraint.  The observatory executed an automated slew to 
the BAT position and the XRT began taking data in Auto State  at 16:39:14 
UT.  Swift did not have contact with the ground station until about 22:29 
UT.  On receiving the data at Penn State, a preliminary analysis was 
performed by the XRT team.  We find a bright uncataloged, rapidly fading 
X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 03:18:50.8,
Dec(J2000) = -46:23:45.1.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds.   This source is 87
arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3111.
