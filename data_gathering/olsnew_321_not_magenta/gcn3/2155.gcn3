K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 04327
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
50 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.3E-05 erg/cm2, and
a peak flux of approximately  3.8E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 334.193, -39.067 degrees, whose radius is 84.171 +/-  0.014
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
