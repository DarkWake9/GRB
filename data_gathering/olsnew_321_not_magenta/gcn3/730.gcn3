K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 59762 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~5 s, a 25-100 keV
fluence of ~5x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of
~6x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have localized it to an ~130 sq.
arcmin. error box whose preliminary, 3 sigma coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 11 h 15 m 41.48 s     10 o 42 '   2.50 "  (CENTER)
 11 h 15 m 56.55 s     10 o 41 '  53.52 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 14 m 17.45 s     11 o  0 '  30.38 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 17 m  4.21 s     10 o 23 '  34.43 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 15 m 26.41 s     10 o 42 '  11.33 "  (CORNER)

This localization can be improved.
