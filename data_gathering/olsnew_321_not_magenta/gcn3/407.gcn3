K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

We have obtained a preliminary IPN annulus for GRB990907 (GCN 405).  This
annulus is centered at RA=156.6738 deg., Decl.=-13.6899 deg. (J2000),
and has a radius of 62.1237 +/-  0.080 deg. (3 sigma).  It intersects the
BeppoSAX NFI error circle (GCN 373) to form an ~100 arcmin.^2 error
box whose corners are:

RA(2000)	Decl.(2000)
07h 30m 37.7s	-69o 30' 18"
07h 29m 39.6s	-69o 24' 14"
07h 31m 55.0s	-69o 23' 22"
07h 31m 09.7s	-69o 18' 41"

A map may be found at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990907/.  Only minor
refinements to this annulus are expected.
