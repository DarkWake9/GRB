The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1) and Virgo Observatory (V1) data around the time of the compact
binary merger (CBC) candidate S200302c (GCN Circular 27278). Parameter
estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky
map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN Notice, is available
for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200302c

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 5656 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 1820 +/- 536 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
