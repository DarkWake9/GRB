   We re-analyzed the I-band images taken with the 1.8m telescope
  of the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, Korea.
  The I-band observation started at 76.1 min after the burst (Holland
  et al. #7362), and continued for 2100 secs.
  Our reanalysis of the stacked image show the detection of a possible
  optial transient within the error circle of the XRT position (Goad et al.
  #7366), and the reported Gemini-N i-band position (Tanvir et al.7369).
  The brightness of the OT, calibrated against USNO-B1 star at
  (09:06:31.6,+35:08,06.4), is I ~ 21.9 +- 0.3 mag with the error arising
  mostly from the uncertainty associated with the subtraction of
  the fringe pattern.
  Further deeper imaging is encouraged.

  We thank J. Seo and Yeon-Bom Jeon for their assistance with
  the BOAO observation.
