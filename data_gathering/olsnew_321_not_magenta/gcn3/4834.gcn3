NUMBER:  4834
SUBJECT: GRB 060218/SN 2006aj: ABT observations
DATE:    06/02/25 17:40:22 GMT

K. Wiersema (University of Amsterdam) and F. Nieuwenhout report on
behalf of the AWSV "Metius" ABT collaboration:

"We observed GRB060218/SN 2006aj (Cusumano et al., GCN 4775)
with the amateur 0.25m ABT telescope, from Alkmaar, The Netherlands,
under moderate observing conditions.
Starting from Feb 24 17:58 UT, a series of 1 minute exposures in
V band were acquired, ending at 18:38 UT. 28 exposures were combined.
The object is detected and we measure V = 17.37 +/- 0.21, using
SDSS g' and r' data from Cool et al. (GCN 4777) and the transformation
equations by Smith et al. (2002).

We like to point out the suitability of this supernova for intensive
amateur follow-up.

The ABT telescope is an internet-controlled 0.25m telescope
located in Alkmaar, The Netherlands, built and operated by members of
local amateur astronomy club "Metius".
This detection of GRB060218/SN 2006aj is the first reported
detection of an optical GRB afterglow/SN from Dutch soil.

We acknowledge the assistance of E. Rol and R. Wijers in making the
ABT GRB follow-up program possible."
