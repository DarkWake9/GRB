Skynet observed the Swift BAT/XRT localization of GRB 150314A (Hagen et al., GCN 17573, Swift trigger=634795) with the 41" telescope at Yerkes Observatory in WI, USA, starting at 2015-03-14 04:58:22 (t=3.5m post-trigger) and continuing until t=41m post-trigger. Skynet took a total of 17 exposures ranging from 20s to 160s in the g', r' and i' bands. We detect a fading source in all three bands at the position reported by Zheng & Filippenko (GCN 17574).

A preliminary light curve is at:

Magnitudes are in the AB System, calibrated to 4 APASS stars in the field.  Magnitudes have not been corrected for line-of-sight Milky Way dust extinction, with expected E(B-V)=0.035 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

No further Skynet observations are scheduled.
