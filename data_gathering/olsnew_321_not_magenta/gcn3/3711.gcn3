C. Jacques and E. Pimentel, CEAMIG-REA Observatory
(Brazil) report on behalf of the AAVSO International
High Energy Network:

We observed the afterglow candiate proposed (Holland et al.,
GCN 3704; Sota et al., GCN 3705, Gomboc et al., GCN 3706)
for the Swift GRB 050730 (Holland et al., GCN 3704).

It is detectable in our 6x60 second summed unfiltered
CCD image using a 30cm SCT and ST7XME camera with an
R-band equivalent magnitude of 18.4 using USNO-A2 calibration.
The mid-exposure time was 2005-07-30 at 23:38 UT.

Astrometry using 32 UCAC2 reference stars, with residuals
of 0.08" in RA and 0.07" in Dec, is
14:08:17.13  -03:46:16.7  J2000

A FITS image will be available later on our web site.

The AAVSO thanks the Curry Foundataion for their continued
support of the AVSO International High Energy Network.
