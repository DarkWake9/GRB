The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:53:12 UT on 29 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200929A (trigger 623047997.2666 / 200929204).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 217.4, Dec = -34.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 29m, -34d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 47.0 degrees.
