Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140614B (trigger #601662)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 16394).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 322.636, 14.895 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 30m 32.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 53' 41.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 71%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED pulse starting at ~T0,
peaking at ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+75 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
49.8 +- 7.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.28 to T+55.59 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.04 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.5 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.93 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
