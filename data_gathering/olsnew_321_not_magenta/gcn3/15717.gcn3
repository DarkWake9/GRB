J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

There were some small gaps in the data used in the BAT refined analysis
of GRB 140108A (Cummings et. al, GCN circ # 15710).  With a complete
data set, T90 is slightly shorter, 94 +- 4 seconds, the photon index for
the simple power-law fit to the spectrum is slightly larger, 1.62 +- 0.05,
and the total fluence is slightly larger, (7.0 +- 0.2) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.
The energy interval is 15-150 keV and uncertainties are 90% confidence.

In the lightcurve, the second peak is a little larger than it looked
before, and is very similar to the first peak.
