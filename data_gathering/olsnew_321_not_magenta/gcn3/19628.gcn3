Kilian Toelge (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:19:38.28 UT on 26 June 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160629A (trigger 488931582 / 160629930),
which was also detected by the INTEGRAL/IBAS
(Gotz et al. 2016, GCN 19621)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.

The GBM light curve consists of a long main peak and a short second peak 
after
around 65 seconds.
The duration (T90) is about 66.6 +/- 0.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.1 s to T0+70.7 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.05 +/- 0.03 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 295.50 +/- 19.30 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.9 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+14.1 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 5.6 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
