The long, bright GRB 180526A (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #8067,
Konus-Wind trigger time on 11:03:36.006, AstroSat CZTI detection:
Sharma et al., GCN circ. 22742) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:03:36.200 UTC on 26 May 2018.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this
trigger because the real-time communication from the ISS was off
(loss of signal). The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T-2.2 sec, peaks at T+44.4 sec and ends at T+79.2 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
56.9 +- 2.8 sec and 16.3 +- 1.3 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
