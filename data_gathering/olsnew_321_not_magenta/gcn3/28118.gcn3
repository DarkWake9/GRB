Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 200716B, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #28113) and BALROG (Biltzinge B. et al., GCN #28114).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-07-16 07:34:29.531 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 356 +/- 27 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 3023 +/- 68 cts. The local mean background count rate was 572 +/- 1 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 29.35 +/- 0.08 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-07-16 07:34:28.000 UT. The measured peak count rate is 1190 +/- 53 cts/s above the background in the combined Veto data of four quadrants, with a total of 8920 +/- 167 cts. The local mean background count rate was 1623 +/- 3 cts/s.  We measure a T90 of 28.17 +/- 0.31 s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
