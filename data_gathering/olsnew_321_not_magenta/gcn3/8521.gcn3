A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 05:31:32.90 UT on 13 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 081113 (trigger 248247093 / 081113230). 
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 146.7, DEC = +68.9 (J2000 degrees,  
equivalent to 09h 47m, 68d 54'), with an uncertainty    
of 9.1 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

This GRB with an estimated T90 (8-1000 keV) of 0.5 s
consists of two short peaks (of ~250 ms and ~150 ms sec 
duration, resp.). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.080 s 
to T0+0.432 s is well fit by a simple power law function 
with index -1.28 +/- 0.05 (chi squared 246 for 241 d.o.f.).
The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(1.07 +/- 0.03)E-06 erg/cm^2. The photon flux on the 
64 ms timescale measured starting from T0-0.016 s 
in the 8-1000 keV band is 20 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2. 

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
