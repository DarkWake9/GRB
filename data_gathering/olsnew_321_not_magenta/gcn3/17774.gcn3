Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink, 
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150428A (trigger #639275) 
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 17765).  The BAT ground-calculated position is 
RA, Dec = 188.539, 6.967 deg which is 
  RA(J2000) =   12h 34m 09.3s 
  Dec(J2000) = +06d 58' 00.8‚Äù 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). 
The partial coding was 16%. 

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts at 
~ T-40 sec and ends at ~ T+60 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 53.2 +- 15.1 sec 
(estimated error including systematics). 

The time-averaged spectrum from T-39.0 to T+38.6 sec is best fit by a simple 
power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.28 +- 0.09. 
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak 
photon flux measured from T+17.4 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
