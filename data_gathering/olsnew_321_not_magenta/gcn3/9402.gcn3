Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Kugel, F. (Obs. Chanteperdrix) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 090519 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 352648) with the FARO robotic telescope (D=20cm)
located at the Chante Perdrix Observatory, Banon, France.
FARO stands for Francois & Alain Robotic Observatory:
http://chanteperdrix.dyndns.org

The observations started 122.4s after the GRB trigger
(53.0s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased
from 22 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2009-05-19T21:08:56.5

The first image is 60.0s exposure in tracking mode.
We do not detect any OT at the XRT position mentionned
by Perri et al. 2009 (GCNC 9400) with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+122.4s to t0+182.4s : R > 15.7

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
