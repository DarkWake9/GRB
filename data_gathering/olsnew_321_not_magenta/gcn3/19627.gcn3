A. Melandri, D. Fugazza, P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of GRB 160630A (Krimm et al., GCN 19624) with the 60-cm robotic telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 04:05:13 UT, ~65 seconds after the burst, and were carried out simultaneously in the g, r, i, z and H bands.

A preliminary photometry indicates that the optical afterglow (Kann et al., GCN 16625) is detected with a magnitude H = 14.9 +/- 0.2, about 100 sec after the burst.

Further analysis is in progress.
