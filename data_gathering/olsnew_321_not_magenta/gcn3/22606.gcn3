report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers

544628550/180405571 at 13:42:25.886 UT on 5 April 2018
544542853/180404579 at 13:54:08.080 UT on 4 April 2018
544531428/180404447 at 10:43:43.753 UT on 4 April 2018

tentatively classified as GRBs, are in fact not due to GRBs.
These triggers are caused by an occultation step due to
MAXI J1820+070 (von Kienlin, GCN Circ. 22595).

Additional triggers are likely expected from this source in the next
days which, however, will not be reported in future circulars."
