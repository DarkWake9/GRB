P. D'Avanzo, D. Fugazza, S. Covino (INAF/OAB) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the short GRB 170827A (Marshall et al., GCN 21718) with the 60-cm robotic 
telescope REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 05:14:24 UT, 
116 seconds after the burst, and were carried out simultaneously in the g, r, i, z and H bands.

A preliminary photometry of the first co-added images indicates that no obvious afterglow candidate 
is detected within the Swift/XRT error circle (Marshall et al., GCN 21718) down to the following 3sigma 
limiting AB magnitudes:

r > 19.5 at T-T0 = 720s
H > 17.5 at T-T0 = 585s


Magnitudes are in the AB system and have been calibrated with respect to the 2MASS (H-band) 
and APASS (r-band) catalogues.
