Using the data set from T-110 to T+303 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070103 (trigger #254532)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 5988).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 352.582, 26.823 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 30m 19.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 26d 49' 22.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 84%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve has three main peaks at T+0, 10 and 18 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 19 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+21.6 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.0 +- 0.2.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.4 +- 0.5 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.11 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are
at the 90% confidence level.
