Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160313A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 678929) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 122s after the GRB trigger
(20s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
64 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good but images are slightly defocused.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT in the XRT error box published
by Goad et al. (GCNC 19174). Next images are recorded
with diurnal tracking.
