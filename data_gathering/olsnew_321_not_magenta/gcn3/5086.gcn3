TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5086
SUBJECT: GRB 060507: MDM Optical Upper Limit
DATE:    06/05/07 03:45:58 GMT
FROM:    Jules Halpern at Columbia U.  <jules@astro.columbia.edu>

J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) and N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) report
on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We took a single 60 s R-band exposure of the Swift BAT location of 
GRB 060507 (Barbier et al., GCN 5084) with the MDM 1.3m telescope
on May 7 02:57 UT, 64 minutes after the trigger.  We see no new object
within the 3' error circle, or at the XRT candidate position of
Vetere et al. (GCN 5085), to a limit of approximately R=19.2.
Evening twilight and telescope pointing constraints prevent any
further observations.

This message may be cited."
