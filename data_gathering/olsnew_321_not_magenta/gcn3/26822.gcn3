Tomas Ahumada (UMD), Leo Singer (NASA GSFC) report on behalf of the ZTF and
GROWTH collaborations

On UT 2020-01-19, we imaged ZTF20aafqvyc/AT2020yq (Anand et al. GCN 26767)
found in the localization region of LIGO/Virgo S200115j (GCN 26759, GCN
26807) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS-N)
mounted on the Gemini-North 8-meter telescope on Mauna Kea.

We combined four g- band 200s exposures using  DRAGONS, a Python-base data
reduction platform provided by the Gemini Observatory. No source is
detected at the source location down to a 3 sigma limits of g = 24.5 AB
mag.
