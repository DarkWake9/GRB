of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140215A
(Swift-BAT trigger 586680: Markwardt et al., GCN 15837;
Barthelmy et al., GCN 15847)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=14831.638 s UT (04:07:11.638).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked with a total duration of ~15 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140215_T14831/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (1.84 ± 0.15)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+4.800 s,
of (3.57 ± 0.35)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+15.360 s)
is best fit in the 28 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.66 ± 0.11,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.94 ± 0.35,
the peak energy Ep = 214 ± 14 keV,
chi2 = 106/95 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+7.168 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.46 ± 0.12,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.83 ± 0.26,
the peak energy Ep = 212 ± 14 keV,
chi2 = 92.9/96 dof.

All the quoted values are preliminary.
