B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), L. Hagen (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team

Swift performed a follow up observation of GRB 150418A, with a pointing  in the direction of Source #1 reported by Sbarufatti et al. (GCN Circ. 17722).
In 3.7 ks of exposure we donâ€™t detect any X-ray source down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 9.8 E-3 counts/s in the position of Source 1.
We note that this new observation and the original one are both affected by a higher than usual background, which may have led to spurious detections of background fluctuations as Sources #1 and #2.

No further Swift observations of this field are planned.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
