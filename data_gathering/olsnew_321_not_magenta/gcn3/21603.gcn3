report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaboration

We observed SSS17a (GCN 21529) with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope in
India at 610 MHz on UT 2017-08-18 11:00. We do not detect any emission at
this location. Multi-band multi-epoch follow-up is underway. We thank the
GMRT staff for rapidly scheduling these observations. The GMRT is run by
the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research.
