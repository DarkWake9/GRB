G. Masi, F. Mallia and U. Tagliaferri (Campo Catino Astronomical
Observatory, Italy) report:

On Aug. 14.069 2002 UT, we imaged the field around the position provided
by Pozanenko et al. (GCN 1479) with the 0.8m-f/8 + CCD from Campo Catino
Astronomical Observatory. The R-images, covering a field of about 5.5' x
5.5', do show nothing obvious down to R = 19.0 (based on USNO A2.0).
