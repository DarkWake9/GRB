The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:54:23 UT on 13 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210813A (trigger 650508868.674406 / 210813038).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 15.0, Dec = 8.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 00m, 8d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
