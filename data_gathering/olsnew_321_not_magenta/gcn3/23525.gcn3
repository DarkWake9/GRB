P. A. Evans (U Leicester), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J.D. Gropp (PSU),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 12:57:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 181213A (trigger=876016).  Swift will slew at ~T+33 min
due to an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 248.207, +78.504, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 32m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +78d 30' 16"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks
with a total duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~850 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+33.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
