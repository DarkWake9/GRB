Swift has performed follow up of LVC trigger G194575 (Singer et al., GCN
Circ. 18442). Unfortunately, most of the error region is in Sun
constraint and cannot be observed. We have observed the locations
(observation centres) listed below. No X-ray sources have been found,
nor have any new sources been seen in UVOT. The typical limiting
magnitude is about 18.9 in the u band. In the XRT the 3-sigma upper
limit is in the range 0.007 to 0.015 ct/s, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV
flux of 3e-13 to 6e-13 erg/cm^2/s.

RA=188.117, Dec=-70.759, exposure=925 s
RA=187.167, Dec=-70.759, exposure=349 s
RA=81.8355, Dec=-4.69639, exposure=880 s
RA=9.77883, Dec=26.2998, exposure=988 s
RA=0.64059, Dec=-60.74, exposure= 993 s
