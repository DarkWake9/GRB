follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 140114A (Troja et al., GCN 15728) on
Jan., 15 with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory, and AZT-8
(0.7m) telescope of Institute of Astronomy, Kharkiv National University. We
obtained several unfiltered frames with exposures of 120 s (AS-32), and
several frames with filter R with exposure of 120 s (AZT-8). Within the
enhanced XRT circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 15733) we did not detect the
afterglow reported by Butler et al. (GCN 15732).

The details of the photometry are the following:

The photometry is based on SDSS stars, R mag (R mag obtained using ugriz
transformations in BVRI (Lupton, 2005):
