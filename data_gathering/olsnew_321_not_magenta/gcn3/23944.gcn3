The bright GRB 190305A (AGILE/MCAL detection: Ursi et al., GCN Circ.23930;
MAXI/GSC detection: Nakahira et al., GCN Circ. 23933;
Insight-HXMT/HE detection: Xiao et al., GCN Circ. 23934;
IPN Triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 23936;
Konus-Wind observation: Kozlova et al., GCN Circ. 23939)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 13:05:18.648 UTC
on 5 March 2019. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts at T=0.6 sec,
peaks at 1.6 sec and ends at T+3.7 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 1.4 +- 0.1 sec and
0.5 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
