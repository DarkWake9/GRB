H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U), T. Kato, M. Uemura and R. Ishioka (Kyoto U)
report: 

  The OT position given in GCN 1994 was obtained with respect to the
USN0-A2.0 reference stars (epoch 1955.2).  The large apparent proper
motions of several stars or the systematic displacements were the main
cause of the disagreement noticed by Taylor et al. (GCN 2129) and Henden
(GCN 2130).  Taking the same procedure as GCN 1994 but using the 2MASS
positions, we obtain a refined position of R.A. = 10:44:49.958 +/- 0.005,
Decl. = +21:31:17.51 +/- 0.07, which is in good agreement with the
radio and optical positions (GCN 2129, 2130).
