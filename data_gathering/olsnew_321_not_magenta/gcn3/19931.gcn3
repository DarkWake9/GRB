N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and J. L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 160917A
100 s after the BAT trigger (Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 19926). The
refined XRT position (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 19927) is close to a
bright star. However, a faint GRB candidate has been found at an
offset of 6.5 arcsec to the south east from the bright star in the
u exposures.
The UVOT candidate position is: RA, Dec = 295.66687, 46.40368 (J2000)
which is :
RA = 19:42:40.049
Dec = +46:24:13.25
with an estimated accuracy of 1.5 arcsec.

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures
are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.16 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
