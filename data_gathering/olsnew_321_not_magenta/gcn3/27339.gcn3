We carried out a follow-up observation of the afterglow of GRB 200306C
(Gropp et al GCNC 27326) using the 14-inch KCT (KIAS Chamnun Telescope) at
DeepSkyChile, Chile. A series of 30x120 s exposures on SDSS i-band were
obtained, starting at 04:37:13.849 UT on 06 March 2020.

We do not detect any sources on the stacked image at the previously
reported position of afterglow detections (Lipunov et al. GCN #27324, GCN
#27325, Jelinek et al. GCN #27328, Castro-Tirado et al. GCN #27329,
Moskvitin et al., GCN 27333, Izzo et al., GCN 27334, Kann et al., 27335).
After the flux calibration using SDSS dr12 photometric catalog, 5-sigma
detection limit is obtained as i > 18.40 AB magnitude.

KIAS Chamnun Telescope (KCT) is a 0.36m telescope of the Korea Institute
for Advanced Study (KIAS), recently installed at the DeepSkyChile site in
Chile. "Chamnun" is a Korean word for "True Eye", meaning the eye that can
see the truth.
Gravitational-wave EM Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) is a network
of 10+ 0.5m to 1m class telescopes over the world.
