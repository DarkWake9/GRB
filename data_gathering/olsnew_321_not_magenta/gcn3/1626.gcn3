Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and RHESSI observed this burst at 52203 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of about 10 s, a
25-100 keV fluence of about 3.7E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
over 0.5 s of 6.4E-7 erg/cm2 s.  We have triangulated it to a
preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)=175.675, 
+36.812 degrees, whose radius is 56.097 +/- 0.151 degrees
(3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival directions to ecliptic latitudes between 35 and
65 degrees, constraining the annulus to the sections between
RA, Decl=235.5, +16.4 and 251.5,+43.7 degrees, and between
RA, Decl=91.8, +58.4 and 23.5, +86.6 degrees.

This triangulation can be improved, but at this point it
is not clear whether this burst was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether an error box can be derived
for it.
