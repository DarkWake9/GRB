Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and D. M. Palmer report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.6 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode XRT data for the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 160117A (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 18882),
collected between T0+68.7 ks and T0+76.8 ks. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected inside or close to the
Swift/BAT error region, it is below the RASS limit and shows no
definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the present time we cannot
confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this source are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  20.3683  =  01:21:28.40
  Dec (J2000.0): -0.6542  =  -00:39:15.3
  Error: 3.9 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: 0.0142 +/- 0.0020 ct s^-1
  Flux: (4.04 +/- 0.58)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
