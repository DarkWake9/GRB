"At 00:48:11.32 UT on 4 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 130604B 
(trigger 391999694 / 130604.033).  The on-ground calculated 
location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 292.18,
Dec = -24.86 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 
19h 28m, -24d 51'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is 
additionally a systematic error which is currently estimated to
be 2 to 3 degrees).  The angle from the Fermi LAT 
boresight is 93 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-peak burst with a duration (T90)
of about 27 s (50 - 300 keV).  The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-8.192 to T0+35.841 s is well fit by a Comptonized
spectrum with Epeak = 227.6 +/- 19.0 and alpha = -1.24 +/- 0.03.
The fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(1.79 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The burst has a 1.024-s peak flux
(10-1000 keV) of 13.24 +/- 0.37 ph/cm^2/s that starts at
T+15.744 s.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
