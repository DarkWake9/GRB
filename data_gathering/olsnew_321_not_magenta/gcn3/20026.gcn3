SUBJECT: GRB 161011A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position

J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 985 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 2 UVOT
images for GRB 161011A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 245.72859, +8.31105 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 16h 22m 54.86s
Dec (J2000): +08d 18' 39.8"

with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
