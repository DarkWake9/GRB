The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 18/10/31 at 02:02:51 UT IceCube issued an alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/66412090_131680.amon)
reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of 
astrophysical origin. Upon further examination by the IceCube 
collaboration, the event was found to clearly *not* be of astrophysical 
origin.

This event was a rare case of near-in-time coincident events allowing a 
clear background event to pass the contained event selections.

We apologize for any confusion this error may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube 
realtimeÂ  alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
