We observed the field of GRB 170318A (Sbarufatti, et al., GCN 20904) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/03 18.51 to 2017/03 18.53 UTC (3.0 to
27.6 minutes after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.24 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.11 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We do not detect a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans, et al.,
GCN 20907).  In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain
the following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r > 23.39
 i > 22.82
 Z > 21.72
 Y > 21.56
 J > 21.12
 H > 20.73

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  We note that this field suffers
large Galactic extinction (A_V~3).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
