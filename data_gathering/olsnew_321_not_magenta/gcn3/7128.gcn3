Using the data set from T-239 to T+723 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071122 (trigger #297114)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 7121).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 276.576, 47.102 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 26m 18.2s
   Dec(J2000) = 47d 6' 6"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 69%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a single, rougly symmetrical peak
starting at ~T-30 sec, peaking at ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+60 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 68.7 +- 14.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-29.4 to T+47.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.31.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.8 +- 1.1 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
