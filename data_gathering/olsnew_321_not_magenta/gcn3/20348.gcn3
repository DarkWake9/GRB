Radoslaw Marcinkowski (PSI), Hualin Xiao (PSI) and Wojtek Hajdas (PSI) report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2016-12-28T13:15:40.0 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 161228B,
which was also observed by Fermi GBM (trigger #504623745) and SPIACS (trigger: 2016-12-28T13-15-39.8537-31044-07056-0).

The POLAR light curve consists of one peak with duration (T90) of 8.5 +- 0.5 s measured from T0.
The  0.5 s peak flux at T0 + 3.25 s  is equal to 450 +- 40 cnts/sec.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 80 - 500 keV.

Using the best location from the Fermi-GBM, which is (J2000):

RA: 129.290  [deg]
	
Dec: 43.670  [deg]

Err:  2.24   [deg]

the incident angle in the POLAR coordinate at T0 is:

Theta: 28.7  [deg]

Phi: 13.9  [deg]

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Calibration of the instrument is ongoing.

POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which was launched on-board the Chinese space
laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
