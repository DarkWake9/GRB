"We observed GRB 210905A (Sonbas et al., GCN 30765) with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at multiple frequencies beginning on 2021
Sep 08 14:20 UT. We detect a radio counterpart at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz at a
position consistent with the X-ray position (Beardmore et al., GCN 30768),
optical position (Strausbaugh & Cucchiara, GCN 30769), and mm-band position
(Laskar et al., GCN 30783) with a flux density of ~ 0.1 mJy at 9.0 GHz at a
mid-time of 3.65 days after the burst.

We thank the CSIRO staff for approving and scheduling these observations.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope
National Facility which is funded by the Australian Government for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO. We acknowledge the
Gomeroi people as the traditional owners of the Observatory site."
