report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:


On December, 02, 2016 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB
161202A, which was also detected by Swift (GCN 20227).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 356.95, 19.49 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.13 deg (90 % containment, statistical error
only), which is fully compatible with the enhanced Swift/XRT position
reported in GCN 20228.

This was outside the field of view of the LAT at the time of the
trigger t0 =  23:12:52.7. The location of the GRB was observed however
between t0 + 1680 s and t0 + 3500 s. During this time interval, the
data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
correlated with the trigger with high significance.

5 photons were detected above 100 MeV. The highest-energy photon is a
4 GeV event which is observed 2000 seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Giacomo Vianello
(giacomov@stanford.edu).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of
an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and
many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
