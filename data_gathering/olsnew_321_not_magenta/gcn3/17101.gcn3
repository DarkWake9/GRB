We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 26.31 to 2014/11 26.53
UTC (123.55 to 128.80 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
4.04 hours exposure in the r, i and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

r = 21.27 +/- 0.04
i = 21.04 +/- 0.04
z > 21.04

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The afterglow has faded by about 0.3 magnitudes in r and i compared to
our observations at 102 hours (Watson et al., GCN 17100). This
corresponds to a further steepening of the temporal power law from
t^-0.9 between 78 and 102 hours (Watson et al., GCN 17100) to t^-1.3
between 102 and 126 hours.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
