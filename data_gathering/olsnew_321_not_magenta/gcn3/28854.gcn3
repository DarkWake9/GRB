report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of ZTF20acozryr/AT2020yxz (Coughlin et al. GCN 
28841), likely the optical afterglow of GRB 201103B (Svinkin et al., GCN 
28844), using the 2.16m telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera at 
Xinglong, Hebei, China. Observations started at 14:12:36 UT on 
2020-11-06, and 8x180s R-band frames were obtained.

The source is clearly detected in our stacked image, with R = 20.36 +/- 
0.05 mag at Tmid-T0 = 2.8373 days post-burst, calibrated with nearby 
Pan-STARRS1.

We acknowledge excellent support from the Xinglong-2.16m observing 
staff, in particular Jie Zheng.
