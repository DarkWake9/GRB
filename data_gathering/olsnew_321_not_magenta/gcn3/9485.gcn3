report:

We observed the field of GRB090529A (trigger=353540, Sakamato et al. 2009
GCN Circ. 9430, also GCN Circ. 9431-9436,9448,9449,9457) with the 
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National 
Observatory, Turkey) on 30 May  starting at 00:09:01.86 UT about 9.94 hours 
(0.414 d) after the burst
using the TFOSC CCD (burst detected at 14:12:35 UT with Swift Burst Alert 
Telescope (BAT)).

We obtained one 900 sec exposure using the  R band  filter (Bessell filter). We 
found the afterglow candidate at the location designated by the Swift XRT 
position given by Osborne et al. 2009 GCN Circ. 9433. We performed PSF 
photometry using DAOPHOT within MIDAS software on the 13.3 by 13.3 arcmin field 
around the afterglow candidate. We calibrated the R band magnitude
using the same  USNO-B1 reference star noted by Kann et al. 2009 GCN Circ. 
9436. The GRB090529 afterglow candidate is detected at R = 21.2+/-0.2 mag.
