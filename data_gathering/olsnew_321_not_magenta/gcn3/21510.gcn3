The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

In GCN 21509, we reported the identification of a binary neutron star
candidate. We had stated that actual luminosity distance to the source is
likely larger than the estimated effective distance. The effective
distance quoted estimates the *maximum* distance to the source and so the
actual luminosity distance is can be *smaller* than the estimate of the
effective distance.

The BAYESTAR localization generated from H1 data only estimates an actual
luminosity distance of 37 +/- 12 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation). The distance estimate will likely evolve with further offline
follow-up using data from H1, L1, and V1.

Analyses including data from H1, L1, and V1 are still ongoing and a
sky-map using gravitational-wave data will be made available as quickly as
possible.
