collaboration report:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star candidate G298048 on 
Aug 17 (GCNC 21509), we used the JGT 0.6m robotic telescope at the 
BOOTES-5 station at Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de San Pedro Mártir (México) 
to image the 15 galaxies in the GLADE Catalogue (GCN 21516) starting on 
Aug 18.21 UT. The potential optical candidate (GCN 21529) was only 
imaged on Aug 19.21 UT, with the images quality being affected by the 
very high airmass and the twilight sky. The optical candidate (SSS17a) is 
only barely visible in the outskirts of the NGC 4993 galaxy. A more 
detailed analysis of the data is in progress.

We thank the staff of Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.

[GCN OPS NOTE(21aug17): Per author's request, (a) the SSS17a name was corrected
for a typo, (b) Lee's name was corrected, (c) OAN's name was corrected, and
(d) the second paragraph was added.]
