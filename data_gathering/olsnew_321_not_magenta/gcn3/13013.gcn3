"At 01:55:34.00 UT on March 02 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120302A (trigger 352346136 / 120302080),
which was also found in the ground analysis of the Swift/BAT data
(Sakamoto et al. 2012, GCN 13000). The Swift position is within
the 3 sigma statistical error contour of the GBM on-ground location.

The GBM light curve shows a short peak starting at about T-1.5s,
followed by a plateau of about 20s and a weaker emission tail.
The duration (T90) is of about 70 s (50-300 keV), which is
consistent with the light curve observed by Swift considering
the Swift/BAT data stops at T+30s (Sakamoto et al, GCN 13002).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to T0+67 s is
well fit by a simple power law function with index -1.62 +/- 0.06
(Castor stat 453.64 for 367 d.o.f.), which is consistent with the
results reported by Sakamoto et al (GCN 13002).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.84 +/- 0.08)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.536 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
