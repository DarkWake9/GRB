T.J. Galama, P. Vreeswijk (U. of Amsterdam), J. van Paradijs (U. of
Amsterdam and U. of Alabama in Huntsville), C. Kouveliotou
(USRA/MSFC), R. Strom (NFRA and U. of Amsterdam), G. de Bruyn (NFRA
and U. of Groningen) report:

"We have observed the location of the X-ray source (GCN #178) in the
error box of GRB 981226 (GCN #174) with the Westerbork Radio Synthesis
Telescope (WSRT). We observed for 6.4 hours at 4.88 GHz on Dec 29.70
UT, 1998. We find no sources at the location of the X-ray source down
to 360 microJy (4 sigma). In particular, we find no radio counterparts
to the optical objects noted by Galama et al. (GCN #172), Castro-
Tirado et al. (GCN #173) and Wozniak et al. (GCN #177). These results
are consistent with those by Frail et al. (GCN #180)."
