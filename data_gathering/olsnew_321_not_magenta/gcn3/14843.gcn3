A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), F.J. Virgili(LJMU), C.G. Mundell (LJMU) and A. 
Gomboc (U. Ljubljana) report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically followed up GRB130610A (Swift 
trigger 557845, Cummings et al., GCN 14842) 15.5  min after the GRB 
trigger time observing with SLOAN-gri filters.

The automatic LT-TRAP procedure detected an uncatalogued fading source 
candidate at:

RA = 14:57:40.89
Dec = +28:12:25.5    (J2000)

with magnitude R~17.9 mag (vs USNOB1) ~16 min after the burst trigger.  
The object is clearly fading in all filters.

Observations and analysis are ongoing.
