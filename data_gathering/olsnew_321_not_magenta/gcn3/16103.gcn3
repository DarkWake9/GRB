Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140412A (trigger #595608)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 16097).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 145.032, -65.826 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 40m 07.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 49' 33.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks strting at ~T-35 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+35 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 39.6 +- 8.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-36.94 to T+12.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.95 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.2 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
