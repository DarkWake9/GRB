Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 18:03:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180311A (trigger=813721).  Swift slewed to the burst after
a brief delay to clear the Earth limb observing contraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 3.433, -54.479 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 13m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 28' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex peak
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 18:08:24.5 UT, 275.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 3.39027, -54.49162 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 13m 33.66s
   Dec(J2000) = -54d 29' 29.8"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 100 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.59 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4.9
(+3.32/-2.86) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 279 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 26% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.01.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
