The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 19:38:38 UT on 9 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200509B (trigger 610745923.819 / 200509818).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 75.3, Dec = 71.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 01m, 71d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 114.0 degrees.
