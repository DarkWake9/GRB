A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2004 Oct. 7.25 UT (t ~ 18 hrs) we carried out follow-up
observations with the VLA at 8.46 and 4.96 GHz centered on the optical
afterglow (GCN 2765) of GRB 041006 (GCN 2770).  Within a circle of
1-arcsec radius, there are no radio sources detected at either frequency.
We place 2-sigma upper limits of 82 and 118 microJy at 8.46 and 4.96 GHz,
respectively."
