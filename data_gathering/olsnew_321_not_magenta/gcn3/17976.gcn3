(INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU), T.G.R. Roegiers
(PSU), L.M. McCauley (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U.
Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 150627A (Arimoto et al. GCN Circ. 17971),
collecting 4.9 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+33.6 ks
and T0+51.0 ks. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected inside or close to the
Fermi/LAT error region and is above the RASS limit, and is therefore
likely the GRB afterglow.  The position of this source is RA,
Dec=117.4706, -51.4900 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 07:49:52.94
Dec(J2000): -51:29:23.9

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 4.3 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=2.2 (+/-0.3).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.99 (+/-0.13). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.5 (+/-0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 2.6 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.8 x 10^-11 (5.8 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.5 (+/-0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.6 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.8 sigma
Photon index:	     1.99 (+/-0.13)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.2, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.066 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.5 x
10^-12 (3.8 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
