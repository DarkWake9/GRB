The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:12:01 UT on 18 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191118A (trigger 595807926.820754 / 191118925).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 214.0, Dec = -48.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 16m, -48d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 105.0 degrees.
