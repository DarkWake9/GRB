After  SWIFT alert  (GCN 2951)  MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had  imaging  the
corresponding area of the sky.  We have unfiltered
images of the error box (45s exposition, 6 square degrees
field) started at 17 Jan 2005	14:58:40 UT (after 2 hours GRB time).
The limiting magnitude on the first image was about 17.0.

There is no  OT within the SWIFT error circle.
JPG-images  are available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/SRG1806-20/050117/

Observations are continued.
