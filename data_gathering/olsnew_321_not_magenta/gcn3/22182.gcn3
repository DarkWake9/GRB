We observed the field of GRB 171205A (D'Elia, et al., GCN 22177) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/12 5.40 to 2017/12 5.53 UTC (2.15 to 5.36
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.44 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 0.71 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we detect and obtain the
following photometry for the source reported by Izzo et al. (GCN 22180):

 r = 18.30 +/- 0.05
 i = 18.13 +/- 0.02
 Z = 18.35 +/- 0.05
 Y = 18.13 +/- 0.05

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
