A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), M. Capalbi (INAF-IASFPA), M. Perri (SSDC
& INAF-OAR), V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), B. Sbarufatti (PSU), D.N.
Burrows (PSU), J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst GRB 210622A (James DeLaunay et al. GCN
Circ. 30302), collecting 4.5 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data
between T0+171.2 ks and T0+221.6 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 246
arcsec of the Swift/BAT-GUANO position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the
field is 0.003 ct  s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
1.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

An uncatalogued was detected, however this was too far from the GRB
position to be the afterglow.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021452.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
