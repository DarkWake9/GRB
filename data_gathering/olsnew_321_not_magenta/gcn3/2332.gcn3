TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 48701
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 30
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.0E-05 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.4E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 156.737,  26.594 degrees, whose radius is 64.285 +/-  0.014
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival direction to ecliptic latitudes between -36 and -40
degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus between
approximately RA, Decl=104.9, -13.5 degrees and 109.2, -18.1 degrees.

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
