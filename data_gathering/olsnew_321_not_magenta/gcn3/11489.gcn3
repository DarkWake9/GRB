Sheila McBreen reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:27:13.86 UT on 24 December 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101224A (trigger 314861235/101224227),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Krimm et al. 2010, GCN 11484).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one pulse
with a duration of about 0.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 to T0+0.256 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.83 (+0.38/-0.30) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 330 (+402/-150) keV
(CSTAT  509 for 488 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.4 +/- 0.5)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.40 +/- 0.82 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
