Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181103A (trigger #870201)
(Tohuvavohu, et al., GCN Circ. 23402).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 197.093, 52.220 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 08m 22.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +52d 13' 11.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.

The mask-weighted light curves shows a single FRED-shaped peak from 
T0-1 sec, peaking at T0, and decaying to background by T0+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.38 +- 2.41 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.89 to T+10.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.90 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
