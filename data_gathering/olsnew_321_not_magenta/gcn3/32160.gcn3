SUBJECT: Fermi-GBM will trial new SAA regions from Tuesday June 7th

O.J. Roberts (USRA) and C. Fletcher (USRA) report 
on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

From Tuesday June 7th 2022, Fermi-GBM will be investigating 
alternative reductions in its definition of the South Atlantic 
Anomaly (SAA) region in order to improve its operational 
efficiency. This re-evaluation is due to the evolution of the SAA 
region over the mission lifetime. We anticipate the increase in 
GBMâ€™s operational efficiency to be of the order of several 
percent depending on which region is finally chosen,  which will 
be beneficial for future follow-up to multi-wavelength events 
of interest and during scheduled observational campaigns. 

During these investigations, observers within the community may 
notice a number of spurious triggers by the spacecraft while 
transiting the trialed regions. We anticipate our tests to last a 
couple of weeks and we will send out a statement informing the 
community when the tests have concluded. Alerts for any 
misclassified events will be addressed promptly by Fermi-GBM 
burst advocates via GCN circulars, in order to best advise the 
community on how to follow up each event during this time. 
We thank you for your patience and understanding.
