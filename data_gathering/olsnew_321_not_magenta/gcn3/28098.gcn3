The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:35:05 UT on 14 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200714E (trigger 616444510.078062 / 200714774).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 215.8, Dec = -49.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 23m, -49d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 92.0 degrees.
