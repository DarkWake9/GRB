report:

We observed the afterglow (Laha et al. GCN #29444, Lipunov et al. GCN
#29447, de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN #29450, Breeveld & Laha, GCN
#29457, Strausbaugh & Cucchiara, GCN #29459, Jelinek et al. GCN
#29469,  D. A. Kann et al. GCN #29476) of the GRB 210210A (Laha et al.
GCN #29444) with 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at
Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of
observational sciencES (ARIES), India. We obtained multiple images in
R and I bands with an exposure of 180 seconds each. We detect the
optical afterglow with a magnitude of 21.35 +- 0.07 in R-band at 0.88
days after the burst. Further observations are ongoing with 1.3m DFOT
and 3.6m DOT.

The magnitude is not corrected for the Galactic extinction in the
direction of the burst. The photometric calibration is performed using
the standard stars from the USNO-B1.0 catalog.
