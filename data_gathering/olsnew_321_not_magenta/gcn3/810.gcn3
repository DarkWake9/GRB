report on behalf of the CONCAM collaboration:

"The CONtinuous CAMera (CONCAM) operating on the roof of the 
RMT building at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona has 
recorded data that provides very crude limits on the attributes 
of the OT through non-detection.  

Before the GRB Trigger
From (2000 September 26.135) to (2000 September 26.263), spanning from
roughly 20.6 hours to 17.5 hours before the Konus trigger, no obvious
optical transient brighter than visual magnitude 4 was recorded. 

After the GRB Trigger
From (2000 September 27.100) to (2000 September 27.252), spanning from
roughly 2.6 hours to 6.2 hours after the Konus trigger, no obvious
optical transient brighter than visual magnitude 4 was recorded.

These above results were derived from a visual inspection of a series 
of two-minute exposures of the nearly 2 pi steradian CONCAM field.  
A more detailed inspection of the data might improve these magnitude 
limits to approximately visual magnitude 6.  Data remains freely 
available at http://concam.net .
