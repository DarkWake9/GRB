A. Volnova (SAI MSU/IKI), I. Korobtsev (ISTP), E. Klunko (ISTP),   A. 
Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 130131B (Siegel et al., GCN 
14159) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) on Jan. 31 
between (UT) 19:51:32-20:51:58. We took several images in R-filter of 60 
s exposure. Within enhanced XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 14165) we do 
not detect any source in a combined image. Photometry is based on nearby 
SDSS DR8 stars.

UT start,    t-t0           filter      Exp.   OT      UL (3 sigma)
             (mid, days)                (s)
