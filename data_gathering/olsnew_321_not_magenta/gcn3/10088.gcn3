Dale A. Frail (NRAO), Poonam Chandra (RMC), and Tanay Singh
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the field of view
towards the Swift burst GRB 091020A (GCN 10048, 10050, 10051) at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. Data has been taken at 6 different epochs:
October 21.66, 22.54, 22.77, 22.99, 24.60 and 26.71 UT. The average
flux density of the source during the first 4 epochs was 108 +/- 25
uJy. The source has since increased in flux, rising to 230 +/- 42 uJy
on Oct 24.60 UT and 436 +/- 42 uJy on Oct. 26.71 UT. Our current
best-fit position is (J2000) R.A.=11:42:55.268, Dec.=+50:58:41.36 with
a conservative error of +/-0.6". Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
