INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

On 2004 August 02, HETE (FREGATE and WXM), Mars Odyssey (HEND),
Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) detected H3485, a 2.9 s long (T90)
gamma-ray burst.  Ulysses was off.  The Earth-crossing time was
64901.03 s.  The HETE localization was sent out in a series of 8 GCN
notices.  Triangulation using the IPN spacecraft resulted in an annulus
centered at RA, Decl (2000)= 327.8358, -14.1907 degrees, whose radius
is 47.7170 +/- 0.0315 degrees (3 sigma).  This annulus intersects the
WXM error box given in GCN Notice Sequence 8 to form an ~80 square
arcminute error box whose corners are at

RA(2000)    Decl(2000)
282.997     -42.516781
283.043     -42.433411
283.208     -42.884371
283.253     -42.801818

The fluences in the 7-30, 30-400, and 2-30 keV ranges were 0.49, 2.04,
and 0.56 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.  The ratio of the X-ray to gamma-ray
fluences was ~0.24, making this a classical GRB.  The pseudo-redshift
was 1.7.

HETE detected this burst during a flare from GRS1915+105, making the
localization unusually difficult.  We apologize for any confusion.
