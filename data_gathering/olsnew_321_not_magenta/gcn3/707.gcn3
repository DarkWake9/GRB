TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  707
SUBJECT: GRB000615: BeppoSAX NFI follow-up preliminary analysis
DATE:    00/06/16 11:06:10 GMT
FROM:    Giangiacomo Gandolfi at IAS/CNR Frascati  <gandolfi@ias.rm.cnr.it>

A BeppoSAX follow up of GRB000615 with the Narrow Field Instruments
started around June 15 at 16:20 UT, i.e. about 10 hours after the GRB.

A quick look analysis of the first orbits of MECS (1.6-10 keV) data shows
a faint and previously unknown source inside the field.

The coordinates are:

R.A.(2000)= 233.058
DEC(2000)= 73.814

with a 1.5' error radius.
This object may be compatible with a radio source from NVSS Catalogue 1.3'
away (RA: 233.043, DEC: 73.835) and not necessarily associated to the GRB.
