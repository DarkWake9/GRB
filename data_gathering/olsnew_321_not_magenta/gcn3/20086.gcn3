SUBJECT: GRB 161020A: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), V. Savchenko (APC, Paris), D.Gotz (CEA, 
Saclay), C.Ferrigno (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 15 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:34:40 UT of 2016 October 20. This burst was also 
detected by Fermi/GBM (trigger num. 498616490).

The burst occurred immediately after the end of a slew of the INTEGRAL 
satellite. For this reason the corresponding IBAS Alert was not 
distributed in real time.

From an offline analysis we derived the burst coordinates (J2000):

R.A.=  161.0309 deg
DEC.=  -54.7687 deg

with an uncertainty of about 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.8 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 4e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
