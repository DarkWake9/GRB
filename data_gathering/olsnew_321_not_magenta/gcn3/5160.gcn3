(RIKEN) on behalf of the WIDGET collaboration report: 

"We have observed the entire error region of the Swift GRB 060413
(Pagani et al., GCN 4957, 4959) with the very wide-field camera,
WIDGET, located at Akeno, Japan.  WIDGET has continuously monitored
the Swift Field-of-View with repeat of unfiltered 5-second exposures
between 26 seconds before and 335 seconds after the burst. The 1-sigma
limiting magnitude of each frame derived by the Tycho-2 catalog was
around V=10 mag. There was no significant emission from the X-ray
afterglow position up to the limiting magnitudes."
