E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Beginning on February 15.42 UT we observed the inner ~25% of the HETE II
error circle of GRB010213 (GCN#934) with the VLA at 1.43 GHz.  Inside this
region we detect one weak source, which is not cataloged in the NRAO VLA
Sky Survey (NVSS), at RA=10:31:08.08, DEC=5:32:08.26 with a conservative
error of 0.5" in each.  In addition, we detect several sources which
correspond to cataloged NVSS sources.  We note that the uncataloged source
is at the detection threshold of NVSS.  Further observations with the VLA
are planned, and we urge optical observers to try to confirm this
detection."
