D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this GRB
at 32605 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 105 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
5.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  8.4E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 152.354, 36.983 degrees, whose radius is 66.151 +/-  0.034
degrees (3 sigma ).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival direction to ecliptic latitudes between -48 and -32
degrees, that is, to that portion of the annulus between RA, Decl =
101.6, -9.1 degrees and 164.0, -28.2 degrees.

This annulus may be further constrained and/or improved, but as the
event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be
derived for it.
