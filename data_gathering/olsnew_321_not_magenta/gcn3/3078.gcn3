D. Fugazza, P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino (INAF-OABr), D. Malesani (SISSA), N. 
Masetti, E. Palazzi (IASF-CNR), L.A. Antonelli (INAF-OARm), and G. 
Andreuzzi (INAF-TNG), report on behalf of a larger Italian collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 050306 (Markwardt et al., GCN 3071) with 
the 3.6m TNG telescope, located in the Canary Islands. Observations were 
carried out in the R and I bands, under moderate observing conditions 
(high humidity, seeing ~1.5", airmass ~2). R-band observations started 
on 2004 Mar 8.22 UT (2.07 days after the burst), and yielded 20 minutes 
of net exposure.

Inside the 6-arcsec error circle of the candidate X-ray afterglow (Perri 
et al., GCN 3075) we find several sources. Four of them are close to the 
center (to within ~3"), while the remaining ones are right on the 
border. All are fainter than the DSS limit. The large number of sources 
is consistent with the crowding of this field lying towards the Galactic 
plane.

At this stage, we are not able to single out any candidate afterglow. 
Further observations are planned tonight in order to seek for variable 
objects.
