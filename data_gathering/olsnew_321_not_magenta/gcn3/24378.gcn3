The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 19/05/03 at 17:23:08 UT IceCube detected a track-like, 
very-high-energy event with a high probability of being of astrophysical 
origin. The  event was identified by the Extremely High Energy (EHE) 
track event selection.  The IceCube detector was in a normal operating 
state.  EHE events typically have a neutrino interaction vertex that is 
outside the detector, produce a muon that traverses the detector volume, 
and have a high light level (a proxy for energy).

After the initial automated alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/42419327_132508.amon), more 
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with 
the direction refined to:


Date: 19/05/03
Time: 17:23:08.72 UT
RA: 120.28 (+0.57 -0.77 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 6.35 (+0.76 -0.70 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help 
identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% region. The 
nearest known gamma-ray source is 4FGL J0800.9+0733 at RA: 120.2262 deg, 
Dec: 7.5509 deg (1.2 deg away from the best-fit event position).


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
