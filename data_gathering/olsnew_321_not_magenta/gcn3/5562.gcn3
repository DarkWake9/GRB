C. P. Hurkett, K.L. Page and E. Rol (U Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit observation
of GRB 060912 (Hurkett et al., GCN 5558), with a total exposure of
1.7 ks seconds.  The refined XRT position is:

   RA(J2000) =  00 21 08.23
  Dec(J2000) = +20 58 15.8

This position is 10.9 arcseconds from the BAT position given in GCN
5558 (Hurkett et al. 2006), 2.8 arcseconds from the XRT position and
2.0 arcseconds from the UVOT given in the same GCN. We estimate an
uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).

The 0.3-10.0 keV Photon Counting (PC) mode starts 135 seconds after the 
BAT trigger (T0). The count rate is declining with a decay slope of 0.62 
(+/-0.12).

A preliminary spectral fit to the PC data gives a spectral power law 
photon index of 2.08 +/- 0.20 in the [0.3-10] keV band, with a free 
absorption of 0.17 (+/- 0.06)e22 cm^-2 (Galactic absorption at this 
location is 4.20e20 cm^-2).  The average (in the time range 135-1860 
seconds from trigger) estimated unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux is then about 
2.9E-11 erg/cm2/s.

The XRT count rate extrapolated to T0+24 hr is estimated to be about 0.025 
cps, corresponding to an unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of about 1.73E-12 
erg/cm2/s.
