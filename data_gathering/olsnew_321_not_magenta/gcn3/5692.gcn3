The pseudo-redshifts of GRB 060928 given in GCN Circular 5690
have been erroneously computed with the spectral parameters
of the 1st peak of this GRB.

A computation based on a 15 sec long intervalle near the
maximum of the burst gives a smaller pseudo-redshift

pz = 1.3 +/- 0.2

We apologize for this mistake.
