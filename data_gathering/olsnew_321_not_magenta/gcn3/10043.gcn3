We have observed the afterglow of GRB 091018 (Stamatikos et al. CGN
10034) with the 0.6m Yock-Allen telescope (BOOTES-3) located in
Blenheim (New Zealand). A combination of 21x30s unfiltered images with
mean epoch Oct. 19.625 UT (18.2 hours after the burst) shows the  
afterglow
at a magnitude of R=20.0+/-0.3. The photometry has been obtained using
as comparison 5 USNO-B1.0 stars. This magnitude implies a rough
decay slope of alpha = 0.7 +/- 0.2 (with F ~ t^(-alpha)) as compared to
the values of Filgas et al. (GCN 10039). Further analysis is ongoing.
