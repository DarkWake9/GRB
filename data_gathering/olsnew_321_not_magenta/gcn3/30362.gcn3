The long bright GRB 210702A (Swift detection: Lien et al., GCN Circ. 30351;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/210702A.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 19:07:06.474 UTC on 2 July 2021
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1309287819/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a FRED-like pulse which starts at T+2.1 sec,
peaks at T+6.3 sec,and ends at T+51.3 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 32.1 +- 4.6 sec and 9.2 +- 0.9 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
