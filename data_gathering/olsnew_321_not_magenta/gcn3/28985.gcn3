M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 06:52:27 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201203A (trigger=1010946).  
Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 38.080, -26.538 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 32m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 32' 14"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 06:54:27.2 UT, 120.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of  68 seconds with the White filter
starting 123 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.02. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Dichiara (dichiara AT umd.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
