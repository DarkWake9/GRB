E. Berger (Carnegie) reports:

"Starting on 2006 Dec. 21.07 UT we used LDSS3 on Magellan to obtain an 
1800 sec spectrum of the galaxy located 17 arcsec NW of the optical 
afterglow of the short GRB 061201 (see also GCN #5884).  This is the 
nearest bright galaxy (R~19 mag) to the GRB position.  We detect several 
emission lines, which we identify as H-beta, [OIII], H-alpha, [NII], and 
[SII] at a redshift of z=0.111.  At this redshift the projected offset of 
the burst is about 34 kpc, significantly smaller than about 1.9 Mpc 
relative to the center of Abell 995 (GCN #5944)."
