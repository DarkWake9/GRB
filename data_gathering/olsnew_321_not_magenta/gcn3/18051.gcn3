report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:23:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a source consistent with the location of the known source 
IGR J00291+5934 (=V1037 Cas) (trigger=650140).  Swift could not
slew immediately to the burst due to an Earth limb constraint.  The 
BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 7.200, +59.565 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 28m 48s
   Dec(J2000) = +59d 33' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  No light curve is immediately available
for this image trigger. 

Although this is a marginal significance (6.11 sigma) image
trigger, it is likely to be a true detection, based on the
close match (2 arcminutes) to the source location and
the fact that this source is often seen by BAT. 

To avoid confusion, we note that this is not GRB 150724A, 
which occurred shortly after this detection.
