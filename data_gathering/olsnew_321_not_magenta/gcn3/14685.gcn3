R. Sánchez-Ramírez (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (UPV-EHU, IAA-CSIC), A. J.
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), J. Cepa and G. Gómez-Velarde (IAC), on behalf of
a larger collaboration, report:

We observed the location of the Fermi GRB 130518A (Xiong et al. GCNC 14674,
Omodei et al. GCNC 14675) -also detected by Swift and Konus (Cummings et
al. GCNC 14676, Golenetskii et al. GCNC 14677)- with the OSIRIS
spectrograph mounted at the 10.4m GTC located at Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). Observations began on May 20.1995
UT (i.e. 38.9 hr post burst). The optical afterglow (Evans et al. GCNC
14678, Troja et al. GCNC 14579) is well detected with the blue (R1000B)
grism and in the resulting spectrum we see a strong, broad damped-Lya
absorption feature at ~4100A, combined with many metal lines including
SII, SiII, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII, AlII and AlIII at a common redshift of
z=2.49.

We thank E. Troja and the RATIR Team for providing the ID-chart.
