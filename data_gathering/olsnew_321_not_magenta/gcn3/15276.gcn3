D. Kocevski (NASA/GSFC/ORAU), H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 19:09:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130930A (trigger=572489).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 190.661, -35.502 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 42m 39s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 30' 08"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with image triggers, the BAT 
light curve showed no significant structure. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 03:51 UT on 2013 November 26. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
