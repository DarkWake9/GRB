Gendre, B (LAM-OAMP), Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. 
(LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 081028 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 332851) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 566.4s after the GRB trigger
(423.2s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased
from 16 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were very poor.

The first useful image started 4054.0 s after the notice. We co-added all 
exposure between 4054 and 6499 seconds. At the position reported by Clemens 
et al. (GCN 8424) and Olofsson et al. (GCN 8425), we do not detect any 
transient source, with a limit of R ~ 17.4. We do not detect any other 
source not present in the DSS.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
