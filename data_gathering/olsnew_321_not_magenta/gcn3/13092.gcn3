report on behalf of the LJMU GRB group:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope automatically observed
Swift GRB 120324A (Zhang et al. GCN Circ. 13090)
on March 24, from 06:13:42 UT, corresponding to
14.5 minutes after the BAT trigger time.
Within the XRT error circle we detect an uncatalogued
object with 20.3 +- 0.3 mag in the r' band at the
following position

19:24:18.76   +24:07:50.1  (J2000).

At the moment we cannot make any statement about its
possible variability.
Magnitudes are calibrated against nearby USNOB-1 stars.
