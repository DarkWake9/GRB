S. Dichiara and C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara) on behalf of
a large collaboration report:

The Las Cumbres Observatory 2-m Faulkes Telescope North in
Hawaii re-observed Swift GRB 141121A (Lien et al. GCN
Circ 17075) on November 23 at 10:43:39 UT, i.e. ~2.29 days
after the BAT trigger, with the r' and i' filters.

We confirm the rebrightening of the optical afterglow
reported by RATIR (Watson et al. GCN 17090) with the
following magnitudes:

Mid time from  Total Exp   Filter    Magnitude
trigger (days)  (s)
-------------------------------------------------
2.31           120x10       r'        20.61 +- 0.04
2.29           120x10       i'        20.34 +- 0.05
-------------------------------------------------

Magnitudes are calibrated against nearby SDSS stars.
Observations are going on.
