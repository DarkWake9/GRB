U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160703A detected by SWIFT(trigger 702699)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy. Member of: 
AAVSO - American Association of Variable Star Observers.
ISSP - Italian Supernovae Search Project.
UAI/SSV - Unione Astrofili Italiani/sezione stelle variabili.

The observations started 8.31 hour after the GRB trigger,  
with our Schmidt telescope D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures of 120 sec each.

Start T0+      End T0+      Vlim
8.31 hour    10.28 hour      19

We did not found any optical counterpart in the error box of the XRTcandidate.
(S. B. Cenko (GSFC), V. D'Elia (ASDC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), et al.)

Magnitudes were estimated with the UCAC4 cat. and 
are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
