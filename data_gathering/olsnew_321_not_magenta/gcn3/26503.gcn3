We report the photometric measurements of AT2019wxt (GCN #26485)
associated with the gravitational wave event S191213g (GCN #26402)
using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan. The observations
were conducted using g, r, i filters for 300 sec each starting at
2019-12-19 10:42:45 UT. Preliminary photometry (AB) was obtained by
calibrating with the PS1 catalogue. We obtained g=19.50+/-0.04,
r=19.40+/-0.03, and i=19.47+/-0.06.

Compared to the Palomar observations taken 6 hours earlier (GCN
#26500), AT2019wxt remains at the same brightness level.

We would like to thank the staff in Lulin Observatory for helping the
observations.
