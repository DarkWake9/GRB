We report serendipitous observations of GRB210104A (Troja et al. GCN
29233) by ATLAS, the twin telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna
Loa that surveys the whole northern sky every 2 days (see Tonry et
al. 2018, PASP, 130f4505).  Optical transients are automatically
detected on the difference images and discoveries (Smith et al. 2020,
PASP, 132h5002) are made public through the IAU Transient Name Server.

During the course of its survey, ATLAS happened to be observing the
field of GRB210104A starting 1min 47sec after the Swift BAT trigger at
2021-01-04 11:26:59 UT (Troja et al. GCN 29233). This was a fortunate
coincidence in normal survey mode and not a triggered pointing.

We detect the bright UVOT afterglow as initially reported in (Troja et
al. GCN 29233), and appear to have the caught it early and bright at
o = 13.9 along with rapid fading (see also Xin et al, GCN29235, Hu et
al. 29236, Hosokawa et al. GCN 29237, Kim et al. GCN 29238, Lipunov et
al. 29239),

It was detected at a position : 
RA = 06:55:05.37 (103.77240) DEC = +64:40:34.2 (+64.67618) 
              
The expoures were 30sec long in the o-band (an r+i composite),
with start time and magnitudes as follows :
