S. Ozawa (Waseda U) A. Yoshida, T. Sakamoto, V. Pal'shin, 
S. Sugita (AGU), Y. Kawakubo (LSU), K. Yamaoka (Nagoya U),
S. Nakahira (RIKEN), Y. Asaoka, S. Torii (Waseda U), 
Y. Shimizu, T. Tamura (Kanagawa U), N. Cannady (GSFC/UMBC), 
M. L. Cherry (LSU), S. Ricciarini (U of Florence),
P. S. Marrocchesi (U of Siena),
and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190814bv,
T0 = 2019-08-14 21:10:39.013 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25324, 25333), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-10 min to 
T0+7 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy
trigger mode at the trigger time of S190814bv, but the CAL FOV 
does not have any overlap with LVC probability significance map.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA= 181.3 deg, DEC= 49.5 deg at T0.
