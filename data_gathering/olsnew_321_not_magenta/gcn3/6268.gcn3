SUBJECT: GRB 070411: Tautenburg RRM Afterglow Confirmation

D. A. Kann, S. Schulze, U. Laux, S. Klose (TLS Tautenburg) and J. 
Greiner (MPE) report:

The location of the Swift GRB 070411 (Moretti et al., GCN 
6267) was observed in good conditions but at high airmass with 
the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt Telescope in Rapid Response 
Mode (Klose et al., GCN 3609) upon receipt of the BAT 
position.

The first image (Rc Band, 180 sec integration) was started at 
20:18:15 UT, 5 minutes and 42 seconds after the burst trigger.

We confirm a bright stationary source in the flight-localized 
XRT error circle, in accordance with the UVOT position (Moretti 
et al., GCN 6267). The afterglow was discovered independently 
of the UVOT observation.

Further analysis and observations are in progress.
