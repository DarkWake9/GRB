Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U.
Leicester), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), S.L. Gibson (U. Leicester), A.
Melandri (INAF-OAB) and T.N. Ukwatta report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 15 ks of XRT data for GRB 151029A (Ukwatta et al. GCN
Circ. 18522), from 106 s to 35.4 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 23 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 18526).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.08 (+/-0.06).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.30 (+0.31, -0.29). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.0 (+3.7, -3.0) x 10^21 cm^-2, at a
redshift of 1.423, in addition to the Galactic value of 3.4 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 2.9 x
10^-11 (3.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Galactic foreground: 3.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Intrinsic column:    3.0 (+3.7, -3.0) x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=1.423
Photon index:	     2.30 (+0.31, -0.29)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.08, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 8.0 x 10^-4 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.3 x
10^-14 (2.9 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
