E. Rol (U. of Leicester), N. Tanvir (U. of Hertfordshire), A. Levan
(U. of Leicester), A. Adamson, L. Fuhrman (JAC), R. Priddey,
R. Chapman (U. of Hertfordshire) report:

We have observed the error circle of GRB050505 (GCN 3360) in K-band
with the WFCAM instrument on UKIRT. At the position of the optical
candidate (GCN 3366), we clearly detect a point-like source,
presumably the infrared counterpart.
Relative to 2MASS stars in the frame we measure a provisional
magnitude of K = 18.1 +/- 0.2 (error includes allowance for possible
systematics), 6.82 hours after the burst trigger (mid-exposure time).
