K.L. Page, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

Using 3971 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 2 UVOT images for the 
INTEGRAL burst GRB 100103A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray 
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to 
the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 112.37270, -34.49020 which is equivalent 
to:

RA (J2000):  07 29 29.46
Dec (J2000): -34 29 24.9

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest 
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position 
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans 
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
