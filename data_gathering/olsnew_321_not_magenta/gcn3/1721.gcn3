M. Nysewander, J. Moran, L. Johnson, D. Moschler, and D. Reichart
(University of North Carolina) report:

We observed 100% of the small error box of the short burst GRB 021201 (GCN
1719) beginning at 8:15 UTC on December 3rd (2.1 days after the burst) with
the Morehead Observatory 0.6m telescope.  We integrated without filter for
~2700 seconds under relatively clear skies.

Visual comparison with the DSS-2 (R band) images reveal no new objects to
the limit of the DSS.
