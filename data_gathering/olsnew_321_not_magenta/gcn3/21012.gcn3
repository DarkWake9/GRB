report:

We imaged the field of the trigger 748858 detected by SWIFT
with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 4.25h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
18 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a two series of exposures:
t0+4.25h to t0+4.40h : Rlim = 20.1
t0+4.65h to t0+5.22h : Rlim = 20.3

No source exhibit a variation flux compatible with
a GRB afterglow. All sources detected by Zadko are
presents in the DR9 SDSS-III image.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
