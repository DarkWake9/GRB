Using the data set from T-239 to T+843 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140211A (trigger #586289)
(Cummngs, et al., GCN Circ. 1816).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 124.233, 20.237 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 16m 56.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +20d 14' 14.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 81%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single episode of emission starting
at ~T-30 sec, peaking at ~T=5 sec, and ending at ~T+135 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 89.4 +- 18.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-16.84 to T+107.96 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.10 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.90 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
