"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 050416 (GCN3264 ; Swift-BAT Trigger time is 11:04:57 UT)
with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope
at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 11:09:18 UT on Apr.16.
After co-adding a set of 5 images (11:09:18 - 11:14:52 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than
16.7 mag. at the reported position by S.Bradley Cenko et al.
(GCN3265) and J.A.Kennea et al.(GCN3268)."
