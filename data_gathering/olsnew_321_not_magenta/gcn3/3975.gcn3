Swift-BAT trigger 155072 (Greiner et al. GCN circ. 3974) appears to be
consistent with a statistical fluctuation in the intersection of the
rate and image domains.  We cannot completely rule out that the rate and
image excesses are due to a very weak GRB, based on the BAT data.

If the excesses are due to a very weak GRB, the burst would appear to be
short (~1 sec) and to have a hard spectrum with no emission < 50 keV in
the BAT energy range. The spectral parameters are poorly constrained.

The BAT refined ground analysis position is RA, Dec 59.512d, -16.655d
(3h 58m 2.8s, -16d 39' 19") J2000, with an error radius of 4 arcmin
(90% confidence including systematic errors).

The initial XRT image (a single 2.5 sec integration at 11:28:53.8 UT, 
99 sec after the BAT trigger) has no indication of an X-ray source.  
Further XRT observations in PC mode began at 12:35:30 (T+3996 sec).  In 
2.1 ks of PC mode data there is no detectable X-ray source.  The 3-sigma 
unabsorbed flux upper limit is 2.5e-13 erg cm^-2 sec^-1 (0.3-10 keV).  We 
note that this is highly unusual for a long GRB at this epoch, but does 
not rule out a short GRB.

UVOT began observing 4084 sec after the BAT trigger.  No new source
is seen in the 100 second exposure with the V filter to a 5-sigma limit
of 18.4 magnitudes.  This magnitude is uncorrected for extinction and is
based on a preliminary zero-point, measured in orbit, and will require
refinement with further calibration.

No further observations are planned.
