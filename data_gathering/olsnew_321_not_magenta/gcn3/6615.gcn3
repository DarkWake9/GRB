The short GRB 070707 (Beckmann et al., GCN 6605; Gotz et al., GCN 6607) 
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=58122.823 s UT (16:08:42.823).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows a multipeaked structure
with a total duration of ~1 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.41(-1.07, +0.16)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.016 s
8.1(-6.7, +2.9)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the most intense part of the burst
(from T0 to T0+0.256) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.57 (-0.59, +0.43)
and Ep = 427(-144, +374) keV (chi2 = 13/19 dof).
Thus, this burst is classified as a short hard GRB.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
