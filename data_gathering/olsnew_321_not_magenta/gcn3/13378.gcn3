of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short-duration hard intense GRB 120624A
(IPN localization: Golenetskii at al., GCN 13376)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=26662.982s UT (07:24:22.982)

The light curve shows a single pulse,
a total duration of the burst is ~0.3 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120624_T26662/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.3(-0.3,+0.3)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.048 s,
of 2.0(-0.3,+0.3)x10-4 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is well fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.70 (-0.1, +0.1),
and Ep = 3350(-460, +550) keV,
chi2 = 49.4/50 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
