TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5456
SUBJECT: GRB 060814: source inside revised XRT error box

D. Malesani (SISSA) reports on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

Following the revised position for the X-ray afterglow of GRB 060814 
(Moretti et al., GCN 5447, 5451), I have looked at the VLT images taken 
the last night (Malesani et al., GCN 5450).

On the edge of the XRT error box, there is a source. It is extended, or 
it may be the superposition of more than one source (the seeing was 
0.8"). The source is detected in both R and I images, and is not visible 
in the SDSS frames (Cool et al., GCN 5449). However, it is likely 
fainter than the SDSS limit. The "centroid" of the object has the 
following approximate coordinates:

alpha = 14:45:21.3
delta = +20:35:10.19

A finding chart is posted at the following URL:

At the moment, it is not clear whether the object is related to the GRB.
