report:

The 30 cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malargue (Argentina)
reacted robotically to the INTEGRAL/IBAS alert of GRB190919B
(Mereghetti et al., GCNC 25788), starting with a series of 20 s
unfiltered images at 23:47:16 UT, i.e. 36 s post trigger.

We clearly detect the optical afterglow reported by Bolmer (GCN
25789), Tyurina et al. (GCN 25791) and Pugliese et al. (GCN
25792) at single frames. The optical lightcurve seems to have
a multi-peak structure with maxima reaching r'(AB) ~ 16.5 mag,
and fades beyond the single-image detection limit of r' ~ 17.2 by
~ 10 minutes post trigger. A detailed analysis is ongoing.
