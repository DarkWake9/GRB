A. Gal-Yam and E. O. Ofek (Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the full error box of GRB 030320 (Mereghetti et al. 2003,
GCN 1341; Hurley et al. 2003, GCN 1943) using the Wise observatory 1m 
telescope + Tek CCD camera, starting March 21, 02:42 UT (16.9 hours after
the burst). Two 300 s R-band frames were obtained under poor conditions 
at high airmass. 
 
Comparison of the combined image with the POSS-II E plate
reveals no new optical sources, to a limiting magnitude of R=17.5,
within the IBIS error circle.
