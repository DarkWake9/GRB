TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1968
SUBJECT: GRB030323: Detection on 2003/03/24

W. M. Wood-Vasey (LBNL/UCB), P. A. Price (RSAA/ANU), and D. Fox
(Caltech), using images obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks,
and K. Lawrence (Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion
Laboratory), report that an image taken with the Palomar 1.2-m
telescope on 2003 Mar 24.27 UT shows the optical transient of Gilmore
et. al (GCN #1949) at a unfiltered magnitude of 18.83 +0.09-0.08.  Two
previous Mar 24 images taken under poor conditions do not show the OT:

---------------------------------------- 
2003 Mar 24.19   [ 16.59                 
2003 Mar 24.23   [ 16.26                 
2003 Mar 24.27     18.83  +0.09  -0.08   
 
Magnitudes are calibration against >300 USNO-A V1.0 R-band stars in
the 0.25 sq. degree field of the images.  We clarify here that the
limiting magnitudes quoted in GCN #1957 were calculated in the same
manner.
