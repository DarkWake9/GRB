Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081127 (trigger #335715)
(Mao, et al., GCN Circ. 8560).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 332.075, 6.858 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 08m 18.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 51' 30.2" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 51%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-30 sec,
peaking around T+0 sec, and ending at ~T+55 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 37 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-31.2 to T+8.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.10 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.9 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-1.19 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
