The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:41:27 UT on 9 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200809B (trigger 618680492.129862 / 200809654).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 359.8, Dec = -76.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 59m, -76d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 116.0 degrees.
