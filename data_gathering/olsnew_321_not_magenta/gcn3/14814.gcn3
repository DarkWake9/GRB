T. A. Pritchard (PSU) and T. N. Ukwatta (MSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 130606A
84 s after the BAT trigger (Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 14781).
No optical afterglow consistent with the optical position
(Xu et al., GCN Circ 15783) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Aspect correction was lost in a number of sub-exposures resulting in
image streaks, rough aspect corrections and larger apertures have been
used to calibrate the field, although with a lower sensitivity.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
