report on behalf of the MAXI team:

We examined the MAXI/GSC all-sky X-ray images (2-20 keV) obtained
in the orbits following LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 and the Fermi GBM trigger
524666471/170817.529 at 2017-08-17 12:41:06.47 UTC (GCN 21506).

At the trigger time of Fermi GBM, the high-voltage of MAXI/GSC was off,
and it was turned on at T0+173 sec.
The center of the Fermi GBM localization was located near the pole of
ISS orbital rotation, where the MAXI/GSC cannot cover the field.
The field of candidate optical counterpart (GCN 21529) was marginally
covered by MAXI and  was scanned at 12:23 UT (18 min before the trigger),
but the OT position was obscured by an ISS structure.

The OT candidate position was difficult to cover with MAXI/GSC due to
unfavorable orientation of the orbital plane of the ISS, and therefore
it was not observed for the following 8 orbits.
The first scan by MAXI/GSC was started at 08-18 02:19 UTC (818 min
after the LIGO trigger).
We did not detect a significant source at this position with a 3-sigma
upper limit of
54 mCrab.  This limit is higher than the typical value because of high
particle background flux.

For the remaining area of the G298048 preliminary-LALInference skymap,
we obtained a typical 1(3)-sigma upper limit of
11(33) mCrab in the orbit following the trigger.

If you require information of X-ray flux by MAXI/GSC at specific coordinates,
