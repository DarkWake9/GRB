J.P.U. Fynbo, D. Malesani, C.C. Thoene (NBI-DARK), P.M. Vreeswijk (ESO), 
J. Hjorth (NBI-DARK), C. Henriksen (NOT and DARK), report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 061110B (Fox et al., GCN 5800, Melandri 
et al., GCN 5804) with the ESO-VLT UT2 equipped with FORS1. Observations 
started on 2006 Nov 11.018 UT (2.45 hr after the GRB), and two spectra 
lasting 30 minutes each were acquired with the grism 300V.

 From the analysis of the first spectrum, we clearly see a strong DLA 
through at lambda ~ 5390 AA. From this feature, as well from OI+SiII, 
CII and SiIV, we measure a redshift of z = 3.44.

We acknowledge kind assistance from the ESO staff, in particular Stan 
Stefl and Chris Lidman.
