A. Stefanescu, F. Schrey, S. Duscha, M. Muehlegger, N. Primak,
G. Kanbach, H. Steinle (MPE Garching) of the OPTIMA-Burst Team report 
the following:

"OPTIMA-Burst at the 1.3m Skinakas Observatory, of the University of
Crete, Greece observed the Swift XRT-errorcircle of GRB 060912 (GCN 
Circ. 5558, C.P. Hurkett et al.) starting at 19:21UT (~5.5h after the 
Burst).

We detect a source consistent with the source reported by C.P. Hurkett 
et al. and M. Zhai et al. (GCN Circ. 5560). We estimate the magnitude of 
the source as R=21.6 +- 0.2

There is no known minor planet brighter than 23 mag within 5' of the 
source according to MPChecker"
