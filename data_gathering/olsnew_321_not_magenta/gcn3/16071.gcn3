At 00:10:06 Swift-BAT triggered on GRB 140402A(trigger # 594308), also seen by
FERMI-LAT (Bissaldi et al. GCN Circ #16069) and Fermi-GBM (Jenke & Yu, GCN Circ
#16070) .  There is a marginal BAT source (6 sigma), which is consistent with
the Fermi-LAT position, at RA, Dec 207.651, +6.006, which is:

RA (J2000) 13h 50m 36.2s
Dec (J2000) 06d 00m 22s

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin.  The partial coding was
73% (i.e. all of the Fermi-LAT error circle was in a fairly highly coded part
of BAT's field of view).  This burst appears to have a very hard spectrum.
We may be able to improve the detection when we receive the photon event data.

The unweighted lightcurve shows a single peak of about 0.32 seconds duration.

A previous Swift TOO at the Fermi-LAT position did not cover this position.
A new TOO has been requested.
