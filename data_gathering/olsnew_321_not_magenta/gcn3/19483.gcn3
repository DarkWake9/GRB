E. Mazaeva (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI),   I. Korobtsev

collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift  GRB 160601A (Kocevski et al., GCN 
19478) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy)  starting on 
June, 01 (UT) 15:00:41.  We obtained several images in R-filter under 
good weather conditions and FWHM of 1.5 arcsec. Using only part of 
images available we marginally detect (S/N ~2) a source at the edge of 
Swift-XRT position (Kocevski et al., GCN  19478).   Coordinates of the 
source are (J2000) 15:39:44.43 +64:32:19.3 with uncertainty of 1 arcsec. 
Preliminary photometry  of  the source is R~22.3, and details of 
observations are   following

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars, Lupton transformations into R:

We will update the results after all the data will be available.
