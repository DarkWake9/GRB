We have acquired 5x480s R-band images of GRB 031220 (HETE trigger
#2976) field with the CTIO 4-m Telescope (+Mosaic2) on 2003 Dec.
21.1787--21.2113 UT. The large field of view of Mosaic2 allowed
us to simultaneously image the positions of the 7 X-ray sources
detected by Chandra (GCN #2502).

Fixing our zero point to the R-band magnitude of source #27 (based
on the R-band images taken with the TNG, GCN #2503) we obtain the
following magnitudes:

Sources #6, #17 and #27, remain constant within photometric
uncertainties. No comparison was possible for objects #1, #2 and
#37, which are not present in the TNG images. Object #7 shows an
R-band decay at a 3.8 sigma level, which makes it a suggestive
afterglow candidate.

However, the potential fading associated with object #7 would
yield a power-law decay index Alpha = 0.21 +/-  0.05, quite
unusual (but not unprecedented) for GRB afterglows.

We encourage further deep R-band imaging to clarify the potential
fading of source #7
