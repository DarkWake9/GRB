J. P. Halpern, N. Mirabal, E. V. Gotthelf (Columbia), & J. Kemp
(Joint Astronomy Centre/Columbia) report on behalf of the MDM
Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"R-band images of this field taken on three nights and previously
described in GCNs #1186 and #1187 also cover the positions of the
two radio sources described by Frail (GCN #1207).  Optical images
of both sources are shown on the web page given below.  Neither
show evidence of variability.  The point radio source corresponding
to CXOU J030532.4+034301 is approximately equidistant (3") from 
three optical objects. It is not clear which, if any, is the
counterpart.

Examination of the I-band images obtained on the MDM 1.3m on
Dec. 2.30 UT (GCN #1177) under bright lunar conditions shows
marginal detections of the two brightest Chandra sources on
the list of Ricker et al. (GCN #1185), CXOU J030527.9+034657
and CXOU J030532.5+035140. The combined I-band image is slightly
deeper than the POSS-II IVN plate, but does not provide any
evidence for variability of the detected objects.  In addition,
we note that examination of blue and red POSS II plates shows
blue objects at the locations of CXOU J030532.5+035140 and
CXOU J030534.3+034958.
