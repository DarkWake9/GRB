D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), Y.-D. Hu (IAA-CSIC), Y. Qing (Geneva Observatory), 
Y.-H. Han (NAOC/CAS, HUST), C.-M. Zhang, S.-M. Hu, C. Cao (SDU) report:

We observed the field of GRB 160314A (D'Elia et al., GCN 19182) using 
the 1-m telescope located at Weihai, Shandong, China. Observations 
started at 11:51:15 UT on 2016-03-14 (i.e., 18.4 min after the burst) in 
cloudy weather, and 4x300s R-band frames were obtained.

No optical source is detected within the XRT error circle (D'Elia et 
al., GCN 19182), down to a limiting magnitude of m(R)~19.0, calibrated 
with the SDSS field.
