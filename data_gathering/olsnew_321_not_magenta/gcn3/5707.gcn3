At 10:08:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061007 (trigger=232683).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 46.318, -50.488 {03h 05m 16s, -50d 29' 15"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 100 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~25000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~54 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 10:09:29 UT, 80 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) = 03h 05m 19.5s, Dec(J2000) = -50d 30' 02.1",
with an estimated uncertainty of 7.5 arcseconds (90% confidence
radius). This location is 55 arcseconds from the BAT on-board
position, within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 0.1s
image was 3.4e-08 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 400 seconds with the V filter
starting 195 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a very bright
source in the 2.7' x 2.7' sub-image not present in DSS at RA(J2000) =
03:05:19.51 = 46.3313 DEC(J2000) = -50:30:02.5 = -50.5007 with a
1-sigma error radius of about 0.5 arc sec. This position is 0.7 arc
sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude
is 12.8 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.5 mag. No correction has been
made for the expected extinction of about 0.1 magnitudes.
