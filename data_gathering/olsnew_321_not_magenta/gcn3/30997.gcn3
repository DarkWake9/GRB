Using the data set from T-239 to T+844 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 211025A (trigger #1081113)
(Gropp, et al., GCN Circ. 30986).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 162.407, 31.506 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  10h 49m 37.8s 
  Dec(J2000) = +31d 30' 20.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single broad pulse beginning at T+0,
peaking around T+50 sec and declining to background by T+150 sec. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is 103.5 +- 27.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+12.32 to T+128.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.96 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.7 +- 1.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+51.66 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
