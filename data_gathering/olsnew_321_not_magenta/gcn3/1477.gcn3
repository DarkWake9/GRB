Spectropolarimetry of GRB 020813

A. J. Barth (Caltech), M. H. Cohen (Caltech), R. W. Goodrich (Keck), P.A.
Price (RASAA, ANU), J. S. Bloom (Harvard/CfA, Caltech), and D. W. Fox
(Caltech) report:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 020813 (Fox, Blake, & Price, GCN
#1470) with the dual-beam LRIS spectropolarimeter on the Keck I 10 m
telescope. GCN #1475 discusses absorption features seen in these data. A
preliminary reduction of one hour of polarization data reveals significant
linear polarization of 3.0% +/- 0.1% at a p.a. of 166 +/- 1 degrees from
3500-5500 Ang., and 2.8% +/- 0.1% at p.a. 158 +/- 1 degrees from 6000-9000
Ang.  The fractional polarization is effectively flat and featureless with
wavelength and the polarization angle exhibits a slight decrease towards
the red.
