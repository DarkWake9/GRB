 BEPPOSAX GRBM Localization of GRB991226
 
 B. Preger and F. Frontera, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, 
 K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline, on 
 behalf of the NEAR GRB team, report:
 
 The BeppoSAX GRBM data for GRB 991226, for which two possible
 ~70 sq. arcmin. error boxes were reported (Hurley, Feroci and 
 Cline, GCN #509), were used to derive a rough independent 
 localization of the GRB source. On the basis of that analysis 
 the following intersection derived from the IPN has the highest 
 probability to be the correct one:
 
        RA(2000)        DEC(2000)          
 14 h 38 m 50.18 s    -61 o 26 '   9.81 "    
 14 h 38 m 17.77 s    -61 o 41 '  15.52 "    
 14 h 38 m 36.73 s    -61 o 14 '  11.84 "    
 14 h 38 m  4.71 s    -61 o 29 '  22.01 "
