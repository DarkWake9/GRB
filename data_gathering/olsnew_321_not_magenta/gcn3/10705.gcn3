We began to observe GRB100423A (Stroh et al., GCN 10651;
Filgas et al., GCN 10652; Ivarsen et al., GCN 10653) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at 14:33:45(UT). The moon 
light was very bright. A series of R band images was 
obtained. No new source was found in the XRT errorbars 
within the combined 6*300s R band image. The 3 sigma upper 
limit is about 19.5 mag derived from USNO-B1.0,at the mean 
time of 14.2 hour after the burst.
