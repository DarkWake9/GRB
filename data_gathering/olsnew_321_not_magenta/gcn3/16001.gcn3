G. Younes (USRA/MSFC) and V. Connaughton (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:12:46.11 UT on 19 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
Triggered and located GRB 140320A (trigger 416974369/140320092), which
was  also detected by Swift (Cannizzo et al. 2014, GCN 16000).

The double peaked structure seen with BAT, with ~150 s separation, and
reported by Cannizzo et al. is also visible with FERMI/GBM, however, a
location analysis with GBM shows that the two peaks are unrelated. The
first peak (trigger peak) is most likely due to a short/hard GRB located at
RA~284.6 DEC~-5.0 deg, consistent with the BAT location. The second peak,
150 s after the trigger, is much softer and locates at RA~265.0 DEC~-28.0,
the location of the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28, which is currently active.

Hence, we encourage multi-wavelength follow-up observations of this candidate short/hard GRB.”
