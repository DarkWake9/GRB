The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:42:52 UT on 1 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211201A (trigger 660084177.881018 / 211201863).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 355.4, Dec = 2.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 41m, 2d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
