G. Stratta, M. Perri, M. L. Conciatore (ASDC), D. N. Burrows (PSU) and
G. Sato (GSFC/ISAS) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

We have analysed the first 12 orbits of Swift XRT data on the BAT GRB
070209 (Sato et al., GCN Circ. 6086). Data in Photon Counting mode
started at 03:35:10 UT, 89 s after the BAT trigger. With an exposure time
of 26.9 ks we did not find X-ray sources within the BAT refined error
circle (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 6087). We note that the following
X-ray sources are detected in the 0.7-10 keV band in the proximity of the
BAT error circle:

Source #1: CR = (1.1+/-0.3)e-3 cts/s RA/Dec(J2000)=03 04 57.3 -47 19 35.6
Source #2: CR = (7.5+/-2.2)e-4 cts/s RA/Dec(J2000)=03 05 04.9 -47 18 42.8
Source #3: CR = (1.4+/-0.3)e-3 cts/s RA/Dec(J2000)=03 04 39.1 -47 27 57.3

The estimated uncertainty of the positions of the three sources is about
5 arcsec (90% containment).

Source #1 lies 3.1 arcmin from the refined BAT position, just outside the
error circle. We note that this source may be fading, but due to the small
number of counts we are unable to determine clearly if the source is
decaying. A Swift follow-up observation will be performed in a few days to
confirm whether source #1 is fading or not.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
