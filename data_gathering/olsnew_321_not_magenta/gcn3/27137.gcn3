report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 07:36:49.10 UT on 19 February 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200219A (trigger 603790614/200219317),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Lien et al. 2020, GCN 27125).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 49 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 1.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.448 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.60 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1.4 +/- 0.2 MeV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.8 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.192 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 16.1 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
