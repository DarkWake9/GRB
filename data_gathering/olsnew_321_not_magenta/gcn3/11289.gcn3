Using the data set from T-240 to T+960 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100917A (trigger
#434360) (Littlejohns, et al., GCN Circ. 11288).  The BAT ground-
calculated position is RA, Dec = 289.250, -17.120 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  19h 17m 00.1s
    Dec(J2000) = -17d 07' 12.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 62%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like profile with rise time
of ~5 sec and decay time of ~30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 66 +- 22 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.1 to T+76 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.67 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.6 +-
1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.22
sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
