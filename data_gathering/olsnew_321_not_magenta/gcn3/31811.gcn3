The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 10:17:40.89 UT on 1 April 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 220401A (trigger  670501065/
220401429). The trigger was initially classified as a Solar flare but
it is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 8.0, Dec = 50.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 0h 3m, 50d
00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 82.0 degrees.
