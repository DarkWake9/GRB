Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170607A (trigger #756284)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 21214).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 7.358, 9.225 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  00h 29m 26.0s
  Dec(J2000) = +09d 13' 30.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.

The mask-weighted light curve show two prominent pulses. The first pulse
starts before it came into the BAT FOV at T0-217.9 s during a preplanned
spacecraft slew. It peaks at ~T0-210 s and ends at ~T0-190 s. The second
pulse starts at ~T0-10 s, peaks at T0, and ends at ~T0+40 s, with a tail
lasting till ~T0+140 s.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-207.896 to T0+144.104 s is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.61 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.5 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
