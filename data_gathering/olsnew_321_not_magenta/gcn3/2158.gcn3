report:


The error box of GRB030418 (HETE 2679) was
observed with MASTER system (280mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru). We
obtained 20 measurements in R filter. Our observations started at Apr 18,
21:00 UT (11 hours after the GRB) and  had been lasting for 2.5 hours
up to Apr 18   22:36 UT (12,5 hours after  the  GRB).

There is no OT brighter than 16.5  (R-band) in error box. Transparency was
quite poor due to low altitude of the field above the horizont.

Our  fits-images are available at:
