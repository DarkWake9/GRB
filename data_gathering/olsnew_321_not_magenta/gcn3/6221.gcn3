E.  Rol,  N. Tanvir (Leicester), N.  Mirabal  (Columbia), K.  Wiersema
(Amsterdam),  J.P.   Halpern   (Columbia),  A.   Levan  (Warwick),  R.
Chapman (Hertfordshire), A.  Melandri (Liverpool JMU) and D.  Pinfield
(Hertfordshire), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We  re-observed  the position  of  the  X-ray  afterglow of  GRB070223
(Vetere  et al,  GCN report  35.1) with  the LIRIS  instrument  on the
William  Herschel Telescope,  between  7.99 and  8.08  days after  the
burst. Our J  and K images do  not show any source inside  the XRT 90%
error  circle. As our  observations are  considerably deeper  than the
first epoch  LIRIS observations reported by Castro-Tirado  et al (GCNC
6168; private  communication), we conclude the source  reported is the
nIR afterglow of GRB070223.

We also  re-examined the optical  images taken with the  MDM telescope
(Mirabal et  al., GCNC 6162), and  find a faint optical  source at the
position of  the nIR afterglow. We  point out that this is a different
source than the one located at RA (J2000) = 10 13 48.19, Dec (J2000) =
43 07 54.7  (S1, GCNC 6162), which now also  falls outside the revised
XRT position (Vetere et al.).

We derive a position for the optical afterglow of (J2000):

   RA  =  10 13 48.39
   Dec = +43 08 00.7

which   fully   agrees   with   the   X-ray   position   (GCN   report
35.1).  Astrometry was done  relative to  the SDSS  (Cool et  al, GCNC
6128), and errors are about 0.3 arcsecond in each coordinate.
