SUBJECT: GRB 070612A: Possible WSRT Radio Detection
DATE:    07/06/17 10:46:54 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst, R.A.M.J. Wijers, K. Wiersema (University of Amsterdam),
and E. Rol (University of Leicester) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 070612A afterglow (GCN 6509) at 4.9 GHz
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at June 15 8.10 UT to 20.09 UT,
i.e. 3.23 - 3.73 days after the burst.
We tentatively detect a radio source at 3 sigma significance, located at the
position of the optical counterpart (GCN 6515, GCN 6525), with a flux of
78 +/- 25 microJy.
Further observations at radio wavelengths of this afterglow are planned and
encouraged, especially given the suggested association with a nearby
low-redshift host galaxy (GCN 6525).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
