report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:19:15.62 UT on 14 July 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160714A (trigger 490155559/160714097),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Siegel et al. 2016, GCN 19697)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 51 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a short pulse with sub-structures
with a duration (T90) of about 0.32 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.5 +/- 0.4 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 200 +/- 55 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.6 +/- 0.3)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.128 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 6 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
