A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) reports on behalf of a large
collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 090323 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at March 27 17.92 UT to March 28
5.91 UT, i.e. 4.74 - 5.24 days after the burst (GCN 8980).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 105 +/- 24 microJy
at the position of the optical counterpart (GCN 9021).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
