C. Guidorzi, P. Romano (Univ Bicocca&INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the
Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 061019 (trigger #234516, Guidorzi et
al., GCN Circ. 5728) at 05:05:46.60 UT, 46.7 minutes after the BAT trigger.
Analysis of the initial TDRSS downliked data reveals a faint and
uncataloged source at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 06h06m31.05s
Dec(J2000) = +29:34:10.17

with an estimated uncertainty of 8.2 arcseconds (90% containment).
This position lies 41 arcseconds from the center of the BAT error circle
reported in GCN Circ 5728.

Due to the small number of counts, we are unable to determine whether
the source is decaying at this time. However, observations are being
performed and will become available after the Malindi gap
(which ends at 07:21 UT).

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
