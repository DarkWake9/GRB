Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the SWIFT-XRT X-ray afterglow position of the GRB 080229b
(GCN 7354) at 4.8 and 8.456 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) on May 31, 2008 between 04:39:45 UT and 12:09:05 UT.

We did not detect a radio source at the XRT position of the GRB 080229b
afterglow (GCN 7354). The radio flux density at the GRB X-ray afterglow
position is -0.704 +/- 0.422 mJy at 4.8 GHz, and -0.012 +/- 0.255 mJy at
8.6 GHz (1-sigma).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
