In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190814bv at T0 = 2019-08-14
21:10:39(UT),
a preliminary analysis of the AGILE data at T0 shows that the
Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered ~100% of the 90% c.l.
localization region (LR), observed at off-axis angles above 60 deg.

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10
GeV on T0,
when good exposure of the S190814bv 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

(T0-2s; T0+2s): from 2.1e-06 to 4.0e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

(T0; T0+5s): from 2.0e-06 to 5.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

(T0; T0+10s); from 1.1e-06 to 5.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1;

(T0; T0+100s); from 5.7e-07 to 5.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1.


These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
