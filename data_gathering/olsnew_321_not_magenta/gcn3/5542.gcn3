I. Bruni (Bologna Observatory), F. Strafella(University of Lecce
and INFN, Lecce) and G. Pizzichini (INAF/IASF Bologna) report:

Using the 152 cm Loiano telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera
system, in poor sky conditions (full moon, seeing = 1.8"), we
obtained one Rc-band image (1 x 900 sec) of the field of
GRB060906 (Racusin et al., GCN 5540), starting on September 6.962 .
At a 3-sigma level the OT reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 5529) is not
detected  in our frame, which is  slightly deeper than Rc=20.3.
We used NOMAD1 as our reference catalog.
