A. Monfardini, A. Gomboc, C. Guidorzi, C.G. Mundell, R.J. Smith,
I. A. Steele, C.J. Mottram, D. Carter, M.F. Bode (Liverpool JMU) report:

"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope followed up robotically the GRB050713
detected by SWIFT (GCN 3581). Three prompt images (2-4 minutes) have 
been acquired. No later time observations have been acquired.
We clearly detect the first object suggested by Malesani (GCN 3582) at:

RA = 21:22:09.6,  DEC = +77:04:29 (1 arcsec error)

At a mean epoch of 3 minutes after the reported GRB time we preliminarly
estimate a magnitude of r'=19.2 with large errors due to comparison
with USNOB1.0 and magnitude conversion. Further analysis is ongoing. 
The afterglow is detected on individual images.

This message can be cited."
