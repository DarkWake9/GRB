The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S190521g during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-05-21
03:02:29.447 UTC (GPS time: 1242442967.447). The candidate was found
by the PyCBC Live [1], CWB [2], GstLAL [3], and SPIIR [4] analysis
pipelines.

S190521g is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 3.8e-09 Hz, or about one in 8
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190521g

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (97%), Terrestrial (3%), BNS (<1%), NSBH (<1%),
or MassGap (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong
evidence against the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar
masses (HasNS: <1%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the
signal, there is strong evidence against matter outside the final
compact object (HasRemnant: <1%).

One sky map is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by
   BAYESTAR [5], distributed via GCN notice about 6 minutes after
   the candidate

For the bayestar.fits.gz sky map, the 90% credible region is 1163 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 663 +/- 156 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

We have reason to believe that the distance may be underestimated
because different search pipelines have reported a range of distances.
The two-dimensional sky map (right ascension and declination)
is in good agreement across pipelines. Offline analyses to resolve
this issue are ongoing.
