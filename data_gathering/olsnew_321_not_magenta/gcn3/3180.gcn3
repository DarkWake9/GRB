  At 15:58:48.40 UT Swift-BAT triggered on burst GRB 050406 (trigger 
113872).
The BAT-derived position is RA,Dec= 34.428, -50.178 (J2000). 
Significant emission
has been detected for at least 3 sec with possible low significance 
peaks over
an additional 30 sec.  The peak count rate was 800 cnts/sec. The source 
was
detected at 15 degrees off the bore-site and thus is in the fully-coded 
field-of-view.

Swift slewed promptly and the UVOT imaged the field at the end of the 
slew and did
not find a bright optical source in the 8 arcmin square binned field of 
view centered
on the BAT position.

The XRT also imaged the field promptly and did not find a bright X-ray 
source within
the field of view.  Based on previous experience, this lack of prompt 
x-ray afterglow
suggests either that this trigger is not a GRB, or that it is a very 
interesting and
unusual GRB.  The BAT rate trigger and image are significant enough to 
lean
toward an interpretation of an unusual GRB.
