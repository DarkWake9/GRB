" We have observed the XRT error region of GRB 050412 (Tamburelli et
al. GCN 3241) using 0.8-m telescope at XingLong Observatory,
China. Eight R-band images with each 300 exposure times are taken from
15.93 UT to 16.55 UT (~ 10.20 hrs to 10.82 hrs after the burst).
Coadding the eight images yields the 3-sigma limiting magnitude of
R~20, which was calibrated relative to USNO-B1.0 catalog.  No new
source was detected in our images.  There is no optical emission from
the optical candidate reported by Fox et al. (GCCN 3244) down to the
limiting magnitude."
