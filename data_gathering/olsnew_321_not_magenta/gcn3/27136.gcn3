behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200219ac at T0 = 2020-02-19
09:44:15.195 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no significant event candidates within a time
interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 60% of the S200219ac 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S200219ac localization
region, from a minimum of 1.6E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.2E-06 erg
cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

An independent procedure based on photon counting statistics provides UL
fluences in the range 0.4-1 MeV, for a 300 Âµs integration time, from a
minimum of 1.4E-8 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 4.4E-8 erg cm^-2.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
