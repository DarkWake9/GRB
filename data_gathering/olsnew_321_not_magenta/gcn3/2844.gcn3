SUBJECT: GRB041211, BVRcIc field calibration

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 11x11 arcmin field centered on the SXC coordinates for the
HETE burst GRB041211 (trigger 3622; Dezalay et al., GCN 2839)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric
night.  Stars brighter than V=13.5 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb041211.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
The estimated external photometric error is about 0.02mag
and will be improved with additional calibration nights
if an afterglow is found.

As always, you should check the dates on the .dat file prior to
final publication to get the latest photometry.  There is
a README file on the ftp directory to give you information
about the procedures used to calibrate these fields.
