report on behalf of the Swift-BAT and Swift-XRT teams:

At 09:31:18.44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB 050319.  The burst was 37 degrees off the BAT 
boresight.  The spacecraft executed an immediate slew and was on 
target by 09:32:45.53 UT at which time the XRT began taking data in 
Auto State.  On-board software recognized a bright source at location

RA 154.2016d {+10h 16m 48s} (J2000),
Dec  +43.5463d {+43d 32' 47"} (J2000)

We estimate an uncertainty of 7 arcseconds.

The burst lightcurve as seen in the BAT has a single peak with a fast 
rise, exponential decay.  The estimated duration is 15 seconds.  The 
peak count rate is 2,000 counts/second (15-350 KeV)
