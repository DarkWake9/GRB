Derek B. Fox (Caltech) reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie
GRB collaboration:  

"We have observed the WXM localization region of GRB050123 (=H3666;
Hurley et al., GCN 2966) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope,
in a series of R-band exposures beginning at 10:36:15 UT.  A mosaic of
our first exposure set reaches exposures of 30s to 120s over >95% of
the final 15' x 24' error box, at a mean epoch of 11:02 UT.
Comparison of this mosaic to the Digitized Sky Survey reveals no new
sources to a limit of R>~19 mag.

Further analysis of these and later images is ongoing."
