We observed the location of the Swift/UVOT transient (Breeveld et al.,
GCN Circ. 24296) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
AstronÃ³mico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Martir from 2019/04 28.28 to
2019/04 28.49 UTC (approximately 3 d after the GW trigger), obtaining
a total of 1.92 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 1.21 hours
exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the UVOT error circle, in comparison with the
USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  g > 23.5
  r > 23.4
  i > 23.3
  Z > 22.2
  Y > 22.2
  J > 21.8
  H > 21.4

The nearby objected reported by Palmese et al. (GCN Circ. 24312) is
detected in our images at H~20.1 mag.

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
