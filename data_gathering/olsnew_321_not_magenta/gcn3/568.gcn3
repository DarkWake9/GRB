GRB000301C

D. A. Smith (MIT) reports on behalf of the ASM team at MIT and
NASA/GSFC, and K. Hurley (UCB) and T. Cline (NASA/GSFC) report on
behalf of the Ulysses and NEAR GRB teams:

The ASM has detected a GRB at 03/01/2000 09:51:37 (UTC).  The burst
showed a single peak with a simple fast-rise, slow-decay structure.
The three ASM energy channels showed the strongest response in the
5-12 keV band, reaching a peak flux of 3.7+-0.7 Crab (5-12 keV) in 1-s
time bins.  The event lasted approximately 10 seconds.  The event was
detected by a single ASM SSC, yielding an error box (90% confidence,
including systematic and statistical error) 4.2 degrees long and 8.7
arcminutes wide, centered at R.A. = 16h 13m 14s and Decl. = 28o 37'
59.2" (J2000.0), with a position angle of -117.1 degrees.

Ulysses and NEAR observed this burst.  Preliminary triangulation gives
an annulus 5' in full-width (3 sigma), centered at R.A. = 20h 34m
7.56s and Decl. = 20o 32' 19.62s (J2000.0), with a central radius of
57.520 degrees.  This annulus may be refined.

This annulus intersects the ASM error box at near-right angles to
create a composite localization of a parallelogram of area ~50
sq. arcmin with the following corners (J2000.0):

R.A.	      Decl.
16h 20m 30s   +29o 30' 14.3"
16h 20m 08s   +29o 27' 50.4"
16h 20m 13s   +29o 19' 40.8"
16h 20m 35s   +29o 22' 00.0"
