J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P. Wozniak, and H. Davis,
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

A RAPTOR wide-field monitor located in Maui observed the location
of Swift trigger 530267 (Marshall et al., GCN 13602) during the period
that the Swift BAT was observing gamma-ray emission.  The 10 s exposure
began at 07:09:38.7 UTC -- 1 s after the Swift trigger and 1 s before
the gamma-ray emission reached peak intensity.  We detect no new object
at the location of the refined Swift XRT location (Beardmore et al., GCN
13603) to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of 10.3.  Our unfiltered images
are calibrated to the Tycho-2 V-band.
