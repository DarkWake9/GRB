N.P.M. Kuin (UCL/MSSL) and P.A. Evans (Leicester U)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 190610A
292282 s after the BAT trigger (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 24775).
No optical afterglow consistent with the BAT position or the XRT
candidate position (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. No. 24833) has been
detected in the initial UVOT exposures.  Preliminary 3-sigma upper
limits using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011,
AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the initial exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag

v               292282       300459         4890         >20.3

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.09 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
