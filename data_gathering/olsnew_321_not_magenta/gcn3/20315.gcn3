C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi, I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Gomboc 
(U. Nova Gorica), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath) on behalf of a large 
collaboration report:

We observed Swift GRB 161220A (D'Elia et al. GCN 20302) on December 20, 
from 11:02 to 11:13 UT (2.5-2.7 hours since the GRB) with the 2-m LCO 
Faulkes Telescope South in Siding Springs with the SDSS i filter under 
poor sky transparency conditions. Within the XRT error circle we do not 
find any object brighter than i~20 mag (total exposure of 5x120s) as 
calibrated against nearby USNOB1 stars.
