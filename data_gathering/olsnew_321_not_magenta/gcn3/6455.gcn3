T. Minezaki (IoA, Tokyo) and P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 070520B with the MAGNUM telescope + MIPS
dual-beam imager in R and J bands, at a mean observation time of 12.69
hours after the BAT trigger (GCN #6425).  We have only inspected the
J-band images, since other reports have covered the optical (GCN
##6442,6447).  We find no afterglow within the XRT error circle to a
limit of J = 20.1 mag.
