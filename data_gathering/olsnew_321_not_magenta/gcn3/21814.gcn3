K. P. Mooley (Hintze Fellow, Oxford), G. Hallinan (Caltech) and A. Corsi
(TTU) report on behalf of the JAGWAR and GROWTH teams

We observed the location of SSS17a in S band (2-4 GHz) as part of the
Jansky Array mapping of GW bursts as Afterglows in Radio (JAGWAR)
program on 01-02 Sep 2017 for 5 hours. We report the detection of a
source with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~5, consistent within the
astrometric uncertainty of the optical transient (Coulter et al. 2017,
LVC GCN 21529). We have confirmed this source through comparison with
contemporaneous C band observations reported by Corsi et al. (see
companion LVC GCN). Multifrequency monitoring of this source with the
VLA and other radio facilities has been initiated.

We thank the VLA staff for scheduling these observations.
