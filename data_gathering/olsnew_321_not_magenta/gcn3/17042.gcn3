Myungshin Im, Yongjung Kim, Minhee Hyun (CEOU/SNU),
Woojin Park, and Soojong Pak (Kyunghee Univ.)

We observed the field of GRB 141109A (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 17037),
using CQEUAN (Park et al. 2012) on the 2.1-m Otto-Struve telescope
at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, US. The observation started
at 2014-11-09 10:47:05 UT, or about 5 hrs after the BAT alert.
A series of images were taken with medium-band filters centered at
0.875, 0.925, 0.975, and 1.025 micron.

We identify the optical/NIR counterpart reported in Covino et al.
(GCN 17039), Xu et al. (GCN 17040), and Graham et al. (GCN 17041),
in all of the medium-band images. A preliminary magnitude
at 0.875 micron is 20.2 +- 0.1 AB mag. Further analysis of the data
is ongoing.
