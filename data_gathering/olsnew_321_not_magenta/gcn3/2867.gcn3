NUMBER:  2867
SUBJECT: GRB041219: P60 Optical Observations
DATE:    04/12/19 03:55:23 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. Bradley Cenko reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

"We have imaged the 2.5-arcmin radius error circle of the Integral GRB
041219 with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted
of 19 x 120-second exposures in the Kron I filter, commencing at 02:05:09
UT (~ 22 minutes after the burst).  To a limiting magnitude of I ~ 20 we
detect no new objects by reference to the Digitized Sky Survey (second
epoch).

Continued analysis and further observations are planned."
