A. N. Morgan, B. E. Cobb, S. B. Cenko,  J. S. Bloom, (UC Berkeley), report:

We observed the field of the possible GRB 090705 (Ukwatta et al., GCN
9615) with the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona.
Observations began at 2009-07-05 05:44:53 UT, ~33 minutes after the
Swift trigger.  In preliminary mosaics (effective exposure time of
~450 seconds) taken simultaneously in the J, H, and Ks filters, we
detect no new sources inside the BAT error circle down to the 2MASS
limits.
