We observed the field of GRB 150203A (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 17377) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/02 3.19 to 2015/02 3.26 UTC (0.50 to 2.14
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.28 hours exposure in
the r, i, and z bands.

We find no uncatalogued sources within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans,
et al., GCN 17378).  In comparison with USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we obtain the
following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 23.1
  i > 23.3
  z > 20.1

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
