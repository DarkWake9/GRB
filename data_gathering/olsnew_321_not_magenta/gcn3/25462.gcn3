The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:46:37 UT on 24 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190824A (trigger 588350802.674684 / 190824616).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 208.1, Dec = -39.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 52m, -39d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
