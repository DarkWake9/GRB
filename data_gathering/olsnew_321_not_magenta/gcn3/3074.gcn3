We observed error box of Swift  trigger 107518  with 1.5m telescope of
Mt.Maidanak high-altitude observatory. R-band images (4 x 180 s exposures)
were taken between (UT) 21:28 and 21:42 March 5, i.e. 46 minutes after
trigger and before ground analysis retraction of the trigger 107518 as GRB.
In comparison with DSS2 (red plate) no new source down to R~20 was found in
a stacked image within  error box. The limiting magnitude of the stacked
image is R~22.0.
