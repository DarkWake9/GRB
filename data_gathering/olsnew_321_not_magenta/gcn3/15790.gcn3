A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:36:12.84 UT on 06 February 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140206B (trigger 413361375 / 140206275).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is RA =
314.6, 
DEC = -6.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 20 h 58 m, -6 d 36 '), 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
that was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. 
The initial angle from the LAT boresight was 46 deg from the Fermi/GBM
position.

The GBM light curve is multi-peaked with a duration (T90) of about 120 s
(50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum  from T0+0.003 s to T0+44.993 s is well fit by a
Band function 
with Epeak = 296.6 +/- 7.3 keV, alpha = -0.97 +/-0.01 and beta = -2.14
+/-0.03
 
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(0.993 +/- 0.005)E-04 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+13.44 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 42.4 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
