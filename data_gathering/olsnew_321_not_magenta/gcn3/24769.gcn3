The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:12:18 UT on 8 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190608A (trigger 581645543.394168 / 190608009).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 225.7, Dec = -31.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 02m, -31d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
