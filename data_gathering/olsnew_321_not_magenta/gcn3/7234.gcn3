Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080129 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 301981) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 352.7s after the GRB trigger
(270.9s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
from 42 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-01-29T06:06:45.216

The fiirst image is 90.0s exposure in tracking mode.
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+352.7s to t0+442.7s : R > 16.4

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+448.5s to t0+1039.0s : R > 18.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=220.9983 lat= -1.4244
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 9 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
