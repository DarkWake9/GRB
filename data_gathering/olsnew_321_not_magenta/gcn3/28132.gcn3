P. D’Avanzo (INAF-OAB), on behalf of the CIBO collaboration report:

Inspection of the SDSS reveals the presence of an extended object, classified as a galaxy, at a position consistent (within ~ 1”) 
with the one reported for the optical afterglow of GRB 200716C (Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 28124; Lipunov et al., GCN Circ. 28125;
 Hu et al., GCN Circ. 28126). 

According to the SDSS DR16 this galaxy has AB magnitudes: 
u = 21.48 +/- 0.21, 
g = 20.46 +/- 0.05, 
r = 19.29 +/- 0.03,
i = 18.88 +/- 0.03, 
z = 18.54 +/- 0.09

and a photoz = 0.348 +/- 0.053.
