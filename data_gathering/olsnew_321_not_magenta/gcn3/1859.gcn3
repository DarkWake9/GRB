"We have observed the field of GRB020819 with the KISO observatory
1.05m schmidt telescope starting at Aug 19.747 UT (2.9 hour after the
burst).  We obtained R and I band data with 300 sec x 4 frames and
three 300 sec x 3 frames respectively.

 We could not identify any stellar object at the position of radio
afterglow (RA) reported by Frail & Berger (GCN 1842). The R band
limiting magnitude is 18.9 mag.  It was estimated by comparison with
field photometry ( Dr. Levan ; private communication). For I band
data, because there are no field photometry, we can not estimate the
limiting magnitude.

Following the DSS-II red image (Plate ID = A0J7), we found that a
faint object is located at near the RA position.  The coordinate is
RA=23:27.20 DEC=+06:15:53 measured by using WCS of the image.

 We thank to Dr. Levan for R band field photometry."
