on behalf of EAFON report:

TNT quickly responsed to the GRB 090426 (Swift trigger 350479;
Cummings et al. GCN 9254) in automatical mode, the first
images was taken start 12:50:03 (UT), 76s after the burst.
We detect a fading source at the position consistent with the
UVOT coordinate (Cummings et al. GCN 9254) thus confirmed the
OT of burst GRB 090426. The brightness in white band
is ~16.4 at 76s after the burst calibrated with USNO A-2.0 R band.
Observation is still under going.
Spectral observation is encouraged.
