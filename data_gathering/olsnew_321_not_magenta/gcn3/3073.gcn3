Klotz, A., Boer M. (OHP), Atteia, J.L., and G. Stratta (LATT) report:

We imaged the entire field of GRB 050306 (cf. Markwardt et al. GCNC 3071)
with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) located at the Calern observatory,
France. Observations started 90 seconds after the begining of the burst.
The source was at an elevation of 15 degrees above the horizon. The Moon did
not rise during the observation, though the burst source location was 19 deg
from it. Nevertheless, haze was present, resulting in a loss of sensitivity.
No new source was detected after a comparison with the DSS2 R image.
We summarize below the limiting magnitude obtained by TAROT :
