The long-duration GRB 160720A (Hamburg, et al., GCN circ. 19724;
Hurley, et al., GCN circ. 19726; Svinkin, et al. GCN circ. 19727;
Amelushkin, et al. GCN circ. 19728) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 18:25:16.38 on 20 July 2016.  No real time CGBM
GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because the real time
communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal) between 17:57 and
18:45.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two main peaks.  The emission starts at
T-5 sec and ends at T+30 sec.  The peak times of the main pulses are T+3 sec
and T+10 sec.  The 3rd weak peak is visible at T+18 sec.  The T90 duration
measured by the SGM data is 36.4 +- 1.7 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
