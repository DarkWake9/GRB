SUBJECT: GRB 090423: Fermi GBM observation (correction of isotropic equivalent energy)

FROM:    Andreas von Kienlin at MPE  <azk@mpe.mpg.de>

A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"The isotropic equivalent energy of GRB 090423 given in 
GCN Circular 9229 has been erroneously computed. 

At a redshift of about 8 the correct value for the isotropic 
equivalent energy is E_iso = (1.0 +/- 0.3)E+53 ergs. 

This value was determined from the observed event fluence of 
(1.1 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2 in the 8 to 1000 keV energy range 
(observer's frame!).

We apologize for this mistake."
