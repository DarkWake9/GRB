S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), E. O. Ofek, S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech), and A.
Rau (MPE Garching) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the location of the possible X-ray afterglow
(Source "B"; Nakahira et al., GCN 11725) of the MAXI GRB110213B (Negoro et
al., GCN 11716) with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.
Observations began at 3:38 UT on 2011 February 15 (~ 37.1 hours after the
burst) in the r' filter.

We detect a source near the reported XRT position with coordinates
(J2000.0):

   02:47:01.41  +01:08:46.3

Using several nearby objects in the USNO-B1 catalog for reference, we
measure a magnitude at this time of R = 19.8.  No object is present at
this location, either in the USNO-B1 catalog or the Digitized Sky Survey.
Given the positional coincidence and the relative brightness, we consider
it likely this is the optical afterglow of GRB110213B.  However, future
observations to establish fading will be required for confirmation.
