TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1853
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030202 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 62460 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  15
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  7.9E-07 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.2E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl. (2000) = 356.094, -40.659 degrees, with radius
26.688 +/- 0.217 degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be refined and/or constrained, but as this
burst was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box
cannot be obtained for it.
