SUBJECT: Second VLA limit on new radio point source in SGR 1806-20

E. Fomalont, B. Clark, and J. Ulvestad report on behalf of NRAO:

We have used the NRAO Very Large Array in its B configuration on
behalf of the community for a second observation of SGR 1806-20, the
apparent source of GRB 060806 (GCN 5416, Hurley et al. 2006; GCN
5419, Hurley et al. 2006).  As noted in GCN 5426 (Golenitskii et al.
2006), the gamma-ray activity is far below that of the large flare
of December 2004.  The observation epoch for the second VLA
observation was 2006AUG11 at 06:10 UT, and there was no detection
of a new radio point source at the location of SGR 1806-20.
The approximate 5-sigma upper limit at 8.46 GHz was < 0.23 mJy,
consistent with the value of < 0.30 mJy seen two days previously
and reported by us in GCN 5427.  This concludes the planned NRAO
service observations of SGR 1806-20 in response to the recent outburst.
