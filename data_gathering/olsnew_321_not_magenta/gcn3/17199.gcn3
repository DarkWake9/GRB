on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope automatically began observing Swift
GRB 141220A (Cummings et al. GCN 17196) on Dec 20 at 06:04:57 UT
(125 sec after the burst trigger).
The robotic LT-TRAP pipeline identified the optical afterglow
at the position reported by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 17197)
with r=18.6 +- 0.1 mag at 34 minutes after the GRB,
calibrated against nearby SDSS-R stars.
