WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to AGILE/MCAL GRB 180914B (Ursi et al.,
GCN 23226 starting at Sep. 16, 03:47:39 UT, namely ~1.392 days
after the burst. Observations were performed with a sequence in the
clear (roughly R), B, V, R, and I filters, and the exposure time was
60 s per image. Inside the reported Swift/XRT afterglow error circle
(D'Ai et al., GCN 23236) we detected an optical afterglow candidate
at position:
RA:  22:09:25.55 (J2000)
Dec: +25:03:43.90 (J2000)
We estimate the clear band magnitude ~19.2. At this time, we can not
estimate the changes of the brightness. But the object was not presented
in the SDSS image, we therefore suggest it to be the optical  afterglow of
GRB 180914B.
Observation are on going, multi-band follow-ups are encouraged.
