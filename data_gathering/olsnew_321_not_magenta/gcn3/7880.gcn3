C. Clemens, A. Updike (Clemson University), T. Kruehler, J. Greiner, A. Kupcu 
Yoldas, A. Yoldas (all MPE Garching) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest 
and MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080613A (INTEGRAL trigger 5288; Gotz et al., GCN 
#7871) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 
120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory 
(Chile).

Observations started at 00:25 UT on June 14th, 2008, 14.8 hrs after the GRB 
trigger with 25 mins of effective exposures in g'r'i'z' and 20 mins in JHK.

We do not detect any object at the position reported by Guidorzi et al., GCN 
#7872) to the following 3-sigma upper limits:

g' > 24.2,
r' > 23.9,
i' > 23.5,
z' > 23.4,
J > 22.3 and
H > 21.3.

Given upper limits are calibrated against SDSS as well as 2MASS field stars.

This indicates a clear fading of the source. We therefore confirm this to be 
the afterglow of GRB 080613A.
