Report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,
(=H2656, Vanderspek et al. GCN 1997), identified
by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986),
in the Johnson B-Band with the SARA 0.9m telescope at 
KPNO. We obtained 45, 300s exposures.  Observations
began at 02:55:09UT, and ended at 06:50:58UT, on March
30th.  The obsevations were carried out under good 
seeing conditions.  Aperture photometry was performed, 
and calibrated utilizing standards reported by Henden
et al., GCN 2023.  During the observational period, 
the afterglow faded by approximately 0.5mag.  Further 
observations are planned.
