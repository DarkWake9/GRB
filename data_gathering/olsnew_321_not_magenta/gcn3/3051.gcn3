TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3051
SUBJECT: GRB050215b: Faulkes North and SDSS limits on UKIRT candidate

A. Monfardini (Liverpool), N. Tanvir (Hertfordshire), C. Mundell
(Liverpool), R. Smith (Liverpool), A. Levan (Leicester), E. Rol
(Leicester), P. O'Brien (Leicester) and M. Bode (Liverpool) 
on behalf of the ROBONET collaboration report:

"We observed the field of GRB050215b (GCN 3024) with the 2.0m Faulkes
North Telescope on Haleakala. We obtained SDSS-I imaging commencing 
1.229 days after the burst under poor seeing conditions. A re-analysis at
the position of the candidate first reported by Tanvir et. al and then
confirmed by XRT (GCN 3031, GCN 3034) shows no detection on our images up
to I=20.5 (limited by technical problems). 

We reiterate the coordinates:

RA=11:37:47.90   DEC=+40:47:45.6

We also searched for possible hosts in SDSS plates (observations date: 
2003-04-01) and found no candidates within 5 arcsec up to (SDSS filters):

u = 21.0
g = 21.9
r = 22.0  (R ~ 21.9)
i = 21.7  (I ~ 21.3)
z = 20.2
  
These values were derived using SDSS field photometry references."
