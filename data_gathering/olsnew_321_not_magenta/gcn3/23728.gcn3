T. Laskar (University of Bath), K. D. Alexander (Northwestern), E. Berger
(Harvard), W. Fong (Northwestern), R. Margutti (Northwestern), C. G.
Mundell (University of Bath), and P. Schady (University of Bath) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 190114C (Gropp et al. GCN 23688) with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) starting at 3.2 hr after the burst at
90 GHz. Preliminary analysis reveals a bright (S/N > 800), fading mm
counterpart at a location consistent with the X-ray position (Osborne et
al. GCN 23704) and optical position (Tyurina et al., GCN
23690; Lipunov et al., GCN 23693). Follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the JAO staff, AoD, and the ALMA team for their help with these
observations."
