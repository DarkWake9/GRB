GRB030528: Planned Target of Opportunity Observations with Chandra 
X-ray Observatory

G. Ricker, P. Ford, N. Butler, R. Vanderspek, J. Villasenor (MIT), D. 
Lamb (U. Chicago), and J.G. Jernigan (UCB), on behalf of a Chandra 
GRB ToO Team,

write:

Chandra target-of-opportunity observations of the HETE SXC error 
circle for GRB030528 (=H2724: Atteia et al, GCN 2256; Villasenor et 
al, GCN 2261) are currently planned. The region to be imaged with 
ACIS will extend +/- 4 arcmin about the revised location reported by 
Villasenor et al (GCN2261). The first epoch observation should take 
place near 3-4 June, with a second epoch observation ~1 week later.

The scheduling of contemporaneous observations at other wavelengths 
is strongly encouraged.
