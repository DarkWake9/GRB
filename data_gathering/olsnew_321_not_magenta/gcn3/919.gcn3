P. A. Price, G. Morrison and J. S. Bloom (Caltech) report on behalf of the
larger Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"We observed the IPN error box of the short/hard GRB010119 (Hurley et al.,
GCN #916) with the Palomar 60-inch telescope on 2001 Jan 20.56 and 21.57 UT
(1.13 and 2.14 days after the burst respectively) in difficult
conditions.  In particular, the seeing was ~ 5.5 arcsec and 3.5 arcsec for
the two epochs, respectively.  From visual inspection of the combined images,
we do not detect any objects within the error box that are not present on the
Digital Sky Survey 2 red plate.  Limiting magnitudes of our images are
R ~ 18 mag and R ~ 21 mag for the first and second epoch respectively,
based on comparison with stars in the USNO-A2.0 catalogue.  The quality of
the first epoch image does not allow us to search for variable objects
between the two epochs."
