SUBJECT: GRB 130327B: Fermi-LAT detection of a burst

M. Ohno (Hiroshima U.), J. McEnery (NASA/GSFC), G. Vianello (Stanford),
J.L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) and E. Troja (CRESST) report on behalf of the
Fermi-LAT team:

At 08:24:04 on March 27th, 2013, Fermi LAT detected high energy emission
from GRB 130327B, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 386065447 /
130327350 ; Chaplin and Fitzpatrick GCN 14346) and by  AGILE  (Del Monte et
al. GCN 14344).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be RA, DEC 218.09, -69.51
(J2000) with an error radius of 0.17 deg (68% containment, statistical
error only), this was about 50 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of
the trigger and triggered an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.

The data from the Fermi LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
within 5 degree of the GBM location after the GBM trigger that is spatially
and temporally correlated with the GBM emission with high significance.
More than 20 photons above 100 MeV are observed within 100 seconds.

A Swift TOO observation has been requested.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Julie McEnery (
julie.mcenery@nasa.gov).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an
international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many
scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
