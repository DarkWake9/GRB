"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 051016B (GCN4103) with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm
telescopeat University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 19:16:07 UT on Oct.16.
After co-adding a set of 25 images (19:16:07 - 19:59:25 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than
