 We observed the field of Swift GRB 140206A (Lien et al., GCN#15784) with
the 1.0 meter T100 telescope (Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey), starting February, 06, 16:33:24 UT (~ 9.268 hours after the
trigger). Observations were carried out in the R filter under good weather
conditions. The afterglow is clearly detected in 300 s in the R band images
at a position that is consistent with Oksanen et al. GCN#15786 and Oates et
al., GCN#15787

Using USNO-B1 star USNO-B1 1567-0128093 (R.A.=9:41:23.33, Dec=+66:44:32.31)
in the field, the magnitudes of the OT were estimated as follows;

t-t0 (hr) exp.(s) filt mag err (+/-)

9.590 300 R 18.65 0.05

9.689 300 R 18.77 0.06

9.788 300 R 18.75 0.06

10.380 300 R 18.89 0.06

 Further observations using the same filter are ongoing.

We are grateful to TUBITAK National Observatory for prompt scheduling the
observations and technical support.
