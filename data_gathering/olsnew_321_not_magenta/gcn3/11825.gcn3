A.J. Levan (U. Warwick) and N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report for a
larger collaboration:

"We observed the localization of the GRB / X-ray transient GRB 110328A
(BAT trigger ID 450158/450161) with Gemini-N/GMOS on 28 March 2011,
starting at 15:02 UT, two hours after the initial trigger, and 1.3
hours after the second trigger from the same source.  Observations
were obtained in very poor conditions, with substantial extinction
due to cloud.  At the X-ray localisation of GRB 110328A we do not
find any evidence for a source down to a limiting magnitude of
R>22.2, calibrated against USNO stars."
