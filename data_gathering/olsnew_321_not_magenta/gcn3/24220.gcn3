larger collaboration:

We observed ZTF19aarykkb (Kasliwal et al., GCN 24191) using the the DeVeny
spectrograph mounted on the 4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope.
We obtained 22.5 min exposures at an average airmass of 1.5. Our spectra
cover
the wavelength range ~3,600-8,000 Angstrom.
A preliminary analysis our spectrum shows a bright emission line likely
associated to the H-alpha transition and a relatively featureless
continuum.
Overall our results are consistent with the reports from Pavana (GCN 24200)
and
Perley (GCN 24204).

We thank the staff of the Discovery Channel Telescope in particular Andrew
Hayslip,
Ishara Nisley for assistance with these observations. We also thank
Jennifer Hanley
for contributing her time.
