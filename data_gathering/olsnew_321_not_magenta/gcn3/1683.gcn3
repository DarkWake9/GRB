TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1683
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021108 (large error box)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

This event (GCN 1679) was also observed by RHESSI.  Triangulation,
RHESSI Earth-blocking, and the Konus ecliptic latitude response
constrain the annulus (RA, Decl(2000)=0.517, -35.271 degrees, radius
47.726 +/-  0.026 degrees, 3 sigma) to that portion between RA,
Dec=296.8, -67.1 degrees, and 297.4, -46.5 degrees.

Only minor improvements to this localization are expected.  As the Mars
Odyssey spacecraft was in safe mode, with all instruments off, a small
error box cannot be derived for this event.
