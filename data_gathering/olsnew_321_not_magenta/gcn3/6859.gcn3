A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC),
N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), S. T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC),
D. M. Palmer (LANL), M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) and
T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 03:41:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071010 (trigger=293707). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 288.101, -32.379 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 12m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 22' 42"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a broad
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled outside of
business hours (US EDT).  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Moretti (moretti AT merate.mi.astro.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
