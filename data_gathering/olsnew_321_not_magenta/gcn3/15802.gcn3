V. D'Elia (INAF/OAR & ASI/ASDC), P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino, A. Melandri  
(INAF-OAB), S. D. Vergani (CNRS/GEPI), L. Di Fabrizio (INAF/TNG)  
report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We report further observations of the field of GRB 140206A (Lien et  
al., GCN 15784; Gotz et  al., GCN 15785) with the Telescopio Nazionale  
Galileo (TNG) equipped with DOLORES.

We obtained a spectrum of the optical source reported in  D'Avanzo et  
al. (GCN Circ. 15799), with a total exposure of 1800 s, using the  
grism LR_B covering the wavelength range 3000 - 8000 AA. The  
observation started at 2014-02-06T19:53:07, i.e., ~12.6 hrs after the  
GRB.


We detect several absorption lines which we interpret as due to Ly-alpha,
NV, Si II, C II, SiIV, C IV, Al II, AlII and Fe II at a common  
redshift of 2.74. In addition, we also detect at the same redshift  
fine structure lines from excited levels of SiII and FeII, confirming  
that this is the redshift of the GRB host galaxy. Our result is in  
perfect agreement with the reported value by Malesani et al. (GCN 15800)

Finally, we also detect a strong intervening Ly-alpha absorber at z~2.32
