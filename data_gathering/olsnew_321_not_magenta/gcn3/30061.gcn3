During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B triggered a long burst,
GRB 210520A, at 2021-05-20T19:07:03.550 UTC (denoted as T0), 
which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #30059) and 
INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS（TrigID 9218）.

GECAM alert data was promptly downlinked to the ground through the
short message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).
The time latency of the first BeiDou message relative to the trigger time
is about 1 minute.

According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of 
multiple pulses with a duration of about 50s.  

An automatic on-ground localization was calculated using the light curves
and spectrum. Although the in-flight calibration of energy response and
localization has not been finalized yet, GECAM-B localized this burst to
the following position (J2000):
ra: 129.04 deg
dec: -72.01 deg
err: 5.55 deg (statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration. 

GECAM location is consistent with the Fermi/GBM(GCN #30059) position within the error.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

As the detailed science data are downloaded, all analyses would be improved.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
