report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 160829A (Racusin et al. GCN Circ. 19879),
collecting 4.8 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+37.4 ks
and T0+61.4 ks. 

No X-ray source has been detected within the LAT error region (Racusin
et al. GCN Circ. 19879), with a 3 sigma upper limit count rate of
2.6e-3 ct/s (0.3-10keV). 

An uncatalogued X-ray source was detected 13.3 arcmin from the LAT
position at a count rate of (4.9 +/- 1.9)e-3 ct/s. This source is
identified by SIMBAD as CD-56 4975 at RA, Dec (J2000) = 13h 28m 03.68s,
-56d 54m 30.38s, whose colours are suggestive of a late-type star,
which is, therefore, unlikely to be related to the LAT burst.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020687.
