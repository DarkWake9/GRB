A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:28:39.21 UT on 23 March 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150323B (trigger 448795722 / 150323395), 
which was also detected by the Swift (Cummings et al. 2015, GCN 17619).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks 
with a duration (T90) of about 54 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.512 s to T0+60.929 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 99.14 (+4.50/-6.02) keV,
alpha = -0.89 (+0.07/-0.05), and beta = -2.04 (+0.03/-0.03). 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.19 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.152  s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
