A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:30:58.23 UT on 09 February 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140209A (trigger 413623861 / 140209313),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cenko et al. 2014, GCN 15808).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. The
initial angle from the LAT boresight was 77 deg from the Fermi/GBM
position.

The GBM light curve consists of a bright pulse with a small precursor
at trigger time with a duration (T90) of about 1.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.192 s to T0+2.752 s is best fit by
a Band function with Epeak = 144 +/- 8 keV,
alpha = -0.56 +/- 0.06, and beta = -2.33 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.5 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.664 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 120.5 +/- 3.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
