behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190720a at T0 = 2019-07-20
00:08:36.747 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE Minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event candidate at T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 sec integration time at
T0 for different celestial positions within the accessible 90% c.l.
localization region (LR) of S190720a (almost 65% of the LR), from a minimum
of 1.39E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 5.02E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as
spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

We notice an MCAL trigger event 2.53 sec after T0 in the 32 msec lightcurve
with a S/N of 5.1. We are assessing the statistical significance of this
feature.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
