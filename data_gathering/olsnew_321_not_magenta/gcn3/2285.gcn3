TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2285
SUBJECT: GRB030329:  second XMM-Newton observation

A.Tiengo (IASF-Milano), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano) and N.Schartel
(XMM-Newton SOC, Villafranca) report:

A 24 hour long observation of GRB030329 has been obtained with XMM-Newton
starting at 21 UT on May 28, 2003. After rejecting high background time
intervals, the net exposure time in the EPIC instrument is about 40 ks.

The X-ray afterglow is detected at a level of (7+/-3)x10^-15 erg cm^-2
s^-1 (observed flux in the 2-10 keV range). This value is consistent with
the late time (t>1 day) flux evolution as a power law with index ~1.9, as
reported by Tiengo et al. (astro-ph/0305564).

The X-ray spectrum is well fit by a power law with photon index 2.2+/-0.4
and absorption <9x10^20 cm^-2.
