"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and the Wide Field Camera
(WFC) unit 1 detected GRB020321 on March 21.18102 UT. The GRB
was faint and has been discovered only by ground trigger logic.
The event detected by the GRBM shows an irregular single pulse profile
with a time duration of about 70 s and a peak count rate of 130+- 40 c/s,
as estimated with 1 s time resolution, in the 40-700 keV energy band.

In the WFC, the duration is about 1.5 min and the peak flux
is about 0.3 Crab (2-26 keV). The centroid position of the X-ray
counterpart from the WFC image is R.A. = 16h13m05s, Dec = -83d42'35"
(equinox 2000.0) with an error radius of 5' (99% CL).

A follow-up observation with BeppoSAX narrow-field instruments is in
progress."
