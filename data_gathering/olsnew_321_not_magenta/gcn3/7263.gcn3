The long hard GRB 080204 (Golenetskii et al., GCN 7256)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=50190.835 (13:56:30.835).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.65(-0.47, +0.37)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.032 s
of 9.52(-2.49, +2.25)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 6 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(not including the precursor; from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 6 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.35(-0.09, +0.06)
and Ep = 1279(-382, +469) keV (chi2 = 79.2/78 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
