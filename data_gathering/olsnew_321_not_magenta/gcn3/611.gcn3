TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  611
SUBJECT: GRB000301C - B and R photometry
DATE:    00/03/14 23:57:10 GMT
FROM:    Christian Veillet at CFHT  <veillet@cfht.hawaii.edu>

The candidate for the optical transient (OT) associated with the gamma 
ray burst GRB000301C has been observed in imaging mode with OSIS on 
the 3.6-m CFH Telescope in the course of the French GRB follow-up 
program at CFHT (M. Boer, CESR, C. Veillet, CFHT). 

The OT has the following magnitude, using star A (GCN573) photometry 
(GCN583): 

R = 23.82 +/- 0.10   2000 March 14.60 (UTC) 
(two 30mn exposures) 

B = 24.83 +/- 0.12   2000 March 14.60 (UTC) 
(one 55mn exposure) 

The power-law decay described with alpha = -2.1 +/- 0.1 (GCN610) is not
sufficient to account properly for the last four measurements (GCN598, 
604, 610 and this GCN), which are better fit with alpha = -2.7 +/- 0.1 . 
The first phase of the decay would cover the first four days after the 
burst, with alpha = -0.91 +/- 0.08. A graph with these two consecutive 
power laws, as well at the new images, are at 
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~veillet/grb.html 

As for the apparent B-R, the error bars are large enough to make it close 
to the value determined using MOS on March 3.5 (0.86 +/- 0.06) or the one 
published by Halpern (0.77 +/- 0.06 in GCN585 a week ago). 

As the GRB is still steadily decaying, it's unlikely to have the underlying
galaxy contributing significantly to the measured flux. This galaxy should 
probably be fainter than R = 24.5, confirming the comment by Fruchter et al. 
(GCN602) from HST imaging data (R >~ 24). 

A 20 micron camera will be installed on the telescope today for 10 nights. 
No new data on this GRB will be acquired during this period. 

Aloha from Hawaii!
