The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:29:25 UT on 4 Feb 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210204A (trigger 634112970.655966 / 210204270).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 109.1, Dec = 9.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 16m, 9d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 57.0 degrees.
