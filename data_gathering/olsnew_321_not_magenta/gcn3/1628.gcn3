We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB021004,
originally reported by Fox et al., GCN 1564, with the
SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO. We obtained 30, 300s
exposures in the Johnson R band filter.  Observations
began at 07:03:05UT, and ended at 09:42:20UT, on October
5th.  The obsevations were carried out under good seeing
conditions.  Aperture photometry was performed, and
calibrated utilizing standards reported by Henden et al.,
GCN 1583.

We find a mean R magnitude of 19.1 +- 0.2.

Observations were also performed on the night of October
9th. Data analysis is currently in progress.

We thank SARA Observatory director Dr. J. Webb for making
part of his observing time available to us.
