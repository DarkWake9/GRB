S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB071118 (Cummings et al., GCN 7106) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope beginning at 01:49 UT on 19 November.
We do not detect any source at the location of the optical afterglow (de
Pasquale et al., GCN 7116).  Using the USNO-B1 catalog as a reference, we
calculate upper limits of R > 22.5, i' > 22.5 at this epoch.
