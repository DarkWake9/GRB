E. Berger (Harvard) and D. Kelson (OCIW) report:

"We imaged the BAT error circle of the short GRB 090305 (GCN 8932) with
IMACS on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope.  Observations were taken in R
band on 2009 March 5 at 06:48 and 09:11 UT (88 and 231 min after the
burst, respectively).  We confirm the existence of the fading source
reported by Cenko et al. from Gemini South observations (GCN 8933) and
consider this source to be the afterglow of GRB 090305."
