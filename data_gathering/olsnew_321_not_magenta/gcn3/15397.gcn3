S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on 
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

G. Di Cocco, F. Fuschino, M. Galli, C. Labanti, and M. Marisaldi, on
behalf of the AGILE MCAL team, report:

The long, bright GRB 131028A was observed by Konus-Wind, Fermi (GCN 
15396), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Swift (BAT), AGILE (MCAL), and MESSENGER 
(GRNS) at about 6542 s UT (01:49:02). The burst was outside the coded 
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    61.225 (04h 04m 54s) +71.595 (+71d 35' 41")
  Corners:
    69.087 (04h 36m 21s) +70.098 (+70d 05' 51")
    66.215 (04h 24m 52s) +70.982 (+70d 58' 56")
    52.752 (03h 31m 00s) +72.570 (+72d 34' 14")
    56.127 (03h 44m 30s) +72.015 (+72d 00' 52")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.3 sq. deg, and its maximum dimension is
5.8 deg (the minimum one is 1.2 deg).

Some improvement in this triangulation is possible.
