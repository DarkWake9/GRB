S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 061121 (Page et al., GCN 5823) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of 25 x 180 s
exposures in the Kron R and Sloan i' filters, taken at a mean epoch of
approximately 11:30 22 November UT (~ 20.1 hr after the burst).

The afterglow is clearly detected in our images, and we measure the
following magnitudes (calculated with reference to the USNO-B catalog):

	R = 21.0 +/- 0.25
        I = 20.3 +/- 0.21

The large errors are dominated by photometric uncertainty.  We note the
R-band measurements are consistent with nearly-simultaneous observations
reported by Halpern et al. (GCN 5840).

Further observations are planned.
