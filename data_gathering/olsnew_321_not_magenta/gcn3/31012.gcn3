The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:51:52 UT on 27 Oct 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211027A (trigger 657006717.695746 / 211027244).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 278.6, Dec = 19.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 34m, 19d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 24.0 degrees.
