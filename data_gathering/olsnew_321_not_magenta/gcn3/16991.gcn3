We observed the field of GRB 141028A (Bissaldi, et al., GCN 16969) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/10 30.08 to 2014/10 30.31 UTC (39.07
to 44.46 hours after the GBM trigger), obtaining a total of 4.24 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the enhanced XRT error circle (Pagani et al., GCN 
16986),
in comparison with the SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections:

   r    21.19 ± 0.04
   i    20.79 ± 0.03
   z    20.74 ± 0.24

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  A comparison to our previous
observations (Troja et al., GCN 16980) shows that the afterglow faded 
with a
power-law decay index of alpha ~ 0.9 in all three filters, consistent 
with the decay
reported by Cenko & Perley (GCN 16989).

Further observations are planned.

Mártir.
