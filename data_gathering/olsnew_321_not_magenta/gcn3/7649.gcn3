The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaged the field of burst
GRB080430 prior to the burst.  As these data should be useful
as a pre-burst comparison and for calibrating photometry,
we are supplying the images and photometry measurements for
this GRB field to the community.

Data from the SDSS, including 5 FITS images, 3 JPGS, and
3 files of photometry and astrometry, are being placed at
http://mizar.as.arizona.edu/~grb/public/GRB080430

We supply FITS images in each of the 5 SDSS bands of a 8'x8'
region centered on the GRB position (ra=165.322 (11:01:17.3),
dec=51.6890 (51:41:20.4); Swift-BAT TRIGGER 310613), as well
as 3 gri color-composite JPGs (with different stretches). The
units in the FITS images are nanomaggies per pixel.  A pixel
is 0.396 arcsec on a side. A nanomaggie is a flux-density unit
equal to 10^-9 of a magnitude 0 source or, to the extent that
SDSS is an AB system, 3.631e-6 Jy.  The FITS images have WCS
astrometric information.

In the file GRB080430_sdss.calstar.dat, we report photometry
and astrometry of 193 bright stars (r<20.5) within 15' of the
burst location.  The magnitudes presented in this file are asinh
magnitudes as are standard in the SDSS (Lupton 1999, AJ, 118,
1406). Beware that some of these stars are not well-detected
in the u-band; use the errors and object flags to monitor
data quality.

In the files GRB080430_sdss.objects_flux.dat and
GRB080430_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat, we report photometry
of 582 objects detected within 6' of the GRB position.
We have removed saturated objects and objects with model
magnitudes fainter than 23.0 in the r-band.  The fluxes listed
in GRB080430_sdss.objects_flux.dat are in nanomaggies while
the magnitudes listed in GRB080430_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat
are asinh magnitudes.

All quantities reported are standard SDSS photometry, meaning
that they are very close to AB zeropoints and magnitudes are
quoted in asinh magnitudes.  Photometric zeropoints are known
to about 2% rms.  None of the photometry is corrected for
dust extinction.  The Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998)
predictions for this region are A_U=0.061 mag, A_g=0.045 mag,
A_r = 0.032 mag, A_i=0.025 mag, and A_z=0.017 mag.

There are currently no objects within 6 arcminutes of the GRB
position in the SDSS spectroscopic database.


SDSS astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcsecond per
coordinate.  Users requiring high precision astrometry should
take note that the SDSS astrometric system can differ from
other systems such as those used in other notices; we have
not checked the offsets in this region.

More detailed information pertaining to our SDSS GRB releases
can be found in our initial data release paper (Cool et
al. 2006, PASP 118, 733).  See the SDSS DR4 documentation for
more details: http://www.sdss.org/dr5.

These data have been reduced using a slightly different
pipeline than that used for SDSS public data releases.
We cannot guarantee that the values here will exactly match
those in the data release in which these data are included.
In particular, we expect the photometric calibrations to differ
by of order 0.01 mag.

release paper, Adelman-McCarthy et al. (2007, ApJS, 172, 634),
