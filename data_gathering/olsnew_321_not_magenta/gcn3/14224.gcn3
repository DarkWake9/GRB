"Following the detection of GRB 130216A by Swift (Melandri et al. GCN
Circ. 14223), we are carrying out I-band observations with the 1.5m OSN
telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory starting 32 min post burst. We do
not find any new or varying optical source within the 3’ radius Swift/BAT
error cirle down to I about 20. Observations are ongoing.”
