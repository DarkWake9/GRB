TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

B. E. Cobb (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical imaging of the error region of GRB 060130
(GCN 4615, Mereghetti et al.) starting 09:14 2006-01-30 UT (~4.3
hours post-burst).  The imaging was conducted during twilight,
which limited the number and depth of the images we were able to
obtain.  The ANDICAM's optical field of view is 6'x6' and, therefore,
covers the entire GRB error circle.

Preliminary visual comparison of a 30 second R-band image to the SDSS
does not reveal any new sources.   The detection limits of this ANDICAM
image are slightly shallower than that of the SDSS.
