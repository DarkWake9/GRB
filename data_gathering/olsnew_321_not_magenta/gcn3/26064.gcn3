SUBJECT: GRB 191024A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 839 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT
images for GRB 191024A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 10.11473, -67.14506 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 00h 40m 27.53s
Dec (J2000): -67d 08' 42.2"

with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
