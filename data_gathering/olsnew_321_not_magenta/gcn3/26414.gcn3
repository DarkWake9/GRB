The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:49:07 UT on 13 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191213B (trigger 597955752.969344 / 191213784).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 331.1, Dec = -13.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 04m, -13d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 29.0 degrees.
