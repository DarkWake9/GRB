We reobserved the field of the LAT GRB 150724B (Bissaldi et al., GCN 
18065) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; 
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio 
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/07 27.24 to 
2015/07 27.47 UTC (8819.11 to 8824.45 hours after the Fermi trigger), 
obtaining a total of 4.01 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

We detect the source we previously reported (Butler et al. GCN 18072) at 
23:27:33.82 +3:49:06.8 (J2000, ±0.5"). In comparison with the SDSS DR9, we 
obtain the following detections:

   r	23.50 ± 0.19
   i	23.99 ± 0.27

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic 
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

A naive comparison to our observations from the previous night would 
suggest that the source has not faded in r but has faded in i. However, 
examining the images in detail, we suspect that our photometry in i from 
the first night might be influenced by a spuriously bright pixel. We 
therefore discount the apparent fading in i.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
