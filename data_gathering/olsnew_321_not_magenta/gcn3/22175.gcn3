E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Kusakin (FAPHI),  I. Reva 
(FAPHI), A. Volnova (IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field  of the Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 171124A 
(Longo et al. GCN   22156) with Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Tien Shan 
Astronomical Observatory starting on Nov. 27 (UT) 12:28:32. We took 
several images in R-filter with exposures of 120 s. We cover all LAT- 
localization region.
The three XRT sources ## 1,3,4 (Osborne  et al. GCN   22165)  are 
detected in our stacked image. These sources are also presented in the 
USNO-B1.0 catalogue. We do not detect any optical object within X-ray 
afterglow (XRT #2 error circle, Osborne  et al. GCN  22174).  We may 
note that 4.5 arcsec South of XRT #2    we detect a galaxy which is also 
present in USNO-B1.0.

Preliminary photometry of the field is following:

The photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars
