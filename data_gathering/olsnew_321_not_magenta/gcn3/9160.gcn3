P. Chandra (RMC) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to image a field centered on
the 2MASS galaxy suggested by Fox (GCN #9134) to be a possible host of
the short duration burst 090417A (GCN # 9133, 9138). The VLA observed
the burst at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on two epochs, April 17.92 UT and
April 18.90 UT. Within a radius of 1.5 arcmin around the 2MASS galaxy
there are no radio sources detected at either epoch to a 4-sigma limit
of 104 uJy and 84 uJy, respectively. No further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
