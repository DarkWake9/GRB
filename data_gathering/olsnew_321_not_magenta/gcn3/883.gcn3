V.Rumjantsev and L.Pavlenko (on behalf of Crimean Observatory and Space
Research Institute (Moscow) GRB follow-up teams) report:

"We have imaged of the error box for GRB 001109 (G. Gandolfi et al., GCN 878) with the 0.64-m 
and the 0.38-m Cassegrain telescopes of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. 
A first frame was obtained on Nov 9 15:50:21 UT (i.e. 6.5 hours after the GRB). 
Conditions were not so good. Our images cover all but the square half degree.
No new objects are seen within the error box when comparing to the DSS-2 (R-band), 
brighter a limiting integral magnitude of 20 mag (at 0.64-m telescope) and also 
brighter then 17 mag in V (at 0.38-m telescope)."
