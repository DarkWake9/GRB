L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:26:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080725 (trigger=317888).  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 121.715, -13.990 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 06m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = -13d 59' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 60 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to proximity to the Sun, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
The source will not be observable until September. There will thus 
be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
