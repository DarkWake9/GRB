     We have obtained R-band images of the error box of GRB 020409
(Piro 2002, GCN 1347) using the Danish 0.5m Brorfelde Schmidt
telescope.  The first epoch images were taken on 2002 April 10 at
20:25 UT and had a total exposure time of 1200 seconds.  The second
epoch images were taken on 2002 April 10 at 22:35 and had a total
exposure time of 2400 seconds.  We subtracted the combined exposures
from each epoch using the methods described in Schmidt et al. (1998,
ApJ, 507, 46).  We find no evidence that any object in the BeppoSAX
error box varies by more than approximately 0.1 mag in the two hours
between the centres of the two epochs.  The limiting magnitude of
this search is approximately R = 20.  We also combined all of the
images from both epochs to obtain an image with a limiting magnitude
of approximately R = 21.  We compared this image with the Digital Sky
Survey (DSS) and found no new sources to the detection limit of the
DSS.

     The combined images will be made available at
<http://www.nd.edu/~sholland/grb/grb020409/index.html>.
