WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, observed the Swift GRB 190829A (Dichiara et al.,
GCN 25552) starting at 0.604 days after the burst. Observations
were performed with a total of 8 images in clear (roughly R) filters
with exposure time of 60 s per image. We detected the optical
afterglow (Xu et al., GCN 25555; Lipunov et al., GCN 25558
Kumar et al., GCN 25560; Heintz et al., GCN 25563; Valeev et al.,
GCN 25565; Chen et al., GCN 25569; Oates et al., GCN 25570; Lipunov
et al., GCN 25573) in our co-added images and we estimate the
clear band magnitude to be ~19.0 without applying galaxy subtraction.
