The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:20:24 UT on 24 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220624B (trigger 677758829.234126 / 220624431).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 97.8, Dec = 41.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 31m, 41d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 92.0 degrees.
