Using the data set from T-240 to T+714 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140824A (trigger #610501)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 16732).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 206.627, 33.285 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  13h 46m 30.4s
    Dec(J2000) = +33d 17' 05.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with a FRED-like profile, 
starting at T+0 and lasting approximately five seconds. T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.09 
+- 0.50 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.26 to T+3.64 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.98 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.34 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
