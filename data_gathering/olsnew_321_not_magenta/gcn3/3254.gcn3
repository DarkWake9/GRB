M. Capalbi (ASDC), P. Romano (INAF-OAB), V. Mangano (INAF-IASF/Palermo), O. 
Godet (U. Leicester), L. Angelini (GSFC) and D. N. Burrows (PSU) report on 
behalf of the
Swift XRT team:

On 10 April 2004 we reported detection of a possible jet break in Swift XRT 
data on GRB 050408, with additional observations scheduled to verify the 
break in the light curve (Godet et al. 2005, GCN 3222).  We now have 
analyzed new data extending to about 300,000 s after the burst, and can 
state that the reported possible jet break is not confirmed by the later 
observations.  No jet break is seen in the XRT data up to 300,000 s after 
the burst.

Additional observations are planned over the next several days to continue 
to search for a jet break in this afterglow.
