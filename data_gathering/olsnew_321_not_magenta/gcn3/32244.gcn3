SUBJECT: GRB 220623A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    22/06/23 08:35:46 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

J.A. Kennea (PSU), G. Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), M. Perri (SSDC &
INAF-OAR), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and
D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 220623A at 08:11:23.5 UT,
4029.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 145.39717,
75.82155 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 09h 41m 35.32s
   Dec(J2000) = +75d 49' 17.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 61 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.49 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.4
(+2.74/-2.39) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
