SUBJECT: GRB 210321A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    21/03/21 15:54:59 GMT

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1720 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT
images for GRB 210321A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 87.89579, +70.13057 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 05h 51m 34.99s
Dec (J2000): +70d 07' 50.1"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
