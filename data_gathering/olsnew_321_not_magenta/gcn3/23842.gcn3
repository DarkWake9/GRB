D. Malesani (DAWN/NBI and DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), and H. J. Deeg (IAC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 190202A (Lien et al., GCN 23830) using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the StanCam imager. Observations were carried out starting on 2019 Feb 3.06 UT (0.99 days after the GRB). A total of 3x600 s in the SDSS g band was acquired.

Calibrating against nearby reference stars from the SDSS catalog, we measure for the afterglow a preliminary magnitude of g = 21.72 +- 0.03 (AB).
