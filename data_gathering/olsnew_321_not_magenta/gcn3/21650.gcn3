K. P. Mooley (Hintze Fellow, Oxford) and G. Hallinan (Caltech) report on 
behalf of the JAGWAR team

We have initiated deep S band (2-4 GHz) observations of the potential 
host galaxies of the GW event G29048 from the CLU list (Cook et al. 
2017, LVC GCN 21535). The pointings, observed as part of the Jansky 
Array mapping of GW bursts as Afterglows in Radio (JAGWAR) program, have 
RMS noise between 10-20 uJy. The first observing epoch of NGC 4993 on 
2017 Aug 20.93 shows no radio source at the location of SSS17a (Coulter 
et al. 2017, LVC GCN 21529), with a 3sigma upper limit of ~40 uJy. We 
will report any radio transients found through the LVC GCN system.

We thank the VLA staff for scheduling these observations.
