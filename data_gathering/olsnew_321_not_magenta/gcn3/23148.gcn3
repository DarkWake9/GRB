A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and F.E. Marshall report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 180818A (Marshall et al.
GCN Circ. 23146), from 80 s to 17.2 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 587 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 23147).

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=6.0 (+0.8, -0.6), followed by a break at T+172 s to an
alpha of 0.63 (+/-0.10).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.8 (+0.5, -0.4). The
best-fitting absorption column is  8.9 (+3.1, -2.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11 (1.2 x 10^-10) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     8.9 (+3.1, -2.6) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 4.9 sigma
Photon index:	     2.8 (+0.5, -0.4)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.63, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 4.5 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.4 x
10^-13 (5.5 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
