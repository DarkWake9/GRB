Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070429 (trigger #277582)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 6358).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 328.006, -38.857 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 52m 1.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 51' 24.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 66%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows 3 or 4 overlapping peaks starting at
~T-0.2s sec and ending at ~T+0.5 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.5 +- 0.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+0.3 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.71 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.3 +- 1.0 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.45 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
