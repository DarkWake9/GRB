M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL), V. D'Elia (ASDC) and P. Kuin (MSSL-UCL)
report, on behalf of the Swift team:

GRB110213A (D'Elia et al., GCN circ 11705) exhibits an interesting 
behaviour both in the X-ray and optical bands. After a broad peak and 
phase of normal decline, the lightcurves show achromatic breaks at about
T0+10 ks, after which the slopes in both bands becomes about -2. These 
data strongly indicate that we are seeing a very early jet break. We 
encourage observations from ground facilities.

The predicted magnitudes for 00:00 UT of 15/2/2011 are R ~ 22.6,
v ~ 21.7, b ~ 23.8, u ~ 21.7.
