TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1951
SUBJECT: GRB030323, optical observations
DATE:    03/03/24 20:43:25 GMT
FROM:    Weidong Li at UC Berkeley KAIT/LOSS  <weidong@astron.berkeley.edu>

W. Li, S. Jha, R. Chornock, and A. V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley), report
that unfiltered images of a 12 arcmin x 12 arcmin region centered at the 
position of GRB 030323 (HETE Trigger #2640) were taken with
the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at 05:28 Mar 24 UT 
(about 7.5 hours after the burst). We found no obvious new source compared
with the DSS II (red) to a limiting magnitude of 19.0 mag. Specifically,
the candidate OT reported by Gilmore, Kilmartin, & Henden (GCN 1949) 
was outside our imaged field.
