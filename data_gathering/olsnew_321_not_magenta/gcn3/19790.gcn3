O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 160812507/492696620
at 12:10:16.58 UT on the 12th of August 2016, tentatively classified as GRB,
is in fact not due to a GRB. This trigger is due to local particles.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) by the GBM
Flight Software owing to the high fluence of the trigger. This ARR was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location."
