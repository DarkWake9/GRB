WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 220408A (Caputo et al.,
GCN 31848; see also Fermi/GBM detection, GCN 31847) starting at
06:30:47 UT, ~44 min after the burst. Observations were performed
with a sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the
exposure time was 20s per image. We did not detect the optical afterglow
reported by UVOT (Caputo et al., GCN 31848) in any of our single images.
We marginally detected the afterglow in the coadd image in clear band,
which we measured its brightness of 21.4 +/- 0.3 mag at ~53 min after the
burst, calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
