The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 15:33:56 UT on 23 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220623B (trigger 677691241.431566 / 220623649).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 216.1, Dec = 50.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 24m, 50d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 41.0 degrees.
