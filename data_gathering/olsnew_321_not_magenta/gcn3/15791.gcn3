On February 6th, 2014, Fermi LAT detected high-energy emission
from GRB 140206B, which triggered GBM at 06:36:12.84 UT
(trigger 413361375/140206275, von Kienlin et al., GCN 15790).
GBM also initiated an autonomous repoint of Fermi at 06:36:25 UT
due to high peak flux.

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be:

(RA, Dec) = 315.26, -8.51 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.23 deg (90% containment, statistical error only).
This was 45 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

More than 25 photons above 100 MeV and 2 photons above 1 GeV are observed
within 600 seconds. The highest-energy photon is a 3.5 GeV event,
which is observed 460 seconds after the GBM trigger.

Unfortunately, the GRB position is too close to the Sun  (8.2 deg)
for Swift to conduct follow-up observations.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band
from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
