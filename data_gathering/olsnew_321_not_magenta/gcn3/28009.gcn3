The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the IceCube-200620A (2020-06-20 03:03:32, GCN27997) the spacecraft was
preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2241 and 2242 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2020-06-19T22:20:06 and 2020-06-20T08:40:00.
