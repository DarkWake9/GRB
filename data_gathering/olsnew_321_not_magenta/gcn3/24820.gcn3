Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190613B (trigger #908329)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 24807).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 305.434, -4.655 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 21m 44.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -04d 39' 17.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 18%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a main pulse structure that starts
at ~T-3 s, peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+2 s. In addition, there are
some weak emissions that lasts until ~T+175 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 160.84 +- 16.83 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.85 to T+175.42 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.84 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.7 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
