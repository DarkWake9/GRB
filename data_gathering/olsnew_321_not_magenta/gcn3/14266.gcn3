B.-B. Zhang (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:51:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130306A (trigger=550457).  Swift did not slew because
of a Moon constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 279.478, -11.692 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 37m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 41' 29"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT real-time TDRSS light curve shows nothing
significant as is typical for image triggers. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:58 UT on 2013 March 08. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

We note that this burst was strongly detected by Fermi GBM
in a 4.096 second trigger at T-216 seconds (Trigger 384306448) at
a location consistent with the BAT location.  Swift was
slewing at the time of the Fermi Trigger, detecting the afterglow
of the GRB in its first 64 second image trigger after the slew ended. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. H. Siegel (siegel AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
