report:


We observed the field of GRB 030329 (HETE trigger #2652) with the
Tautenburg Schmidt telescope equipped with the prime focus CCD camera
(2k x 2k). Inspite of terrible weather conditions the afterglow
discovered by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986) is
detected in R.

Based on a comparison with the DSS2 red we can only provide a very
rough estimate of the R-band magnitude of the afterglow. The
brightness of the source is approximately R=14.8 +/- 0.5 mag. We do not
believe that we can improve the accuracy of the photometry
substantially. The quality of the images is really very bad. This
information should nevertheless help observers to plan further
observations.
