C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 201209A (GCN 29012),
at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 6.86 (+ 1.02 - 1.22 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -9.25 (+ 0.99 - 1.14 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts
below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no
counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive,
coherent search for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the
neutrino candidate time. From this search, no significant signal was found
related to IceCube-201209A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates
(arXiv:1612.02395), we report the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):

Timescale  soft     norm     hard
--------------------------------------
0.128 s:    9.3     16.     25.
1.024 s:    3.2     5.1     7.9
8.192 s:    1.3     2.0     2.4
