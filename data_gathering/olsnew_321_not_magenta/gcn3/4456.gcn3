In GCN 4455, the typical upper limit for UVOT was
quoted as about 18 while the source list was stated
as being complete to  about 19.0.

We issue a correction here. The 3sigma upper limit
estimate made at the XRT position of GRB 060109
is 19.0 while the list of sources is typically
complete to about 18th magnitude.
