S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick), M. M. Kasliwal, S. R.
Kulkarni (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the short GRB090621B (Curran et al., GCN 9545)
with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of
20 x 180 s images in the i' filter at a mean epoch of 5:37 UT on 22 June
2009 (~ 7.5 hours after the burst).

We detect the candidate afterglow reported by Levan et al. (GCN 9547) and
Galeev et al. (GCN 9549) at low significance.  Using several USNO-B
sources in the field for reference, we measure a magnitude of I ~ 22.9.
No other sources are detected inside the revised XRT error circle
(Beardmore et al., GCN 9550).

Directly comparing our P60 image with the WHT image from ~ 2 hours after
the burst (GCN 9547), we find the candidate has faded marginally by 0.5 +-
0.3 mag.  Further late-time observations will be needed to confirm if this
is the optical afterglow of GRB090621B.
