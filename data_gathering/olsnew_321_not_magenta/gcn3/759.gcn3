K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 50427 s
UT.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~10 s, a
25-100 keV fluence of ~1.5x10^-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux
over 0.5 s of 2.4x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated
this burst to two preliminary, 3 sigma error boxes whose
areas are ~65 sq. arcmin. each, and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  4 h 44 m 52.18 s     35 o 26 '   0.98 "  (CENTER)
  4 h 43 m 20.48 s     35 o  1 '  20.71 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 45 m  0.15 s     35 o 26 '  28.23 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 44 m 44.21 s     35 o 25 '  33.76 "  (CORNER)
  4 h 46 m 27.00 s     35 o 51 '  11.65 "  (CORNER)

              OR  

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  8 h 25 m 45.53 s     60 o  3 '  46.10 "  (CENTER)
  8 h 29 m 50.81 s     60 o  8 '  47.57 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 25 m 36.30 s     60 o  2 '  32.33 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 25 m 54.77 s     60 o  4 '  59.81 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 21 m 35.82 s     59 o 58 '   8.41 "  (CORNER)

These error boxes may be improved; in particular, it
may be possible to determine which is the correct box
within a few hours.
