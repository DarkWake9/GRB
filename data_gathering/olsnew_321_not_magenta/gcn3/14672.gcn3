J. Kelemen (kelemen at konkoly.hu) on behalf of the GRB OT observing program
at the Konkoly Observatory.

Starting on the evening of 15/05/2013 we observed the field of GRB 130427A
(Maselli et al., GCN 14448) 18.5435 days after the burst, using a 60/90/180 cm
Schmidt telescope located at the Mountain Station of the Konkoly
Observatory equipped with an Apogee CCD camera through R filter. On the coadded 
R images (total exp.time 1120 sec) we detected the OT and the host galaxy as
well. 
Based on the nearby UCAC-4 stars we provide 20.90 +/- 0.05 magnitude in the R
band for the OT. The brightness of the host galaxy was not subtracted.
