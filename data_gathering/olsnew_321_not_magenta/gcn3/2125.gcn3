T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE - FREGATE (UBID
10896)  observed this GRB at 13066 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it
had a duration of approximately 30 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  5.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
5.2E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 157.362, 40.758 degrees, whose radius is 21.165 +/-  0.172
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
