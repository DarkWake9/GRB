Jason X. Prochaska (UCSC), Ryan Foley (UCB), Daniel Perley (UCB), and
Thea Steele (UCB) on behalf of GRAASP reports:

"We observed the afterglow of GRB 070125 with the Kast
dual spectrometer for 4800s total starting at UT 05:41
under variable conditions.  Our low-resolution
spectrum covers 3400-8000A and reveals no significant absorption
or emission lines.   We place these constraints on the
redshift (in order of descending confidence):

(1) The absence of a Lyman limit implies z<2.7.
(2) The absence of a damped Lya profile or obvious Lya forest
implies z<1.8.
(3) The absence of obvious MgII absorption implies z<0.4.

Further analysis is in progress."
