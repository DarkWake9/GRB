of the Swift Team:

At 11:22:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a flare from a position consistent with V* CC Eri (trigger=331821). 
Swift slewed immediately to the location. The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 38.602, -43.797 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 34m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = -43d 47' 47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with image triggers, the promptly
available BAT light curve does not show significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:25:20.0 UT, 147.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright X-ray source located at RA, Dec
38.5904, -43.7971 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 02h 34m 21.69s
   Dec(J2000) = -43d 47' 49.5"
with an uncertainty of 5.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 30 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position is consistent with the catalogued position of 
2RXP J023422.2-434751 = CC Eri.
