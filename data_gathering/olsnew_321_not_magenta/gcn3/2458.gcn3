A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Konus - Wind, Mars Odyssey - HEND, and INTEGRAL - SPI-ACS observed this
~30 s long burst at 22050 s.   We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)= 351.816, -4.427 degrees, whose
radius is 73.774 +/-  0.086 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus
ecliptic latitude response limits the arrival direction to ecliptic
latitudes above 50 degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus
north of RA, Decl = 282, +27 degrees and 24, +65 degrees.

This localization may be improved, but a small error box cannot be
derived for this burst.
