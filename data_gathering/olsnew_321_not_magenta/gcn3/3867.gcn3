TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3867
SUBJECT: GRB 050824: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    05/08/25 01:58:31 GMT
FROM:    Brad Schaefer at LSU  <schaefer@grb.phys.lsu.edu>

B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), Fang Yuan (U Mich), and K. Alatalo
(Berkeley)  report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 050824 (Swift trigger 151905), producing images beginning
7.1 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first
image at 23:22:02.1 UT, 585.8 s after the burst, under good conditions
although with the gibbous Moon only 25 degrees away. We took 10 5-sec, 10
20-sec and 130 60-sec eposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated
relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe,
Turkey, also responded, producing images beginning 5.8 s after the GCN
notice time. An automated response took the first image at 23:22:00.8 UT,
584.5 s after the burst, under good conditions (but again, with the
gibbous Moon nearby). We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 80 60-sec eposures.
These unfiltered images are also calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma error circle, for both single images and coadding into sets of 10. 
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 15.4-17.0; we set 
the following specific limits.

In particular, we do not see the new source described by Gorosabel et al. 
(GCN 3865), with this source being near or below our detection threshold.
