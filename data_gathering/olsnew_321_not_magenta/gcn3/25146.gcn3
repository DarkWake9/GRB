A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 190724A has been detected
by Fermi (GBM trigger 585621841) and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far,
at about 2637 s UT (00:43:57).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=206.373 deg (13h 45m 29s)  Dec(2000)=+50.590 deg (+50d 35' 22"),
whose radius is 51.149 +/- 3.567 deg (3 sigma).

This annulus is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the Fermi GBM
localization (The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 25142)

This annulus may be improved.
