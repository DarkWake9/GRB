"We observed the field centered on the XRT position of the Swift burst
GRB 050128 (GCN#2991) with the VLA on February 8.53 UT at a frequency
of 8.46 GHz. There are no bright radio sources (>150 microJy) within

microJy (rms=31 uJy) within the 8-arcsec XRT error circle.

No further observations are planned."
