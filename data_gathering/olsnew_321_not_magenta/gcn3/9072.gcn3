Subject: GRB 090331: Fermi GBM detection



A. Camero-Arranz (NASA; FECYT) and C. Wilson-Hodge (NASA/MSFC), 
report  on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:



"At 16:20:20.39 UT on 03 31 09, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 
triggered and located GRB 090331 ( trigger 260209222/ 090331681). The on-
ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is  
RA = 212.38,   Dec = -0.51 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 
14h 09m, -00d 31' ), with  a  statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees 
(radius, 1-sigma containment,  statistical only; there is additionally a 
systematic error which is currently  estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight  is 40 degrees. Since  the source 
is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
