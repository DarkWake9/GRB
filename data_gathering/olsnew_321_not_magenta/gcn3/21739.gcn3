report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:


During the commissioning phase, at 2017-08-26T19:38:58.00 (T0),
Insight-HXMT detected GRB 170826B (trigger ID: HEB170826818)
in a routine search of the data, which was also observed by
Fermi/GBM (Poolakkil et al, GCN Circ.21717).


The Insight-HXMT light curve consists of multiple pulses
with a duration (T90) of 10.12 s measured from T0-0.46s.
The 500-ms peak rate, measured from T0-0.46 s, is 2948.6 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 23373.3 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.


The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.00 to T0+9.00 s is
adequately fit by a Power Law model with spectral index = -2.03 +/- 0.04 . 
The energy fluence is (1.46 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 5000 keV in 
this time interval.


The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.


Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
