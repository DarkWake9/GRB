P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASI/ASDC & INAF/OAR) report on behalf of the REM team: 

We observed the field of GRB 150203A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 17377) with the 60-cm robotic telescope
REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 04:10:09 UT, 62 seconds 
after the GRB, and were carried out simultaneously with in the g, r, i, z and H bands.

No source is detected at the X-ray afterglow position reported by Evans et al. (GCN 17384). 
At a mean t-t0 of 181 s, we obtain the following 3sigma upper limits: 

g > 17.8 mag
r > 17.7 mag
i > 17.5 mag
H > 17.5 mag

All magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic reddening. 
The photometry is calibrated against the APASS (optical) and 2MASS (NIR) catalogues.
