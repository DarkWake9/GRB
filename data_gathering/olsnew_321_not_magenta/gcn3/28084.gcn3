Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200711A
(trigger #981957) (Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 28078).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 285.975, -0.134 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 03m 53.9s
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 08' 04.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 8%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that
starts at ~T-5 s and ends at ~T+30 s. The three major peaks occur
at ~T0, ~T+5 s, and ~T+20 s, respectively. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 29.39 +- 3.07 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.72 to T+29.73 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.42 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.20 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 7.7 +- 1.0 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
