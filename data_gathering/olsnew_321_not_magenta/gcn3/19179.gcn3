Kugel F., Rinner C. (Observatoire Chante-Perdrix, Dauban),
and Klotz A. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP) report:

F. Kugel imaged the field of GRB 160313A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 678929) with the D=40cm F/D=3 telescope
located at the Observatoire Chante-Perdrix, Dauban,
France (IAU station A77). The CCD camera is
ARTEMIS ATIK-460ex, no optical filter is used.

The observations started 17.4 min after the GRB trigger.

The first image is 60 second exposure.
No optical transcient is detected in the XRT
error box published by Goad et al. (GCNC 19174).
Next images are co-added:

t1(min) t2(min)  Rmag_lim
17.4    18.4     19.5
17.4    42.4     20.0

Magnitudes were estimated with nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
