"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 050525A (GCN3466 ; Swift BAT Trigger time is 00:02:53 UT)
with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope
at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 12:05:50 UT on May.25.
After co-adding a set of 73 images (12:05:50 - 14:26:49 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than
17.7 mag at the position reported by Rykoff et al.(GCN 3468)
