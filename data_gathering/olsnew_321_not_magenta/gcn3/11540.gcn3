E. Berger (Harvard), A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), R. Chornock (Harvard), and
N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report:

"In addition to the spectroscopic observations reported in GCN #11538 we
also obtained i-band imaging of the afterglow candidate of GRB 110106B found
with the WHT (GCN #11534) with Gemini-N / GMOS.  A total of 900 sec were
obtained on source at a mean epoch of 2011 Jan 7.347 UT (10.89 hours after
the burst and 7.64 hours after the WHT observation).  Digital image
subtraction of the Gemini and WHT observations reveals a fading source
located at (J2000):

RA = 08:56:37.267
DEC = +47:00:10.49

with an uncertainty of about 0.2" in each coordinate.  This position is
about 1.5" due east of the galaxy noted in GCN #11534, whose redshift is
0.618 (GCN #11538).  At this redshift the corresponding projected offset is
about 10 kpc.  We note that emission is still detected at the position of
the afterglow, indicating that an association with an underlying host
unrelated to the nearby galaxy may still be possible."
