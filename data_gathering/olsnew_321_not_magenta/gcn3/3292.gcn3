TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3292
SUBJECT: GRB050418: Null Optical Observations
DATE:    05/04/18 21:28:56 GMT
FROM:    Aaron Price at AAVSO  <aaronp@aavso.org>

B. Monard and A. Price report on behalf of the AAVSO International High
Energy Network on optical observations of the field of GRB050418 (Sakamoto
et al,; GCN #3288).

Observations by Monard do not reveal ay new source compared with the
POSS-II red plates down to an unfiltered limiting magnitude of 16 at an
observation midpoint time of 16:50 (UT). As previously reported in GCN
#3288, the field was relatively close to the Sun therefore close to the
horizon.

Details of the observation are below.

Report: the observed star field was centered on 02h 57m 22s -18d 32' 15"
(2000). The obtained deep image was compared visually to a DSS-2 red image
centered on the above coordinates.

No new object showed in the quoted error box down to a magnitude of 16CR.

Note: The actual observation period was very short due to the
circumstances and no further observations were possible.
