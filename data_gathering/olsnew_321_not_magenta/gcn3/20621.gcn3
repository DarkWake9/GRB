M. Ageron (CPPM/CNRS), B. Baret (APC/CNRS), A. Coleiro (APC/Universite Paris Diderot), D. Dornic (CPPM/CNRS), A. Kouchner (APC/Universite Paris Diderot), T. Pradier (IPHC/Universite de Strasbourg) report on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration:

The ANTARES Collaboration has reported in GCN 20487, no up-going muon neutrino candidate event within the 90% contour during a +/- 500s time-window centered on the G270580 event time.

The preliminary upper limit for high-energy neutrino spectral fluence (numu+anumu) as a function of the source direction assuming a E^{-2} neutrino spectrum i, and the 90% C.L. skymap contour of G270580, is reported in https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events/G270580_fluenceE2.png (gwantares/ANT@GW). These neutrino fluence limits range between 1 and 3 GeV/cm^{2} depending on the source direction. 

As no 3D GW localization skymap is provided,  no upper limits on the total energy radiated in high-energy neutrinos can be computed for the progenitor of G270580.

ANTARES, being installed in the Mediterranean Deep Sea, is the largest neutrino detector in the Northern Hemisphere.  It is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range.  At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is below 0.5 degrees.  In the range 1-100 TeV, ANTARES has the best sensitivity to a large fraction of the Southern sky.
