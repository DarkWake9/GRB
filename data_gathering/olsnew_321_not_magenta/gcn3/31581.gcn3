Y.-D. Hu, F. Aceituno, T.-R. Sun, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M. D. Caballero-Garcia, R. Sanchez-Ramirez and E. Fernandez-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 220210A by Fermi (Fermi Team, GCNC 31568), Swift (Tohuvavohu et al. GCNC 31572) and AGILE (Ursi et al. GCNC 31575), we triggered the 1.5m OSN telescope in Granada (Spain) starting on Feb 11 at 19:30 UT (i.e. ~19.6 h post burst). Five images covering the Swift/BAT-GUANO error region were taken in the I-band at high airmass. No optical afterglow is detected in the error box down to I=20.8 in the combined (5x300s) image, in agreement with the non-detections reported by Lipunov et al. (GCNC 31569) and Carrasco-Garcia et al. (GCNC 31574).

We thank the staff at OSN for their excellent support.
