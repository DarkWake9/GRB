A. Smette (ESO Chile) reports:

The Mini  All-Sky Cloud Observation Tool (MASCOT)  located at ESO's
Very Large   Telescope      Observatory, Cerro  Paranal, Chile, 
(http://www.eso.org/instruments/mascot/index.html)   obtained    90 s
images simultaneously to the CONCAM images reported  in   GCN 4995. 

Comparison   with previous MASCOT images   indicates that  there is no
optical transient at the reported location of the proposed OT060420 in
images  taken   between 2006-04-20T00:15 and    2006-04-20T00:36 UT.
Although conditions were cloudy, limiting   magnitudes are similar  to
the CONCAM images.

MASCOT images are available through the ESO archive:
