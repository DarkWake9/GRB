D. Malesani, J. P. U. Fynbo, P. M. Vreeswijk (DARK), C. Villforth (NOT), 
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 080319A (Pagani et al., GCN 7426) with the 
Nordic Optical Telescope, starting on 2008 March 19.265 UT. Exposures in 
the R and I bands were secured.

We detect the afterglow reported by Cenko (GCN 7429). Compared to the 
USNO-B1 star 1340-0249427 at RA = 13:45:26.457, Dec = +44:04:45.56 (R1 = 
15.79), we measure R = 21.03 +- 0.09 on Mar 19.27088 UT (44.4 min after 
the GRB).

A finding chart is posted at:

We acknowledge excellent support from the NOT observing staff.
