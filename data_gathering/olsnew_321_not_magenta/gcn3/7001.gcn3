FROM:    Nat Butler at MIT/CSR  <nrbutler@space.mit.edu>

P. Nugent (LBL), N. Butler, J.S. Bloom, and D. Perley (UC Berkley) report:

We have created a stacked image through the co-addition of 12 unfiltered
images taken by the NEAT collaboration and 45 images in the RG610 filter
taken by the Palomar-Quest Consortium at the Palomar Oschin Schmidt
telescope (obtained from 2001-2007), of 071025 (Pagani et al.; GCN #6986).
The stacked image is significantly deeper than the DSS (3 sigma limit of
R~22.8 mag). 

There is no source at the position of the counterpart (Rykoff et al. GCN #6987,
Covino et al. GCN #6988, Bloom et al. GCN #6989).  The image is available at 
http://www.lbl.gov/~nugent/deepsky.html
