K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

GRB030501B was detected by Konus-Wind at 01:17:21.824 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 01:17:20.607 UT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 224.210 deg,
Decl(2000) = -21.142 deg,
Radius = 81.01 +/- 0.68 degrees (3 sigma ).
This annulus intersects the IPN annulus (GCN 2186) to form two
error boxes, only one of which has the correct ecliptic latitude.
Preliminary 3 sigma error box has approximate area of 400 sq. arcmin :
