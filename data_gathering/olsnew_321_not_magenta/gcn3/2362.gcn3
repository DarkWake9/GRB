TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2362
SUBJECT: GRB030823: optical observation at Tokyo Tech
DATE:    03/08/24 05:00:32 GMT
FROM:    Nobuyuki Kawai at Tokyo Tech  <nkawai@hp.phys.titech.ac.jp>

 M. Suzuki, Y. Yatsu, Y. Kuramoto, and N. Kawai report:
 
 "We have observed the field covering the entire SXC error box of
 GRB030823 (HETE trigger 2818; trigger time 08:52:40 UT) with the
 unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope at Tokyo Tech, beginning
 at 10:43:19 UT.  We started the observation earlier than the GCN notice,
 since M.S., as a member of the HETE ops team, had access to the
 preliminary WXM ground location before its validity was evaluated.
 
 Visual inspection of the images revealed no obvious new source compared
 with the DSS 2 (red) to an approximate limiting magnitude of 16.5."
