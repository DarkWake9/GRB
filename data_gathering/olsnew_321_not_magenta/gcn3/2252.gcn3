report: 

  "We have been performing the unfiltered CCD imaging of the field of
GRB 030528 (=H2724) with a 25-cm telescope at Kyoto University,
starting at 13:07:15 UT (252 seconds after burst).  The first five
images (30 seconds exposure each) fully covered the SXC error circle
(Seq_Num 6).  The visual comparison with the DSS 2 red image revealed
no new source up to 16.0 mag (based on USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes) on
each image.  Further observation and analysis is underway.
