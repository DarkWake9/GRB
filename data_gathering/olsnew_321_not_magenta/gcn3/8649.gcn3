Using the data set from T-240 to T+651 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081210 (trigger #337073)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 8648).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 70.485, -11.263 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 41m 56.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 15' 46.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several peaks.  The first starts at
~T-30 sec.  The second and brightest peaks at ~T+18 sec.  The third peaks
at T+135 sec.  There is possible forth peak at T+180 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 146 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.9 to T+143.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.42 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+17.97 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
