behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190910h at T0 = 2019-09-10 08:29:58
(UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered
data found no event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec
from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 60% of the S190910h 90 c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained
for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the
accessible S190910h localization region, from a minimum of 1.33E-06 erg
cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.35E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a
single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
