SUBJECT: GRB 030913: ROTSE-3c Optical Observations

E. S. Rykoff and D. A. Smith, on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration report:

"The ROTSE-3c telescope at the H.E.S.S. site at Farm Goellschau, Namibia,
responded automatically to HETE-2 alert 2849 (GRB 030913) on 13 September, and
started taking images during early twilight within 7 s of the GCN notice
distribution.  Our first image with sky background low enough to perform
photometric and astrometric calibration was taken at 17:38:14.11 UTC, 31
minutes after the burst, with observations continuing for another hour.  All
exposures were 60-s in duration. Initial analysis of the revised 12' error box
reported by Donaghy, et. al (GCN 2388) revealed no new sources not present on
the Digitized Sky Survey POSS2 red plate, and no sources that varied
significantly over the duration of our observations, to an unfiltered limiting
magnitude of 17.0 mag.

Co-adding our first set of ten usable images reveals no sources not present in
the DSS to an unfiltered limiting magnitude of 19.2 mag.  In particular, the
proposed optical counterpart reported by Guziy et al. (GCN 2391) is not evident
at t_0 + 36 min to this limiting magnitude."
