M. H. Siegel (PSU) and P. A. Evans (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 170531A
3523 s after the BAT trigger (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 21170).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 21180) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
We note that the XRT position is 3.5” away from a known USNO-B1 source, which
we detect. There is no indication of a second source within the error circle.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag

w2                4298         4497          197         >19.4

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.09 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
