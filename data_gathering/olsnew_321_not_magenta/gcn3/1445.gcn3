report:

"We have obtained several images in the Sloan i'-band
filter following the detection  by HETE of GRB 020625
(Ricker et al. GCN 1442)  with the 2.5-m Isaac Newton
Telescope (+WFC) at La Palma. The observations started
16.3 hr after the event and cover  90 % of the HETE
error box. Details follow:

Date  (UT time)            Frames    Seeing   Limiting Mag
-----------------------------------------------------------
June 26, 03:42-04:22     4 x 600-s    1".8      20.5
June 27, 03:39-03:49     1 x 600-s    0".9      21.0
June 28, 23:47-00:10     2 x 600-s    1".2      21.0

No sources varying by more than 0.3 mag were seen
within the fraction of the HETE error box imaged at the INT.
This complements the upper limits given by Burnashev et al.
(GCN 1444).  Further observations are planned."
