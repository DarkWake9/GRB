collaborations

On UT 2017-03-04, we spectroscopically classified the following iPTF
optical transient candidates (LVC GCN#20801, LVC GCN#20790) using the
Double Beam Spectrograph (Oke & Gunn 1982) on the Palomar 200-inch Hale
Telescope. All spectra were reduced using the pyraf-dbsp pipeline (Bellm &
Sesar 2016). Classification were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007) and
Superfit (Howell et al. 2005).

Name, Redshift, Classification, Notes
iPTF17bug, z=0.0167, Spectrum dominated by galaxy light (Consistent with
LVC GCN 20814)
iPTF17bxk, z=0.077, SN IIn, Best match is 2005cl at +15d
iPTF17bpa, z=0.046, Spectrum dominated by host galaxy light, just outside
90% contour line (Consistent with LVC GCN 20814)
iPTF17bpb, z=0.049, Spectrum dominated by host galaxy light
iPTF17bpc, z=0.039, Spectrum dominated by host galaxy light
iPTF17bsd, z=0.116, Spectrum dominated by host galaxy light
iPTF17bro, z=0.055, Spectrum dominated by host galaxy light
iPTF17bvo, z=0.0915, AGN?, double-peaked Balmer line
