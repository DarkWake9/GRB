The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:29:49 UT on 1 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220401B (trigger 670541394.48622 / 220401896).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 352.5, Dec = 42.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 30m, 42d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 35.0 degrees.
