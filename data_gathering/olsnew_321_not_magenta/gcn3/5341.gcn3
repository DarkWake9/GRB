behalf of the MISTICI collaboration report:


We are observing the field of GRB 060719 with VLT+FORS2. The object  
reported in GCN 5340 (Berger and Bonanos) is clearly visible.

However, the same object is also well visible in the DSS frame  
(version I) while it is barely detectable in the DSS frame (version II).

Further observations are ongoing to determine its possible variability.
