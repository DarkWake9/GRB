C. Rodgers, E. Hausel, D. Allen and R. Canterna report on behalf of
the Red Buttes Observatory GRB Team as
part of the FUN GRB Collaboration. We responded to GRB 050714A (GCN 3607) at
05:11:41 UT with a series of 10 minute R and I exposures centered on
the positon of the original 
Integral GRB Position under excellent conditions. No new source was
detected after comparison with DSS.

We also responded to GRB 050716 (GCN 3623) at 2005-07-17 05:52:03 UT. 
We took a series of 5 and 10 minute
exposures in R and I with limiting magnitues of 18.6 in R and 17.4 in
I.  These observations were started 17
hours after the BAT trigger. No new source was
detected after comparison with DSS.

10 sigma limiting magnitudes were derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue
