The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:33:54 UT on 20 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201020B (trigger 624908039.329288 / 201020732).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 71.6, Dec = 76.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 46m, 76d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
