W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), and RHESSI observed
this GRB at 85272 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately  40 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
7.8E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  8.6E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 1900 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   18 h 14 m 33.50 s   -40 o 29 '  18.84 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  18 h 14 m 30.86 s    -40 o 21 '  48.19 "  
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  18 h 13 m 16.33 s    -43 o 48 '  56.36 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  18 h 16 m 13.55 s    -37 o 30 '  14.99 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  18 h 14 m 36.20 s    -40 o 36 '  51.16 "

This error box may be improved, but as Ulysses, the Earth, and
Mars are practically aligned, a small error box cannot be derived
for this event.
