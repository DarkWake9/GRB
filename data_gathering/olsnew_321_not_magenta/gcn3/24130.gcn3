We observed the localization region of the short GRB190406B (trigger
576241792) detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi
satellite with the Palomar 48 inch telescope equipped with the 47 square
degree Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera. We obtained a series of r-
and g-band images covering 268 square degrees beginning at 08:01 UT on 2019
April 08 (44:52 hours after the burst trigger time). This corresponds to ~
44% of the probability enclosed in the intersection of the GBM and IPN
localization regions. We revisited the region on 2019 April 11, starting at
08:03 UT (116:54 hours after the burst trigger time) and we covered the
same ~ 44% of the probability region.

The images were processed through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction
pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts. 240
high-significance transient and variable candidates were identified by our
pipeline in the area observed, 236 of which had previous detections with
ZTF in the days and weeks prior to the GRB trigger time (e.g., supernovae,
active galactic nuclei).

Further follow-up of 4 transients was obtained with the Kitt Peak EMCCD
Demonstrator (KPED) on the Kitt Peak 84-inch telescope on April 12.
Additionally, we obtained follow-up spectroscopy of 2 candidates with the
Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on Palomar 200‚Äù the nights of April 12. The
candidates are listed below, however no photometric evolution or spectral
classification was consistent with an optical counterpart.
