P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), B.P. Gompertz (U. Leicester), V. D'Elia
(ASDC), M. de Pasquale (INAF-IASFPA), A. Maselli  (INAF-IASFPA), V.
Mangano (PSU), M.C. Stroh (PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U.
Leicester) and T.N. Ukwatta report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 141212A (Ukwatta  et al.
GCN Circ. 17158),  from 77 s to 28.9 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT
position for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 17164).

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.62 (+0.20, -0.16).


If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.62, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 7.6 x 10^-4 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
