P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift began observing the field of GRB 140729A (Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 16633; Stanbro, GCN Circ. 16636) on 2014-07-29 at 10:12  UT, 34.5 ks after the LAT trigger (Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 16633). A tiled observation of four contiguous fields centered on the LAT coordinates has been secured. The total integration time is 3.8 ks, i.e., about 1 ks per field. Our mosaic covers about 90% of the LAT error circle (Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 16633)  and about 50% of the observed area lies within the IPN error localization, published after our observation began (Hurley et al. GCN Circ 16637).

In the XRT exposure, we do not find any new source, down to a three sigma upper limit of 9e-03 cts/s. 

UVOT observed the four fields using the U filter. No new source was found down to a 90%-confidence upper limit of about 20.0 mag. No correction is made for the Galactic extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
