the Swift Team:

At 15:12:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and 
located GRB 060714 (trigger=219101).   Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
227.872, -6.546 (15h 11m 29s, -06d 32' 45") (J2000) 
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak with a
duration ~20 seconds. The peak count rate was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV). 

The XRT began observing the field at 15:13:39 UT, 99 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) = 15h 11m 26.5s, Dec(J2000) = -06d 33' 57.5", with an
estimated uncertainty of 4.7 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). 
This location is 83 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within
the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image was
1.0e-08 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 109 seconds after the BAT trigger. There
is a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image
at (RA,DEC) (J2000) of (227.8602,-6.5662) or
(15h11m26.45s,-06o33'58.3")  with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5
arc sec. This position is 2.0 arc sec. from the center of the XRT
error circle. The estimated magnitude is 19.2 with a 1-sigma error of
about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of  0.08.
