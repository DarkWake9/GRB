L. P. Singer (NASA/GSFC), M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie Observatories/Princeton),
and S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory (iPTF) collaboration:

Using the Palomar 48-inch Oschin telescope (P48) and the robotic 60-inch
telescope (P60), we have continued observing the optical transients that
we reported (Singer et al., GCN 17415) in connection with GRB 140206B
(Burns & Yu, GCN 17417). At about 20 hours after the burst, all three of
the candidates (iPTF15gz, iPTF15hb, and iPTF15gv) are still clearly
detected in host-subtracted images, despite relatively coarse 3" seeing.
They show no statistically significant fading. We therefore dismiss them
as counterparts of the GRB.
