The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

We have completed offline calibration and re-analysis of the segment of
data containing the gravitational-wave trigger G211117, which was first
recovered on 2015-12-26 (GCN 18728).

We have calculated a revised false alarm rate based on two detection
pipelines, the PyCBC and GSTLAL offline searches for compact binary
coalescences of neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black holes. Both
pipelines estimate that G211117 is more significant (less likely to be
produced by noise) than one per hundred years.
