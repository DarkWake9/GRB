We observed the field of GRB 160225A (Siegel, et al., GCN 19075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/02 26.13 to 2016/02 26.28 UTC (12.72 to
16.34 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.47 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.04 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We detect the WHT afterglow candidate (Wiersema, et al., GCN 19082), and
find it to have faded.  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs,
we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 24.09
  i = 23.03 +/- 0.16
  Z = 22.17 +/- 0.19
  Y > 22.35
  J = 22.06 +/- 0.33
  H > 21.74

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The r-band faintness suggests that
this may be a moderate to high-z source.  Fitting Milky Way, LMC, and SMC
Exctinction Laws in Addition to the IGM (see, Littlejohns, et al. 2014), we
find a photo-z of 5.54 (+0.35,-5.11; 90% conf.).  Hence, a high-z solution
is preferred, but a low-z origin is not ruled out.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
