The bright GRB 201116A (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: The Fermi
GBM team, GCN Circ. 28897; BALROG localization: Kunzweiler et al.,

Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:49:45.039 UTC on 16 November 2020
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1289522797/).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked pulse which starts at T+2.6
sec, peaks at T+7.9 sec, and ends at T+12.4 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 6.5 +- 0.6 sec and 3.0 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000
keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
