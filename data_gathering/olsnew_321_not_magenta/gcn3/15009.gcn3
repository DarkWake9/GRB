We continue to observe the optical counterpart of the Fermi GRB 130702A 
( Singer et al. GCN 14967; Collazzi et al. GCN 14972 ) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at  13:42:16.031 UT on 16 July, 2013 
under a bad weather.  6*300 sec  R-band images were obtained. 
The brightness of the optical afterglow was found with a magnitude 
of  R~19.6 +/-0.2 mag,  calibrated by USNO-B 1.0 R2 mag of the two stars
 (Schulze et al. GCN 14978; Pozanenko et al. GCN 15003),  
at the mean time of 14.57 days after the burst.
