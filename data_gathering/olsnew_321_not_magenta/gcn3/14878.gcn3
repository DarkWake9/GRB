report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 130612A (Racusin et al., GCN
14874; Melandri et al., GCN 14875) using the 2.5-m Nordic Optical
Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. We obtained 4x300s
R-band images with a median time 04:06:09 UT on 12 June 2013 (i.e.
0.73 hr after the burst).

The optical afterglow was clearly detected with R ~ 20.3 mag
calibrated with nearby stars in the USNO B1 catalog.
