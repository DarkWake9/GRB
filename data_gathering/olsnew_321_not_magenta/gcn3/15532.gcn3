U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131127A detected 
by SWIFT(trigger 00579571) with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy (www.osservatoriobassano.org).

The observations started 9h 2m. after the 
GRB trigger,with our schmidt telescope 
D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added a series of 5 exposures of 120 sec each.

We did not found any optical counterpart 
in the error box of the XRTcandidate
(Markwardt et al., GCN 15516).
