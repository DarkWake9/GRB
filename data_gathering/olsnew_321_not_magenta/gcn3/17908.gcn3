T. Kruehler (ESO) & A. A. Djupvik (NOT) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150607A (D'Elia et al., GCN 17904) using
the Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with the ALFOSC camera.

A short series of photometry in BVRI filters was taken starting at
2015-06-07 21:43UT. The optical afterglow (D'Elia et al., GCN 17094) of
GRB 150607A is well detected in our images. We measure R = 21.6 +/- 0.2
mag at 13.76 hours after the trigger, calibrated against magnitudes
of nearby stars from the USNO-B1 catalog.
