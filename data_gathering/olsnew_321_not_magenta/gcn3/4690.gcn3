W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

We began observations of the error box of GRB 060206 reported
by Morris et al. (GCN 4682) with the robotic 0.76-m Katzman
Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory at about
3.9 hours after the burst, and the afterglow reported by Fynbo
et al. (GCN 4683) was clearly detected in all the images. The
afterglow is at magnitude 17.95 +/- 0.05 (calibrated to USNO
B1.0) in a 120s unfiltered image started at 08:41:52 UT (3.92
hours after the burst).  A finder chart of the afterglow can 
be found at http://astron.berkeley.edu/~weidong/grb060206.gif .
