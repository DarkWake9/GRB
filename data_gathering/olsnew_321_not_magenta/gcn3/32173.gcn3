Leicester), A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst GRB 220606B (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN
Circ. 32167), collecting 4.9 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data
between T0+44.9 ks and T0+68.8 ks. 

No credible X-ray afterglow candidate has been detected within the
BAT-GUANO error circle (Tohuvavohu, GCN Circ. 32170) down to a 0.3 - 10
keV count-rate upper limit of ~ 2e-3 ct/s (3sigma c.l.).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021504.

Swift-UVOT began settled observations 45.1 ks after the trigger. No
optical afterglow consistent with the BAT-GUANO position is detected.
The 3.9 ks exposure in the white filter gives an upper limit of >21.9
mag.
