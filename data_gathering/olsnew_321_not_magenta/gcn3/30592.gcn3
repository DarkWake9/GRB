Y.-D. Hu, T.-R. Sun, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga), R. Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC) and M. Jelinek (ASU-CAS), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Fermi trigger of GRB 210802A (Longo GCNC 30589, Roberts et al. GCNC 30590), we triggered the 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) after the twilight as soon as it was possible. Useful images were taken only after 20:12 UT on 03 Aug (~1 day after trigger). In the co-added 12 x 60 s exposure image (clear filter), no optical afterglow is detected within the X-ary afterglow position reported by XRT/Swift (Sbarufatti et al. GCNC 30591) down to 20.3 mag.

We thank the staff at La Mayora for its excellent support.
