B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), D. N. Burrows (PSU), J. L. Racusin
(NASA/GSFC), C. J. Mountford (U Leicester), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report
on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift performed 3 pointings of 1.5 ks each to cover the IPN error box for
GRB 130310A (Golenetskii et al., GCN #14284). A single, uncatalogued
source is detected at coordinates:

   RA/Dec (J2000) = 09 27 36.35   -17 06 16.1
   RA/Dec (J2000) = 141.901   -17.1044

Error radius (arcsec) = 3.6 (90% confidence level)

The source is inside the IPN error box, and 0.44 degrees from the Fermi
LAT position (Guiriec et al., GCN #14282), just inside the LAT error
circle.

The countrate is 7.60E-03 +/- 2.5E-03 c/sec
At present is not possible to tell if the source is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
