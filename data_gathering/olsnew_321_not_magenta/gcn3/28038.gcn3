S.Dichiara (UMD, NASA-GSFC), B. O'Connor (GWU, UMD) , E. Troja (UMD,
NASA-GSFC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained a spectrum of the putative host galaxy (Fong et al., GCN Circ.
27779; Strausbaugh et al., GCN Circ. 27792) of the short GRB 200522A (Evans
et al., GCN Circ. 27778) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted
on the Gemini North telescope.  Observations began at 13:22 UT on June 27,
2020 (36 days after the Swift trigger) and cover the wavelength range from
5000-9900 A.

The spectra shows several well detected emission lines which we interpret
as [OII] 3727, H-beta, and [OIII] 5007 at a common redshift of z=0.554.

We thank the Gemini North staff for efficiently executing these
observations in these difficult times.
