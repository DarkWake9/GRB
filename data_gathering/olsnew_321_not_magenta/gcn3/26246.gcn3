triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 15:19:06.826 UTC
on 27 October 2019. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a FRED-like pulse which starts at T+0.6 sec,
peaks at T+0.9 sec and ends at T+3.0 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 1.9 +- 0.6 sec and 0.6 +- 0.3 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
