Y.T. Chen, Y.L. Wu, K-Y. Huang, W-H. Ip(NCU), 
Y. Urata (RIKEN) on behalf of EAFON report: 

" We have observed entire error region of GRB 051016B (Parsons et 
al. GCN 4103) with 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory, 
Taiwan. Compare with DSS-2 images, we find a source in the 
Swift/XRT error region. The position is RA=08:48:27.81 
DEC=+13:39:20.0. The source do not show significant variability during 
our observational period (1.5-2 hours after the burst).  These 3-sigma 
limiting magnitudes derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalog are R=21.5. 

This message may be cited."
