A. Henden (USRA/USNO), J. Hambsch (VVS/AAVSO), E. Broens (VVS/AAVSO) report:

We have imaged the entire error circle of GRB021219
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 1766; Gotz et al., GCN 1768)
with the following results:

     UTD     dt(burst) tele   exp   filt  condx  lim_mag
   021219.78  11hr     0.4m  8x5min  Rc   poor   18.0
   021220.06  18hr     1.0m  12min   Ic   poor   19.5

Comparison with the DSS-2 F and N plates show only a few objects
near the plate limit that may or may not be real, but no new
bright object.  No galaxies are seen; at galactic longitude 61.8
and latitude +14, this field is relatively close to the galactic plane.
No additional observations are planned.
