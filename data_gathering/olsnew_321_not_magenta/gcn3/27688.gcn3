During the ToO observation to SGR 1935+2154, Insight-HXMT/HE detected
a short (~0.2 s) and bright burst at 2020-05-03 23:25:13.4 UT
(satellite time), which was also detected by Fermi/GBM (trigNum 610241118)
and AGILE (GCN #27687). According to the relative rates in 17 detectors
of HE (20-250 keV), this burst is consistent as from SGR 1935+2154.

The HE light curve consists of two major bumps with a
separation time of ~50 ms, and a relatively weaker but narrower peak,
which is similar to the FRB-associated burst at 14:34:24.5 UT of April 28
(GCN 27675, Atel #13687, Atel #13696) but with a much higher peak flux.

The HE light curves have been corrected for data saturation
caused by the extreme brightness of this burst in HE.
HE detectors are divided into 3 groups, i.e. PDAU 0, PDAU 1 and PDAU 2.
Each group consists of 6 detectors and has implemented data saturation
correction separately. The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve could be found at:

After receiving the ME (5-30 keV) and LE (1-10 keV) data, more analysis
results will be reported.
