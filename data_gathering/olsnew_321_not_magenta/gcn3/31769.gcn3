K. L. Page (U Leicester), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J.D. Gropp (PSU),
J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (U Tampa), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) report on behalf of the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 17:40:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220319A (trigger=1098132).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 218.207, +61.289 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 14h 32m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 17' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 17:42:14.5 UT, 101.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 218.22471, 61.29389 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 14h 32m 53.93s
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 17' 38.0"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 35 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
317 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.010.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
