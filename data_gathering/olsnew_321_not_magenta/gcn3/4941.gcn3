Swift observed the field of the HETE II transient H4043
(Fenimore et al. 2006, GCN 4938) on 2006 March 31
for three consecutive orbits starting at 16:53 UT.
About 65% of the HETE error box was covered in two
different pointings with 1500 and 500 s exposure, respectively.
No point source was detected up to limiting fluxes of about
5.e-13 and 1.3.e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, respectively.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
