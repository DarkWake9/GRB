Leicester), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

INTEGRAL detected GRB050714 at 00:05:56 UT on July 14th 2005 (GCN Circ 
3607).  The Swift observatory executed a Target of Opportunity observation 
of the INTEGRAL position and the XRT began taking data at 13:46:16 UT, 
13.7 hours after the burst.  In preliminary ground processing of the data, 
we detect an uncatalogued apparently fading X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 02 54 21.9,
Dec(J2000) = +69 06 43

We estimate an uncertainty of 9 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 52 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position reported in GCN 
3607.
