A.Pozanenko (IKI), S.Bondar' (Kosmoten),  G.Beskin  (SAO) and V.  Rumyantsev
(CrAO)  report:

We have observed the entire error box of GRB020812 with 600mm automated
telescope TT600 of Kosmoten observatory. Observation started after HETE
Ground Analysis (HETE 2257,  Seq_Num: 3). Unfiltered mosaic images were
obtained on Aug 12 between 18:52  - 18:55 (UT) with image exposure of 2.56
sec. Limiting magnitude of the observation is about 16.5.

We have found a new object, which is not present on DSS.
The coordinates of the object are:

RA=  20h38m51s  DEC= -05o31'14" (J2000)

with uncertainty of  4" in both coordinates.
Using USNO-A2.0 we estimate brightness of the object about 14.5 m.
We have no images taken later, so the nature of the object in unclear.

This message is citeable.
