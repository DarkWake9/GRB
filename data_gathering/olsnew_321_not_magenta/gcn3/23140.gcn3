We correct a typo in GCN 23137: The 0.5-8 keV count rate measured in the 
10 August 2018 Chandra observation of GW170817 should have read 4.9 
(+0.9/-0.9) e-04 ct/s. All fluxes, photon indices, luminosities, light 
curve slopes, etc., reported in GCN 23137 are correct, and were derived 
from this correct count rate.

GCN OPS NOTE(28aug18):  Per author's request, the Subject-line
was corrected with the proper referencing Subject-line.]
