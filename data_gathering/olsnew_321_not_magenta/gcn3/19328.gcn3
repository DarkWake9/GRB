Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160419A (trigger #683383)
(Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 19326).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 16.418, -27.341 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  01h 05m 40.3s
  Dec(J2000) = -27d 20' 28.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 16%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a triangle-shaped, single-peaked structure
that starts at ~ T-4 s, peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T0+8 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 8.8 +- 1.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.5 to T+8.5 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.76 +- 0.33,
and Epeak of 107.1 +- 35.2 keV (chi squared 40.46 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
8.9 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.40 +- 0.07 (chi squared 53.01 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
