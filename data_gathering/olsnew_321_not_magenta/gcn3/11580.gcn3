A. Zauderer (Harvard), D.A. Frail (NRAO), E. Berger (Harvard), and S.R.
Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

We observed the position of the intermediate-duration GRB 110106A
(GCN #11520) with the CARMA millimeter array starting on 2011 Jan.
16.827 UT (84 min after the burst) at a frequency of 92 GHz.
A total of 32 minutes were spent integrating on
source in good weather conditions (tau230 < 0.1).  With baselines up
to ~1 km, we obtain a beam size of 3.3'' x 0.9'' (natural weighting).
We do not detect any sources within the revised XRT position
(GCN#11526) to a 5-sigma upper limit of 4.1 mJy/beam.
These observations are among the earliest millimeter wavelength
afterglow searches at milliJansky noise levels.

We thank the CARMA staff for their support of these observations.
