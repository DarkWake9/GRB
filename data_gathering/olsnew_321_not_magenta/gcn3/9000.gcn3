A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) and A.P. Kamble (University of
Amsterdam) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 090313 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at March 14 21.06 UT to March 15
7.27 UT, i.e. 1.50 - 1.92 days after the burst (GCN 8980).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 8979). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around that position is
114 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
position of the optical counterpart is 26 +/- 38 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
