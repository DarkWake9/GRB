NUMBER:  2270

D. A. Frail (NRAO) and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2003 June 3.32 UT we used the VLA to image the 2.5-arcmin error
circle of the HETE SXC of GRB 030528 (GCN#2261). A 15-minute
integration was taken at a frequency of 8.46 GHz with the VLA in the
A-array configuration, producing a synthesized beam of 0.5" x 0.25".

There are no sources in the SXC error circle above a level of 350 uJy
(about 5-sigma). We have made a deeper search in the vicinity of the
four Chandra X-ray sources (GCN#2269) but we find no significant
(>3-sigma) detections."
