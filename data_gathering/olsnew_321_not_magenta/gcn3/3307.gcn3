Starting with the data taken ~245s after the BAT trigger (Barbier
et al., GCN 3296) we have co-added the early time data of GRB 050421
in each of the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) V, B and U
bands. The co-added images are made up of 9 x 10s exposures. No
source is detected within the revised XRT error circle (Godet et al.,
GCN 3301) in any of the bands; we estimate the five sigma magnitude
upper limits from the co-added images to be:

Filter Upper limit

V      17.5
B      19.1
U      18.8

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
