G. G. Williams (MMTO) and P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory), on behalf of
the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box of
GRB 071011 (Swift Trigger 293924, Marshall et al. GCN 6882) at 12:40:53.4 UT,
40.4 seconds after the trigger.  Our initial observations include 5 x 10s
exposures, 5 x 20s exposures, and 30 x 60s exposures, all in the R-band.

The observations occurred during morning twilight at a starting airmass
of 2.16.  In our earliest exposure, we do not detect the afterglow
candidate reported by Perley (GCN 6883) and confirmed by Iizuka (GCN 6886)
or any other candidates in the BAT error circle to the following
3-sigma limiting magnitude determined from nearby USNO-B1.0 stars:

t_start (UT)    exp t (s)       t_start-t_0 (s) Limit
--------------------------------------------------------
12:40:53.4      10.0            40.4            R > 16.90

Subsequent exposures also do not reveal any additional candidates.
Analysis is ongoing.
