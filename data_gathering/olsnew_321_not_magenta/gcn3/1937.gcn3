A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, HETE (FREGATE), RHESSI, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)
observed this GRB at 52320 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 3 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  4.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
2.4E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 345.309, -42.142 degrees, whose radius is 70.420 +/-  0.016
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as this event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
