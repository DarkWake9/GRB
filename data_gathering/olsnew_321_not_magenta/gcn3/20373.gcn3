Following GCN #20364 on the possible GW event G258556, we observed part of
its sky localization region with Mini-MegaTORTORA nine-channel wide-field
monitoring system (located at Special Astrophysical Observatory near
Russian 6-m telescope) starting on 2017-01-04 18:32:48 UT (8.3 hours since
trigger) under moderate weather conditions.

The system field of view has been centered on RA, Dec = 136, 54 covering
roughly 900 square degrees simultaneously. This covers about 30% of the
probability in the BAYESTAR map.
Coverage map of all nine channels is shown at

Every channel acquired 10 x 60s exposure images in white light between
2017-01-04 18:32:48 UT and 2017-01-04 18:41:50 UT. The footprints of
acquired images are uploaded to GraceDB.

Quick-look analysis did not reveal any transient brighter than V~14.5
magnitude in the data.
