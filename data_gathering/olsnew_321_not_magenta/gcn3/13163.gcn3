"At 06:26:20.95 UT on 28 March 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120328B (trigger 354608782 / 120328268).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the IPN error box
(Hurley at al., GCN 13157).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 30.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+3.072 s to T0+34.816 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 177.90 (+4.35/-4.16) keV,
alpha = -0.75 +/-0.02, and beta = -2.00 +/-0.02
(CSTAT 1669.1 for 721 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.74 +/- 0.02)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.95 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 33.5 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
