The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:45:47 UT on 17 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210917A (trigger 653543152.223672 / 210917157).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 75.5, Dec = -36.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 01m, -36d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.
