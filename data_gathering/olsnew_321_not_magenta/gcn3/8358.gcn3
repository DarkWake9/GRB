J. A. Kennea and D. Grupe (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT Team

We have analyzed downlinked data from the XRT observations of GRB 081011 
(Grupe et al, GCN #8355). The XRT began observing the field at 00:30:24.4 
UT, 94 seconds after the BAT trigger. Data from the first orbit of 
observations reveal an uncatalogued fading point source at RA, Dec = 
220.34435, +33.544771 which is the equivalent to:

RA(J2000) = 14h 41m 22.6s
Dec(J2000) = +33d 32m 41.1s

with an estimated uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% confidence). 
This position is 57 arcseconds from the BAT refined position (Sakamoto et 
al, GCN #8357).
