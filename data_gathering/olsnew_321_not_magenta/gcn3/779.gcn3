K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed this burst at 85793 s UT.  As 
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~9 s, a 25-100 keV fluence
of ~5.2x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of ~1.3x10^-6
erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated this burst to a preliminary,
3 sigma error box with area ~38 sq. arcmin., whose 
coordinates are:


    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 23 h 34 m 12.08 s      6 o 20 '  47.07 "  (CENTER)
 23 h 34 m 22.60 s      6 o 20 '  31.35 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 33 m 41.31 s      6 o 14 '  35.26 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 34 m 42.79 s      6 o 27 '   0.40 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 34 m  1.57 s      6 o 21 '   2.92 "  (CORNER)
              OR  

This error box may be improved.
