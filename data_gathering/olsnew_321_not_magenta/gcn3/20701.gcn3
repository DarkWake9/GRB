We observed a 49 square degree of the probability area of G274296 using a
wide-field 0.25m telescope (a piggyback system on the 0.8m telescope) at
the McDonald observatory, Texas, USA. The observation was performed in
R-band, starting at 2017-02-18 11:27 (UT). A preliminary analysis of the
data shows the detection limit of  R ~ 17.8 mag at 5-sigma for a point
source detection. The covered fields are indicated below, each having a
2.35 deg x 2.35 deg field of view centered at the coordinates. The central
parts of the fields are covered by the 0.8m telescope simultaneously,
covering 46.2 arcmin x 46.2 arcmin field of view to the depths about 0.7
magnitude deeper than the 0.25m data. The analysis of the data is ongoing.
