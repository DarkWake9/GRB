report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-03-05T13:05:19.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190305A (trigger ID: HEB190305545) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by AGILE/MCAL (Ursi et al., GCN23930), 
CALET/CGBM and MAXI/GSC (Nakahira et al., GCN23933). 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 1.35 s measured from T0+0.45 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+1.51 s, is 22 cnts/ms. 
The total counts from this burst is 23194 counts.

This light curve has not been corrected for the data loss, 
which was caused by the extreme brightness of this burst.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
