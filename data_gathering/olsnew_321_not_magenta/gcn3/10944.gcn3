Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge (NASA/MSFC) and Suzanne Foley (MPE) 
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 00:46:38.99 UT on 07 July 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100707 (trigger 300156400 / 100707.032).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger 
data, is RA = 351.07, DEC = -6.57 (J2000 degrees, 
equivalent to 23 h 24 m, -6 d 34 '), with an uncertainty 
of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.

The GBM light curve show a fast rise and exponential decay
with a duration (T90) of 82+/-1 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+83.009 s is 
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.91 +/- 0.02 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 283 +/- 7 keV

(C-Statistic 529.4 for 358 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(8.77 +/- 0.02)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+1.152 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 48.3 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
