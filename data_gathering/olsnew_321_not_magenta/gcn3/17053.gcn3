L. P. Xin,   X. F. Wang,  J. Y. Wei,  Y. L. Qiu, J. S. Deng,  
J. Wang,  X. H. Han and C. Wu on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB 141109A (D'Avanzo et al., GCNC 17037)  
with Xinglong  0.8-m TNT telescope at 2014-11-09, 19:45:06(UT),
about 13.95 hour after the burst.

The optical counterpart reported by ( Covino GCN 17039;  Xu et al., 17040)
 was  detected in 24*300 sec R-band coadded image. 
The brightness of the  optical emission is estimated to be 
about R=21.84 mag at the mid-time of 15.07 hours after the burst.

Combined with the reports ( Covino GCN 17039 and  Xu et al., 17040 ), 
the decay slope of this OT is roughtly about \alpha~1.12, 
if we fit the data with a single power law.

The message may be cited.
