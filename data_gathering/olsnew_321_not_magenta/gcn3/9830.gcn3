There are 6 MASTER Very Wide Field cameras located at Kislovodsk and Irkutsk 
with common FOW = 2000 + 1680 square degrees (http://observ.pereplet.ru/).

Four   MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Kislovodsk
(4 Carl Zeiss Planar T* 85/1.4 ZF, 4x420 square degrees, 11 Mpx, 22" per 
pix  with 4 polarizers) responded to 
the bright  GRB 090820 (Fermi TRIGGER_NUM:272421498, V. Connaughton, GCN 
9829), producing images beginning 9 s after the GRB Time (first alert notice).

We took 1300 images with 5 sec exposition in different polarizations.
Individual images have limiting magnitudes~11.

Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V) and very close 
to V band.
Other observations are required for independ error box elaboration.

The reduction is continued.
