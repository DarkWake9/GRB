"At 07:24:57.34 UT on 19 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GGRB 190519A (trigger 579943502 / 190519309), which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Ukwatta et al. 2019, GCN 24595). The 
GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 86.4 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-peaked structure with a duration (T90) 
of about 46 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.072 s to T0+50.177 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.  
The power law index is -1.06 +/- 0.02 and the cutoff energy, 
parameterized as Epeak, is 112 +/- 3 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.16 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024 sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+41.9847 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 35.8 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak= 108 +/- 3 keV, 
alpha = -1.04 +/- 0.03 and beta = -3.1 +/- 0.3.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
