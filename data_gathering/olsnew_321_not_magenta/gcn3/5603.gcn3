FROM:    Antonino Cucchiara at PSU  <cucchiara@astro.psu.edu>

S. Holland and A. Cucchiara report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began observing GRB 060923B (trigger #230702),
M. Stamatikos et al., GCN Circ. 5590) 122 seconds after the
BAT trigger. No optical afterglow is detected in the XRT
refined error circle (M. Capalbi et al., GCN Circ.5602).

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for the finding chart and the
coadded images for the UVOT filters are listed below:

W2            5368-5565       197             19.92

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. No correction has
been made for the Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.15 mag
(Schlegel et al. 1998) along the line of sight to the burst.
