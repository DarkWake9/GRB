The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:37:51 UT on 25 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191225B (trigger 598988276.867438 / 191225735).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 145.8, Dec = -7.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 43m, -7d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 61.0 degrees.
