Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100212A (trigger #412081)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 10401).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 356.445, 49.492 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 45m 46.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +49d 29' 30.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks.  The main peak starts
with weak emission at ~T-45 sec with the peak at ~T+0.2 sec and ends 
at ~T+30 sec.  A second peak starts at ~T+75 and ends at ~T+135 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 136 +- 14 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.8 to T+134.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.20 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.1 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.34 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
