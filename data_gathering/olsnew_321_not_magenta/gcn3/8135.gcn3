Christina C. Thoene (DARK/NBI), Antonio de Ugarte Postigo (ESO) and Davide
Ricci (Univ. of Liege) report:

We observed the complete 3' error box of the SuperAGILE GRB 080825B
(Evangelista et al., GCN 8133) using the Danish 1.54m + DFOSC at La
Silla (Chile) starting Aug. 25 at 23:18:31 UT (5.53 hours after the
burst). In the first I-band frame we detect a new source not present
in the DSS-2 catalogue at the following coordinates (J2000.0 +/-
0.7"):

RA: 13:56:48.22
DEC: -68:57:18.5

for which we measure an I-band magnitude of 17.4 +/- 0.2 as compared
to several USNO-B1 stars.

Further observations and analysis are ongoing to establish the connection
to the GRB and the fading of the object.
