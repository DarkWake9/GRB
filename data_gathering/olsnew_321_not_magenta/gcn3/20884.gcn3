report on behalf of the Swift team:

As discussed in LVC Circular 20841, Swift is conducting further
observations of the 'rank 3' X-ray sources detected in our initial search
of the LIGO/VIRGO error region. These are uncatalogued X-ray sources which
are below existing catalogue limits and therefore cannot be distinguished
as new or pre-existing sources.

Previously, Source 23 (Evans et al, LVC Circ. 20812, 20841) appeared to be
fading with a significance of 3.5 sigma. Swift subsequently performed a
series of daily observations, between 2017-03-13 and 2017-03-16, which
have shown that the source flux is remaining approximately constant, so is
unlikely to be related to the GW event and is therefore no longer
considered a source of interest.

In addition, sources 30, 88, 100 and 108 also show no signs of
variability. Source 89 matches a catalogued object which appears to be a
flare star, so the X-ray detection was most likely simply a stellar flare.
Observations of the other 'rank 3' sources are ongoing.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
