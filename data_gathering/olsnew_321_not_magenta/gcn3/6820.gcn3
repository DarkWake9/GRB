J. L. Racusin (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.7 ks of Swift XRT data for GRB 070920B (Racusin et al.,
GCN 6808) beginning 64 ks after the BAT trigger. The data are entirely in
Photon Counting mode, and reveal a faint uncatalogued X-ray source at RA,
Dec= 0.13029, -34.85284 degrees, which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000) =  00h 00m 31.27s
Dec(J2000) = -34d 51' 10.2"

with an estimated uncertainty of 8.0 arcsec (radius, 90% containment
including boresight uncertainty). This is 33 arcsec from the refined BAT
position (Barthelmy et al. GCN 6811). The source has a count rate of
2.1e-3 +/- 0.6e-3 counts s-1. At present we are unable to determine
whether the source is fading, however observations are ongoing.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
