J.French (UCD), P.Kubanek (U. Valencia) and M.Jelinek (IAA), report on
behalf of the Watcher collaboration:

The Watcher 40cm automated telescope at the Boyden Observatory, South
Africa, began imaging the field of GRB 070330 (Grupe et al, GCN 6232) at
22:57:40 UTC, 6.15min after the BAT trigger. An initial series of 10s
unfiltered exposures shows no new source down to a limiting magnitude of
approx. 16 mag. Stacking multiple frames to create a combined 848s
exposure with a mean time of 23:06:40 UTC (15.15min post-trigger) fails
to reveal any new source down a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of 18.2 mag.
Further observations are continuing.
