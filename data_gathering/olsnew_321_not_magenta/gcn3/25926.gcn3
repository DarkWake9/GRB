D. Svinkin, S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, D. Frederiks, A. Kozlova,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN, and

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

The long duration GRB 191001A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 25893;
BALROG localization: Burgess et al., GCN Circ. 25894)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 591604915), Konus-Wind,
and Swift (BAT) at about 24110 s UT (06:41:50).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=346.113 deg (23h 04m 27s) Dec(2000)=-7.939 deg (-7d 56' 21"),
whose radius is 46.475 +/- 2.251 deg (3 sigma).

The distance between the optical transient ATLAS19wxr
(Smartt, et al., GCN Circ. 25922; Pereyra et al., GCN Circ. 25911)
and the annulus center line is 9.3 arcmin,
supporting the association of the transient and the GRB.

This annulus may be improved.
