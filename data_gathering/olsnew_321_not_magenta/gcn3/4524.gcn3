report:

" We observed the error region of GRB 060116 (Campana et al., GCN
4519) using 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. After the
twliglights, the I and R band observations were started at 11.16 UT(
about 2.9 hours after burst). No variable source was detected in the
BAT and XRT error region(Campana et al. GCN 4522) at our co-add I and
R images.  The limiting magnitude of I and R band were calibrated
against USNO-B1.0 catalog (I and R, respectively).
