TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2113
SUBJECT: GRB030329: Optical observcations
DATE:    03/04/07 15:25:45 GMT

V.Lyuty and V.Metlov (Crimean Laboratory of the Sternberg Astronomical
Institute, Moscow State University) report:

We have observed the GRB030329 OT found by B.A.Peterson and P.A.Price
(GCN 1985) with 60-cm telescope at Crimean laboratory of the Sternberg 
Astronomical Institute. Our observations started at
Mar 31, 18:00 UT. A set of 120 sec. exposures in R (Johnson) filter was
obtained under poor weather conditions.
We have estimated the R magnitudes of the OT using USNO U1050_06350247
star (R=16.06). The results are shown in the table below.

        Average:        16.98+/-0.03

It is possible that the beginning of the next phase of decrease of OT
brightness took place.
