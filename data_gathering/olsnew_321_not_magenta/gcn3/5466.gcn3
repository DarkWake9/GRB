of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a region centered on the Swift burst GRB 060719 (GCN 5339)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array starting at UT 16:22 July
30 and ending at 00:51 July 31. No emission was seen at a frequency of
8.7 GHz within the XRT error circle. The 3-sigma detection limits are
0.18 mJy and the beam size was 1.9"x0.5"."

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia
Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
