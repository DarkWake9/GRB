"We obtained V band images of the GRB 990907 field (GCN #405 and 
GCN #409) at the Anglo Australian Telescope with Taurus + MITLL2, 
at the ESO 1.54m Danish telescope with DFOSC, and at the ESO VLT telescope
with FORS1, beginning 24.9 hrs after the GRB event. Images in other bands 
(R and I) were also acquired as detailed in the following table:

Photometric calibration was done using standard stars in the Landolt
field PG0231+051. Comparisons were made among the V, R, and I band
images with the Digital Sky Survey, between the two R and among the 
five V frames taken at different epochs.
The comparison does not show any object with significant brightness
variations larger than 0.3 mag.
