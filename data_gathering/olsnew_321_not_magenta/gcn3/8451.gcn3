P. Chandra (RMC), S. B. Cenko (Berkeley), D. A. Frail (NRAO) and
F. Harrison (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the Fermi-LAT detected
short hard burst GRB 081024B (GCN 8407) at a frequency of 8.46
GHz on 2008 Oct. 28.99 UT. The VLA field of view was centered at
RA: 21:31:37.63   Dec: +21:16:33.0 (J2000.0) for the observation.
We don't see any radio source in the VLA field of view. The map
rms is 38 uJy.
