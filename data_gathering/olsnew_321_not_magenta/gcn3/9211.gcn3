A. Henden (AAVSO), J. Gross (SRO), B. Denny (DC-3),
D. Terrell (SwRI), and W. Cooney (SRO) report:

We obtained photometry of the GRB090418A afterglow
reported by Chornock et al. (GCN 9148) using the Sonoita
Research Observatory (SRO) 35cm telescope in southern
Arizona, utilizing an automatic VOevent trigger.  The
Rc-band exposures began about 2 minutes after the burst
and continued until twilight.  Ten 60-second and five
180-second exposures were acquired.

Astrometry of the afterglow from several images and
using UCAC as the reference catalog yields coordinates:
17:57:15.151 +33:24:20.93 J2000 (+/- 50mas)

Photometry, assuming that the star at
17:57:42.53 +33:25:47.2
has an R magnitude of 13.12

Where delT is the time in seconds from the burst (Mangano et al.,
GCN 9149), and the exposure is in seconds. The optical afterglow
candidate is in the filter reflection halo from HD163948,
a 6.9mag star about 2arcmin distant, so the last
few magnitudes may have a systematic bias.

We note that this field was not calibrated by SDSS through DR6.
We will perform a BVRI calibration over the next few nights.
