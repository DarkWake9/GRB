report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team

We have analysed the Swift-XRT follow-up observation of the source
(trigger #333320; Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 8457)
started on 2008-11-01 14:49:13 UT (about 11 ks after the trigger).
In the first 3.4 ks of data no source is detected within the
BAT refined error circle (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 8458)
down to a limiting flux of 1.4e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
