(UMD) report:

We observed the field of GRB 170205A (Troja, et al., GCN 20603) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/02 5.53 to 2017/02 5.58 UTC (2.3 minutes
to 1.25 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.61 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.29 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections for the optical afterglow (see, also, Guidorzi, et al., GCN
20605):

r = 18.31 +/- 0.01
i = 17.90 +/- 0.01
Z = 18.06 +/- 0.01
Y = 19.26 +/- 0.07

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source fades (from i~16 mag)
as t^(-1.6) until ~15 minutes after the GRB, after which the fade flattens
to t^(-1.1).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
