on behalf of a larger collaboration

We observed GRB 130511A (Krimm et al., GCN 14620) 
in BVRI filters using a 0.6m telescope at the Sobaeksan
Optical Astronomy Observatory (SOAO), starting at 76min 
after the BAT alert.

In stacked images of 6 x 300sec exposures, we identify
the optical afterglow with the following magnitude
(Cucchiara et al. GCN 14621; Takaki et al. GCN 14626),
calibrated against a USNO-B1 star in the vicinity.

   T(mid, UT)         Mag
05-11 13:50:12     R=20.78 +- 0.13

The afterglow is detected in the other bands, but at
a lower S/N.

We thank the staffs at SOAO for performing the observation.
