J. Haislip, A. LaCluyze, D. Reichart, S. Heathcote, P. Ugarte, A. Alvares, 
R. Baptista, & M. Nysewander report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN 
GRB Collaboration:

We observed the localization of the short/hard GRB 061201 (Marshal et al., 
GCN 5881) with SOAR/OSIRIS in JKs beginning 10.2 hours after the burst.

We detect the source identified by Holland et al. (GCN 5883) and D'Avanzo 
et al. (GCN 5884).

We reobserved the field in J beginning 33.6 hours after the burst.  The 
source appears to have faded by at least 1.3 mag (3 sigma) and is no longer 
detected.

Consequently, this source appears to be the afterglow.
