Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161214B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 726885) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 32.4s after the GRB trigger
(17.7s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
51 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good with the moon.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+32.4s to t0+92.4s : Rlim = 17.3

Later images show the star at the following magnitudes:
t0+ 1046 sec to t0+ 1496 sec : 17.6 +/- 0.5
t0+ 1561 sec to t0+ 2371 sec : 17.8 +/- 0.5
t0+ 3681 sec to t0+ 4581 sec : 18.2 +/- 0.7

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
