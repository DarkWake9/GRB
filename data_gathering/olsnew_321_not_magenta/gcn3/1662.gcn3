report:

This burst (GCN 1658, 1660) was also observed by Mars Odyssey - HEND.  We
have triangulated it to a  preliminary, 3 sigma error boxes whose area
is ~1200  square arcminutes and whose coordinates are:


 ERROR BOX CENTER:  14 h 26 m 18.78 s    -22 o 42 '  26.04 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 14 h 31 m 10.21 s    -22 o  8 '  58.20 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 14 h 26 m 54.32 s    -22 o 47 '   8.38 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 14 h 25 m 43.21 s    -22 o 37 '  43.62 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 14 h 21 m  8.02 s    -23 o 16 '  57.75 " 

Only small improvements to this error box are expected.
