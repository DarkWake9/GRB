The XRT started observing the field of the BAT  trigger 325707 
(Immler et al.,  GCN Circ. 8285) on 2008-09-23, at 21:50:46UT, 
80.1s after the BAT trigger. 

   No X-ray source was found in or near the BAT error circle in a 3.3 ks
exposure (17 ksec elapsed time) Swift/XRT Photon Counting mode image 
down to a 3 sigma limiting 0.3-10keV count
rate of 3.67e-3 count/s. Assuming a power-law spectrum of photon index 2
absorbed by the Galactic column density of 2.16e21 cm-2 at the position 
of the BAT trigger, this corresponds to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux limit of
1.50e-13 erg cm-2 s-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
