J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:31:12.89 UT on 17 June 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220617A (trigger 677183477 / 220617772).
which was also detected by the Fermi-LAT (N. Di Lalla et al. 2022, GCN 32212).

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 32209) is consistent with the LAT position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.1 s to T0+0.5 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.7 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 2.3 +/- 0.3 MeV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.3 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 10 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
