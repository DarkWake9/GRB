Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 101117B (trigger #438675)
(Wolf, et al., GCN Circ. 11411).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 172.991, -72.651 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 31m 57.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -72d 39' 04.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-0.2 sec, peaking at ~T+1.0 sec, and roughly exponentially decaying
out to ~T+40 sec.  There is possible emission (at the 2-sigma c.l.)
from around T+150 to T+220 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.2 +- 1.8 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+8.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.50 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.74 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 
 
The results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at

This burst was called the "B" burst to avoid possible confusion with the
earlier published XRF 101117A event by the MAXI team (GCN Circ 11410).
