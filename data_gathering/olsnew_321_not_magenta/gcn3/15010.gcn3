We report the spectral lag analysis for GRB 130716A (GCN Circ. 15506) based on 
the BAT data.  Using 16-ms binned light curve, the spectral lag for the 25-50 keV 
to 100-350 keV bands is -2 (+50/-40) ms, and +11 (+25/-14) ms for the 15-25 keV to 
50-100 keV bands.  Although the lag value is not well constrained (relatively large 
errors), we believe this burst is more consistent with short burst category.  There is 
no evidence for extended emission.
