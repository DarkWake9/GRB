Trieste, and INFN Trieste), report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S191110af at T0 = 2019-11-10 
23:06:44 (UT), analysis of AGILE data shows that the satellite at T0 was 
in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). Scientific telemetry was inhibited 
during the time interval (T0 -700 s; T0 + 200 s).

At T0+200s we obtained a MCAL preliminary 3-sigma fluence upper limits 
(UL) for a 1 s integration time t different celestial positions within 
the accessible S191110af localization region, from a minimum of 1.46E-06 
erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 6.76E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model 
a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in 
the energy range 0.4 - 100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in 
progress.
