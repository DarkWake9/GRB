Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120803A (trigger #529582)
(Racusin, et al., GCN Circ. 13565).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 269.531, -6.733 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 58m 07.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -06d 43' 58.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 54%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T+0,
peaking ~T+3 sec, and returning to baseline at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.0 +- 3.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.40 to T+11.40 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.86 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.40 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.

We note that in our original circular (13565) that this event was labeled
as a "possible" GRB.  Given that the BAT detection significance
in ground proccessing has risen to 8.0 sigma, that the lightcurve shape
is consistant with a GRB, and that it is off the Galactic Plane,
we are confident that this trigger is due to a real GRB.
