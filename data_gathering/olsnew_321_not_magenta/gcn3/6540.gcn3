P.Schady (MSSL-UCL) and N. Lyons (Leicster) report on behalf of the 
UVOT team

Swift/UVOT began observing the field of the INTEGRAL burst GRB070615 
10.7hrs after the IBAS trigger in the V and white filters. No afterglow 
is detected in any of the individual or co-added observations down to 
the following 5-sigma upper limits:

Filter           T_mid (s) Exp (s)   UL Mag (5sig)
====================================
V		46354	2887	19.59
White	51435	36		18.07
====================================

where T_mid corresponds to weighted mid time of the observation. The 
values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.12 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
