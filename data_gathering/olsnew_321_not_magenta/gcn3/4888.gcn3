MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to 
GRB060319.0 (GRB_TIME is 2006-03-19 00:55:42.92) by all cameras.

The first unfiltred image was at 2006-03-19 00:58:24.96 UT, 80 s after 
notice time and 162  after the GRB time
The first spectral image was at 2006-03-19 00:58:33 UT, 88 s after
notice time and 170  after the GRB time

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
The robot not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  17.7 (s/n=3).

The reduction is continuing.
