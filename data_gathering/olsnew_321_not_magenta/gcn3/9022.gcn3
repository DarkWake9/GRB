V.Chaplin (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:05:10.53 UT on 20 March 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090320C (trigger 259203912 / 090320045).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 108.2, DEC = -43.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 7h 13m, -43d 18'), with an uncertainty
of 15.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 40 degrees.

The GBM light curve has a duration (T90) of about 4 s (8-1000 keV),
with a peak at about T0-2 seconds.

Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly  
constrained."
