G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:25:28 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080623 (trigger=315080).  Swift did not immediately slew
because of an Earth observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 237.660, -62.038, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 50m 38s
   Dec(J2000) = -62d 02' 16"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showes several overlapping peaks
with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~7 sec after the trigger. 

XRT and UVOT observations will begin when the source comes out of 
Earth constraint near T+21 minutes. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
