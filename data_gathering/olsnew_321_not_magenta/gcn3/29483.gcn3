Using the data set from T-240 to T+600 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210211A (trigger #1032024)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 29472).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 269.408, -46.270 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  17h 57m 38.0s 
  Dec(J2000) = -46d 16' 11.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single broad peak starting at T-1 sec,
and decaying to background by T+8 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.1 +- 0.6 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.70 to T+5.90 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.09 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.2 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
