This is a time-dominant survey follow-up report of Liu et al. (GCN19208). Each FOV of NOWT was monitored 3 days using standard BVR bands, and it was marked as EWE001, EWE002, EWE003 and EWE004. Note that the calibrated magnitude value of 15 is an assumption as a up-limited magnitude in our caculation. This would imply that EM-trigger of GW sources could not correspond with the brightness targets. Meanwhile all the targets had the value of SNR>10. We reported the photometric variable information during the time-dominant survey as below.

1)Detailed information about the observation of EWE001 (time range: 2016:03:06:13:14:05 to 2016:03:06:23:37:35, 2016:03:08:13:42:24 to 2016:03:08:23:42:55, 2016:03:09:13:15:58 to 2016:03:09:23:27:43)

Note: 21 targets can be found as the photometric variability, and the follow-up of spectrograph observation should be important next. Analysis is ongoing.
