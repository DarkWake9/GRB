The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:31:34 UT on 12 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210912B (trigger 653142699.29167 / 210912522).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.9, Dec = 24.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 59m, 24d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 103.0 degrees.
