"We observed GRB 220521A (Dichiara et al., GCN 32076) with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 39 GHz beginning on 2022 May 24 14:44 UT.
We detect a radio counterpart at a position consistent with the X-ray
position (Evans et al., GCN 32077), optical position (Malesani et al., GCN
32078), and mm-band position (Laskar et al., GCN 32110) with a preliminary
flux density of ~ 0.2 mJy at a mid-time of 2.4 days after the burst.

We thank the CSIRO staff for approving and scheduling these observations.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope
National Facility which is funded by the Australian Government for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO. We acknowledge the
Gomeroi people as the traditional owners of the Observatory site."
