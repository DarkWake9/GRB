TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5034
SUBJECT: GRB 060428B: MDM Observations

FROM:    Jules Halpern at Columbia U.  <jules@astro.columbia.edu>

J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) and N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) report:

"We observed the optical afterglow (Price et al. GCN 5019; Li et al. GCN 5027)
of Swift GRB 060428B (Campana et al. GCN 5017) in the R band on the MDM 1.3m
telescope during the period April 29.15-29.49 UT, or 18.6-26.8 hours after
the burst. The fading noted by Abe et al. (GCN 5021) has continued.  We
estimate R~22.5 at 24 hours post-burst based on calibration with Landolt
standard stars.  We note that all of the objects within 25" of the transient
appear to be galaxies, including one having R=19.4 that is only 3" to the
east.

A combined image of 1 hour total exposure at 24 hours post-burst is available
