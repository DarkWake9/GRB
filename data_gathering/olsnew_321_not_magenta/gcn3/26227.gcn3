Evryscope-South, located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, (Ratzloff et al. 2019, Law et al. 2015)
began observing the error region of LIGO/Virgo S191110af at 2019-11-11 01:00:05 UT during regular
science operations.  Evryscope-South has an instantaneous field of view of 8520 sq. degrees and observes
at a continuous 2-minute cadence in Sloan g'.

Evryscope-North, located at Mount Laguna Observatory, California, began observing the error region
of LIGO/Virgo S191110af at 2019-11-11 01:35:30 UT during regular science operations. Evryscope-North
has an instantaneous field of view of 7409 sq. degrees and observes at a continuous 2-minute cadence in Sloan g'.

Under current full-moon conditions, single-exposure limiting magnitudes ranged from 12.5 to 14.5 as
a function of moon elongation and airmass, averaging 13.7, calibrated to the ATLAS All-Sky Stellar
Reference Catalog (Tonry 2018).

We performed an automated search for optical transients over all Evryscope-South images within
5 hours of the alert, selecting candidates that appeared in multiple frames and were not associated
with previously-detected variable sources. During this interval, Evryscope-South observed 93% of the
LIGO/Virgo skymap and Evryscope-North observed 2% of the skymap. We found no candidates
within the visible 90% probability containment region for S191110af. Evryscope-North data analysis is ongoing.
