SUBJECT: GRB 140719B: Swift detection of a burst
DATE:    14/07/19 21:03:42 GMT
FROM:    Rhaana Starling at U of Leicester  <rlcs1@star.le.ac.uk>

R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC),
S. B. Cenko (GSFC), L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU),
C. J. Mountford (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:49:35.68 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140719B (trigger=605700).  Due to a Moon constraint, Swift 
could not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 39.738d,  -2.378d which is 
  RA(J2000) = 02h 38m 57s
  Dec(J2000) = -02d 22' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 06:44 UT on 2014 July 21. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is R. L. C. Starling (rlcs1 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
