C. Pagani (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

Swift performed 4 tiled observations of the MAXI detected GRB 130407A (Fukushima et al., GCN 14359) to cover the MAXI error circle. The data are all in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No bright X-ray afterglow is detected in the XRT observations.

The 3sigma upper limit is 1.1 x 10^-2  cts/s. This corresponds to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.7 x 10^-13  erg/cm2/s, assuming a typical GRB spectrum with photon spectral index of 2. If we consider the Galactic absorption in this direction (4.9 x 10^20  cm^-2; Kalberla et al. 2005) this corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 4.3 x 10^-13  erg/cm2/s.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
