GRB 991216 Optical Observation

J. Zhu, on behalf of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory GRB team, report:

"A combined field of about 1.8 degrees in radius centered at the
BACODINE_FINAL_POSITION of GRB991216 (also given in GCN #463) was
observed with the BAO 60/90 cm Schmidt telescope starting from about
1 hour after the GRB event. For the observed 12 fields of each in 
f.o.v. of 58' X 58', 3 150-s exposures were taken in different epoch.
The limiting magnitude for combined images is expected to be fainter
than R=20, and will be checked when I arrive the observation site
this evening.

However, even for the quite large coverage, it's a pity that the later 
RXTE_PCA_POSITION of the GRB was out of the observed area.

We are planning to observe the RXTE_PCA_POSITION tonight with one 
58' X 58' fields in much longer exposure time from about Dec. 17.5 UT. 
Any comments and suggestions are welcomed to zj@bac.pku.edu.cn (with
a copy to zhu_jin@263.net for urgent message).

This report may be cited."
