SUBJECT: GRB 121102A : a long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), E.Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, 
R.Boissay (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 02:27:00 UT of November 2

The refined coordinates are

  RA  = 270.9034  deg 
BDEC = -16.9509  deg

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a burst peak flux of about 1 counts/cm2/s 
(20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range 
of about 1e-6 erg/cm2.
