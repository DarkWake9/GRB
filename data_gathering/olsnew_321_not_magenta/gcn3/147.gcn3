TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  147
SUBJECT: GRB980703, Host galaxy multicolor photometry
DATE:    98/07/28 12:43:21 GMT
FROM:    Vladimir Sokolov at SAO RAS  <sokolov@sao.ru>

On 1998 July 25.01 UT we obtained B (480 sec), V (420 sec), Rc (300 sec)
and Ic (360 sec) band images of the proposed host galaxy of GRB980703
(GCN #137, 139) with the 6-m BTA telescope of SAO-RAS.
We reliably detected an extended object - the GRB host galaxy - in all
4 bands.
Conditions were photometric with seeing of 1.15 arcsec.
Photometric calibration were performed using Landolt's star PG2336+004
and PG2331+055.

Photometry of the GRB980703 host galaxy on 4 arcsec diameter aperture gave:

    B = 23.04+/-0.09
    V = 23.02+/-0.10
    Rc= 22.43+/-0.08
    Ic= 22.10+/-0.18

As already reported (GCN #137), the host galaxy is blue.

Images and broadband spectrum of will be posted at
