E. Bissaldi (Politecnico & INFN Bari)
reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 502258294/161201175
at 04:11:30.57 UT on 01 December 2016, tentatively classified as a GRB,
is in fact not due to a GRB.
This trigger is due to local particles.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
by the GBM Flight Software owing to the high fluence
of the particle event. This ARR was accepted and the spacecraft
slewed to the GBM in-flight location."
