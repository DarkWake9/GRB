Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130610A (trigger #557845)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 14842).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 224.414, 28.187 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  14h 57m 39.3s
    Dec(J2000) = +28d 11' 13.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
46.4 +- 11.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.04 to T+61.02 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.27 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.53 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
