We report the photometric measurements of two promising candidates
ZTF19aarykkb and ZTF19aarzaod (GCN 24191) associated with the gravitational
wave trigger S190425z (GCN 24168) using Lulin One-meter Telescope(LOT) in
Taiwan. The observations were conducted using g, r, i filters at 2019-04-25
15:57:19 UT, ~7.65 hours after the trigger, and 2019-04-25 17:25:43, ~9.12
hours after the trigger, respectively. Preliminary photometry were obtained
by calibrating with Pan-STARRS catalog.

We would like to thank the staff in Lulin Observatory for helping the
observations.

Also, we searched for optical counterpart in 90% localization area of
LIGO/Virgo S190425z (GCN 24168). The observation started at 2019-04-25
12:27:23 UT, 249 minutes after the trigger, and 27 galaxies were observed
in R-band with 180 second exposure time. No obvious transient can be
identified brighter than R~20 mag (AB). The galaxy coordinates are listed
below.
