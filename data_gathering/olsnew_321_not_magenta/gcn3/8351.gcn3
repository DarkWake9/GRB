Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 081008 (trigger
#331093) (Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 8344).  The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA, Dec = 279.968, -57.433 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  18h 39m 52.4s
    Dec(J2000) = -57d 25' 58.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90%
containment).  The partial coding was 81%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows two strong peaks at T+0 and T+110s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 185.5 +- 40.3 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-65 to T+201 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  A cutoff-power law model is also an
acceptable fit with an E_peak of 88 keV.  The power law index of the
time-averaged spectrum is 1.69 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV
band is 4.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T+7.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1
ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
