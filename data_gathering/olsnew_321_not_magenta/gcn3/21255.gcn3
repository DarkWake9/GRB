The long-duration GRB 170614A (Fermi-GBM trigger #519133191;
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7869; Konus-Wind trigger time on
11:39:55.892) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 11:39:43.86 on 14 June 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all
CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows multiple peaks.  The entire
burst episode starts at T+~2 sec, peaks at T+~20 sec and ends
at T+~40 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
22 +- 1 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
