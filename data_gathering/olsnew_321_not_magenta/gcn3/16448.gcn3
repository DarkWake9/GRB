We observed the field of GRB 140622A detected by Swift (trigger #602278; 
D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 16433) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T11 (0.51 m Planewave) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory 
(NM, USA).  

60 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from June 22 09:50:33 (UT) 
about 14.5 minutes after the trigger and stopped on June 22 11:01:25 (UT).  We do not detect 
the optical afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked image at the enhanced X-ray 
afterglow position (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 16434).  The estimated five sigma upper limit of 
the combined image (total exposure of 3600 sec) is ~18.5 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
