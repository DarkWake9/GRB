The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:15:38 UT on 24 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200824A (trigger 619971343.818026 / 200824594).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 117.7, Dec = 10.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 50m, 10d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 58.0 degrees.
