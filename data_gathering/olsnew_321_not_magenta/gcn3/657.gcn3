K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB Team, S. Barthelmy and
R. M. Kippen on behalf of the BATSE GRB Team, T. Cline and E.
Mazets, on behalf of the NEAR and KONUS-WIND GRB Teams, and
F. Frontera, C. Guidorzi and E. Montanari, on behalf of the
BeppoSAX GRBM Team, report:

Ulysses, BATSE, Konus, NEAR, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed
GRB000429 (BATSE 8087) at 36430 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses,
this burst had a duration of ~50 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of
~4 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a 0.25 s peak flux of ~6 x 10^-7 erg/
cm^2 s.  We have localized this burst to a preliminary 3 sigma
error box with an area of ~90 sq. arcmin with the following
coordinates:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  6 h 33 m 20.80 s     -4 o 24 '  49.24 "  (CENTER)
  6 h 32 m 49.24 s     -4 o 27 '   6.45 "  (CORNER)
  6 h 33 m 32.66 s     -4 o 18 '  40.36 "  (CORNER)
  6 h 33 m  8.98 s     -4 o 30 '  58.52 "  (CORNER)
  6 h 33 m 52.44 s     -4 o 22 '  32.36 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined considerably.
