report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-05-30T10:19:08.90 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190530A (trigger ID: HEB190530429) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (GCN #24676), Fermi/LAT 
(GCN #24679), and AGILE/MCAL(GCN #24678). 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple
pulses with a duration (T90) of 20.31 s measured from T0+2.11 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+10.52 s, is 18182 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 214189 counts. 
Some part of the Insight-HXMT/HE light curve suffers data saturation 
due to the extreme brightness of this burst.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
