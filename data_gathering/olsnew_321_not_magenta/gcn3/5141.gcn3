Using the data set from T-239 to T+360 sec from recent telemetry
downlinks, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060515
(trigger #210084)  (Cummings, et al., GCN 5132).  The BAT ground-
calculated position is
(RA,Dec) = 127.295, 73.562 deg {8h 29m 10.7s, 73d 33' 43.2"} (J2000)
+- 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  This position
is 0.7 arcmin from the onboard-calculated position and 0.3 arcmin
from the XRT refined position (Page et al. GCN 5139).  The partial 
coding was 38%.
 
The light curve shows a single weak, long FRED peak.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 52 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics). There is no
indication of emission in the BAT energy band after T+70.  As noted
earlier, Swift did not slew to the burst because of an Earth limb
constraint.  At T+140 sec, Swift executed a preplanned slew away from 
the burst, which was then in the extreme partially coded field of view,
so constraints on emission are poor.  After T+360, Swift entered the 
SAA and we have no further information on any possible extended 
emission.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.2 to T+57.5 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power-law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.15 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+5.58 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All
the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
