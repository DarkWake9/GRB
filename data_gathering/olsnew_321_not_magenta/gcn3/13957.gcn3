behalf 
of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

Swift GRB 121108A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 13952) was observed with the 1.3m
Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope at Nainital. Three images in R_c pass-band
(300s each) were obtained starting at 2012-11-08 19:56:19 (UT).

In the co-added R_c frame (300s x 3), we did not detect any optical source
within the XRT error-box down to a limiting magnitude of ~21 mag.
