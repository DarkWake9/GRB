We performed both NIR and optical observations of the field of GRB 
040827 (Mereghetti et al., GCNs 2670, 2672) with the ESO-VLT. NIR 
observations were performed on Aug 27.96 and 28.96 (11 and 35 hrs after 
the GRB respectively).

We confirm the variability of source XMM2 (Gladders & Berger, GCN 2681; 
Kaplan & Berger, GCN 2683; Tanvir et al., GCN 2684), which fades by 0.7 
+- 0.2 mag in the K filter. During both observations the seeing was 
similar (0.9" and 1.0"), therefore even if the source is extended (thus 
making photometry more tricky) this variability is a real effect. JHK 
colors of the object (on Aug 27) are consistent with a power law 
spectral shape, with a spectral index beta ~ 1.4. Note however that a 
significant contribution from the host may be present in our measurements.

Given the variability of XMM2 and its spatial coincidence with the X-ray 
source detected by XMM (Rodriguez-Pascual & Juarez, GCN 2678; see also 
http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb040827/index.shtml 
for a refined position), we also conclude that XMM2 is likely the 
afterglow of GRB 040827 (Kaplan & Berger, GCN 2683; Tanvir et al., GCN 
2684).

I-band observations were performed on Aug 28.99 and Aug 30.01. No 
significant variation is seen between the two epochs (at the ~0.2 mag 
level). The source has I ~ 22.6 in both nights. This suggests that the 
emission is dominated by the host galaxy at these epochs, therefore 
implying a very weak afterglow. Otherwise, the decay may have 
experienced a plateaux phase.

A spectrum taken with the VLT on Aug 30.00) shows a weak featureless 
continuum in the range 4600-8600 A. The lack of detection of any 
emission lines does not allow us to determine a redshift, but it can put 
some constraints on it. For example, the non-detection of [O III] 5006 A 
(usually prominent in GRB host galaxies spectra) would imply z > 0.7. 
The absence of Ly alpha emission also limits z < 2.7.

We acknowledge the big effort of the ESO observing staff at Paranal, in 
particular Chris Lidman, Elena Mason, Claudio Melo, Nancy Ageorges, 
Stephane Brillant and Andres Pino.
