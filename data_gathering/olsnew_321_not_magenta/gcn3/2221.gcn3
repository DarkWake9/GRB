K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 21024
seconds.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 9 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.5E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area
is approximately 275 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  5 h 26 m 24.19 s      7 o  8 '  47.66 "  (CENTER)
  5 h 29 m 29.24 s      6 o  5 '   7.72 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 29 m 32.20 s      6 o  7 '   4.37 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 23 m 14.12 s      8 o 11 '  55.65 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 23 m 16.87 s      8 o 13 '  58.39 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved, but it is not known at this point
whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus whether a
significantly smaller error box can be derived for it.
