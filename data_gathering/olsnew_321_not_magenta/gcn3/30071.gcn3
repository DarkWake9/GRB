The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:59:59 UT on 24 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210524A (trigger 643525204.091768 / 210524208).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 337.3, Dec = -47.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 29m, -47d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
