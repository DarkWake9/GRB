SUBJECT: GRB 080319B: Optical observation (Brno, CZ)

We observed GRB 080319B using 40cm Newtonian telescope, SBIG ST-7XMEi
CCD camera and R-band Kron-Cousins filter. We found afterglow to be
R=20.0+-0.3 mag at 2008.03.20 0.125 UT. Given time is mid-exposure
(total exposure: 6.7h). Weather conditions were poor because of clouds
and Moon. We used 13 nearby USNO-B1.0 stars to get R magnitude. An
aperture photometry package Munipack
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998stel.conf...30H) was used for data
reduction.
