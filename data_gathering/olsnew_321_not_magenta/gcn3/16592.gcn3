H.-F. Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:25:55.42 UT on 14 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140714A (trigger 427011958 / 140714268).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is 
RA = 221.0, Dec = 40.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 14h 44m, 40d 18'), 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is 
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The initial angle from the Fermi LAT boresight, using the GBM
on-ground calculated location, is 68 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main emission episodes,
with a duration (T90) of about 132 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+100.353 s to T0+129.026 s is
well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 81.9 +/- 2.3 keV,
alpha = -0.84 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.8 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.57 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+113.794 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 15.6 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
