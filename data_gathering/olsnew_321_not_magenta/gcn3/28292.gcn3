The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:09:42 UT on 26 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200826B (trigger 620172587.721156 / 200826923).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 151.3, Dec = 51.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 05m, 51d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 96.0 degrees.
