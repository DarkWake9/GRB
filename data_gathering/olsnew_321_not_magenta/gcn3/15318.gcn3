P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team,

There was a mistake in the "Swift-XRT refined analysis" circular (GCN 
Circ. 15311) in which it was erroneously stated that the light curve was 
consistent with a constant source. In fact, the light curve is decaying 
as a power-law with an index of 1.01 (+/- 0.07). We apologise for any 
confusion caused. As ever, the full light curve and related GRB products 
are online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00573190

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
