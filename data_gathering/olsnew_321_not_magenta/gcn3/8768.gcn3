V. Mangano (INAF-IASF PA), S. Bathelemy (GSFC), P. A. Curran

report on behalf the Swift team:

Based on its bright multiwavelength emission and good sun angle,
the Swift team declares GRB 090102 to be a burst of interest
to be followed by Swift to late time.  We encourage ground
based follow-ups and cooperation of the scientific community in
revising Swift observation plans according to results.  Please post
your results / plans or send us informal information.
