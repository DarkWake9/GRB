INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS) and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst
at 00243 seconds.  As observed by INTEGRAL, it had a duration of
approximately 0.5 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus
centered at RA, Decl (2000)=341.562, -13.235 degrees, whose radius is
81.798 +/- 0.093 degrees (3 sigma).  We note that this annulus includes
the position of SGR0525-66, although the probability that this could
occur by chance is not negligible.  As this burst was not observed by
Ulysses, a small error box cannot be obtained for it, but if it was
observed by other near-Earth spacecraft, it may be possible to obtain
an error box for it.  The non-detection by Ulysses implies that this
event had a hard spectrum.
