Using the data set from T-142 s to T+641 s (when the burst was in the BAT FOV)
from the recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181125A
(trigger #873433) (Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 23448).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 268.391, -2.634 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  17h 53m 33.8s
  Dec(J2000) = -02d 38' 01.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 69%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+11 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.5 +- 5.0 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.18 to T+11.24 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.31.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.3 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
