K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses and RHESSI also observed this burst (GCN 1786).  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 5 seconds, a 25-100 keV
fluence of approximately  5.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  6.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000) = 2.023, -37.567 degrees, whose radius is 14.958 +/-  
0.144 degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved. but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
