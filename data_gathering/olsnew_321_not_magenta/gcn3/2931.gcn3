DETECTION OF POLARIZATION OF THE RADIO EMISSION FROM SGR 1806-20 

B. M. Gaensler (CfA), C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC, NSSTC), R. Wijers (University
of Amsterdam), M. Garrett (JIVE), M. Finger, P. Woods, S. Patel (USRA, NSSTC),
M. McLaughlin (Jodrell Bank) report on behalf of a larger team:

Further to the reports on the radio emission from SGR 1806-20 (Cameron &
Kulkarni, GCN 2928, and Gaensler et al, GCN 2929, Atel # 373) we detect linear
polarization from the source at 1.4, 4.9, 8.5 GHz at a level of at least 2.6,
0.9, 3.8%, respectively. We caution, however, that these are very preliminary
results and more detailed analysis is underway to account for the possibility
of polarization leakage from the total intensity signal.
