A. C. Updike and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University)
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 061222B 45 minutes after  Swift Trigger 252593
with the SARA 0.9m at Kitt Peak under good weather conditions.  We
obtained 20 180-second exposures in the R band.  We find no fading OT
candidate at the position noted by E. Berger (GCN 5956) in the stacked
images down to a limiting magnitude of R = 19.0 +/-  0.2 mag (based on
calibration to USNO A2.0).
