TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030710 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 83100 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 12 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  8.5E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 335.196, -28.033 degrees, whose radius is 49.511 +/-  0.035
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
