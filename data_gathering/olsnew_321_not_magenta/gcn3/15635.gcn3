Using the data set from T-240 to T+443 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 131229A (trigger #582374)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 15627).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 85.236, -4.401 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 40m 56.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -04d 24' 04.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows many overlapping peaks
starting at ~T-1 sec, peaking at ~T+14 sec, and ending at ~T+17 sec
with a long low-level tail exteding out to ~T+430 sec, at which point
the BAT data stops due to entering the SAA.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
13.86 +- 0.43 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.08 to T+27.04 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.02 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.6 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+13.55 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 10.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
