The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:04:04 UT on 12 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210312A (trigger 637214649.894644 / 210312169).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 68.2, Dec = -16.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 32m, -16d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 47.0 degrees.
