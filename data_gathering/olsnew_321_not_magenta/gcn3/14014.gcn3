"At 21:14:52.55 UT on 22 Nov 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located the intense GRB 121122A (trigger 375311695/121122885,
IPN detection and localization: Hurley et al., GCN 14001).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 159 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two overlapping peaks with FRED-like pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 8.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.0 s to T0+17.4 s is
well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 178 +/- 4 keV,
alpha = -0.68 +/- 0.06 , and beta = -3.1 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.46 +/- 0.07)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.7 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 56 +/- 3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
