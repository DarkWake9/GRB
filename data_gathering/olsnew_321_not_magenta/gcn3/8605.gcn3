B. Sbarufatti, V. La Parola, V. Mangano (INAF-IASF Pa) report on  
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift began observing the field of the Swift BAT Slew Survey (BATSS)  
GRB 081203B (Copete et al., GCN Circ. 8600, 8602) 16.7 ks after the  
trigger. Using 1419 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data we detect a  
single uncatalogued source inside the BAT error circle. Using the XRT  
data and 2 UVOT images, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray  
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field  
sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec =
228.7993, 44.4284 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  15 15 11.83
Dec (J2000): +44 25 42.3

with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The  
source lies 27 arcsec from the BAT centroid and has a count rate of  
~5.5e-1 counts/s during this observation.

It is not possible to determine whether this source is fading given  
the current statistics. Further observations are ongoing to clarify  
the nature of this source.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
