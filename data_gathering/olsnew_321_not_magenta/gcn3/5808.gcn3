H. Mikuz on behalf of PIKA observing program at Crni Vrh Observatory
reports:

We imaged the field of GRB 061110B (SWIFT trigger 238174) with the
60 cm robotic telescope at Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia.

Due to the object low altitude (16 degrees) and presence of some cirrus
clouds, only three 90 second exposures in R filter were secured,
starting 44 s after the trigger was received. Exposure start times (in
UT) are 22:09:46, 22:15:19 and 22:20:52.

No variable object was detected down to a limiting R magnitude 17.2
on single 90 s exposures, nor on three 90 s co-added exposures with
R limiting magnitude 17.8. Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby
USNO A2 stars.
