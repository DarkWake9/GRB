and J. S. Deng(NAOC) report: 

We began to observe GRB 210218A (Sbarufatti al., GCN 29529)
with Xinglong GWAC-F60A telescope, China, at 11:37:45 (UT), 
18th. Feb. 2021, about 146 sec after the burst, under bad seeing condition. 

A series of  R, I images were obtained.
Preliminary analysis shows that no any new optical source
was found in single images within the Swift errorbox (Sbarufatti al., GCN 29529), 
down to the 3 sigma upper limit of 15.0 mag in R band.
The upper limit is calibrated to the USNO B1.0 catalog.

This result is consistent with the previous report (Zhu et al., GCN 29530).
