SUBJECT: GRB 140213A: Swift-XRT observations

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows
(PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), M. Perri (ASDC) and G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 140213A at 20:18:43.0 UT,
3425.3 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 105.15145,
-73.13570 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 00m 36.35s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 08' 08.5"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 69 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.13 x
10^21 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 2.4
(+1.68/-1.51) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
