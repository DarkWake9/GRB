Burrows (PSU), J. D. Gropp (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), J.P.
Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the Fermi-GBM and
Swift/BAT (GUANO)-detected burst GRB 200714E (GCN Circs. 28098 and
28103), collecting 2.2 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+37.3 ks and T0+44.5 ks. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected, it is below the RASS
limit and shows no definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the
present time we cannot confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this
source are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  196.8225  =  13:07:17.41
  Dec (J2000.0): -51.6390  =  -51:38:20.4
  Error: 3.1 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: 0.0138 +/- 0.0033 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 96 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (6.2 +/- 1.5)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021017.

Further observations are planned.
