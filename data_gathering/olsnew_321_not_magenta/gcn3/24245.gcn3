on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190426c at T0 = 
2019-04-26T15:21:55.337 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE 
minicalorimeter (MCAL)  data found no event candidates within a time 
interval covering +/- 100 sec from the LIGO-Virgo T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time 
at different celestial positions within the accessible S190426c  90% 
c.l. localization region (that one which includes the Celestial North 
Pole),  from a minimum of 1.27e-6 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 2.16e-6 erg 
cm^-2  (assuming as spectral model a single power law with photon index 
1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in 
the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in 
progress.
