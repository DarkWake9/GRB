J. Racusin (PSU), D. Grupe (PSU), S. Hunsberger (PSU), and N. Gehrels 
(NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

Swift/XRT began a target of opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL 
detected GRB 060901 (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 5491) at 22:30 UT 
September 1 2006 (~3.8 hours after the burst). We have analyzed the first 
3 orbits of XRT data and we find a previously uncatalogued source at the 
following coordinates:

RA(J2000): 19:08:37.98
Dec(J2000): -6:38:07.84

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.9 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 14.8 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position given in GCN 
Circ. 5491. Further observations and analysis are in progress.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
