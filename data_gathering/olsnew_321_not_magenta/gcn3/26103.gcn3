We observed the field of GRB 191031A (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 26101; Fermi GBM
Team, GCN Circ. 26102) with the COATLI 50-cm telescope and interim imager at the
Observatorio Astron칩mico Nacional on the Sierra de San Pedro M치rtir
(http://coatli.astroscu.unam.mx) from 2019-10-31 02:14 UTC (1.63 hours after the
trigger) to 02:25, obtaining a total of 540 seconds of exposure in the w filter.
The observations were taken at airmasses between 6.4 and 8.3.

We do not detetect any uncataloged sources in the BAT error region to a 10-sigma
limit of w = 18.75.

Our w magnitudes are calibrated against the Pan-STARRS1 catalog, are on an
approximate AB system (Becerra et al., 2019, ApJ, 872, 118), and are not
corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the COATLI technical team and the staff of the Observatorio Astron칩mico
Nacional.
