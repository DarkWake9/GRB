(YNAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130420A (Page et al., GCN 14406) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope. Observations
started at 13:36:00 UT on 2013-04-20 (i.e., 6.13 hrs after the burst, ~2 hrs later than the observation of Xu et al., GCN 14413) and 3x600s R-band and 1x600s I-band images were obtained. The optical counterpart of this burst was detected in both bands. The mag are R~19.4 and I~20.2 calibrated with USNO B1 stars. 
   
We thank the GMG staff, especially Yu-Xin Xin, Gui-Hua He and Jian-Duo He for
performing these observations.
