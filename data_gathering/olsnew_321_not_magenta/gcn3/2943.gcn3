We observed the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20 with the Very Large
Array (VLA) in its A configuration on 2005, January 7, UT 2100-2200.

Preliminary flux levels at epoch Jan 07.90 are as follows (the numbers
in parentheses indicate 1 sigma errors in the last significant figure):

   Frequency  Flux (Jan 07.90)
    (GHz)          (mJy)     
   ---------   ------------   
     1.4           75(5)
     4.8           28(1) 
     8.6           17(1)

The spectrum is consistent with a single power law over this range of
spectral index -0.81+/-0.05, significantly steeper than when the radio
source was first detected on 2005 Jan 3 (GCN #2928, #2929, $2930).
