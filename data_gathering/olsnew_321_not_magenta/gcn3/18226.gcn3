The short-duration GRB 150831A (Swift trigger 648437:
Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 18209; Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 18214;
INTEGRAL detection: Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 18210)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=38049.519 s UT (10:34:09.519).

The burst light curve shows a short pulse with
a total duration of ~1 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(2.4 +/- 0.4)x10^-6 erg/cm2, and a 16-ms peak flux,
measured from T0-0.082 s, of (9.1 +/- 2.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the most intense part of the burst was detected before
the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modeling the 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.108 s to T0+0.912 s) by a power law
with exponential cutoff (CPL) model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -0.5 +/- 0.3, and Ep = 564 +/- 122 keV.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
