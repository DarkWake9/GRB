Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 131024B (trigger #575754)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 15371).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 144.464, 44.284 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  09h 37m 51.3s
    Dec(J2000) = +44d 17' 02.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 40%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows activity starting around T-10 sec and
continuing to ~T+100 sec.  There are several weak peak superimposed.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.00 +- 22 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.59 to T+51.41 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.85 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. 
  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+10.91 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 
0.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
