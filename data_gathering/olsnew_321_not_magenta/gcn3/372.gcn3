on behalf of the ASCA team report :

ASCA is observing the SAX NFI position (GCN #366) of GRB 990704 from
July 5.40(UT).  Preliminary analysis of the first four orbits of the
SIS data at the tracking station shows an X-ray source at a position of

RA(2000)= 184.867
DEC(2000)= -3.833

with the error radius of 1.5 arcmin.  The source is fading and the
average intensity of the four orbits is 2x10E-13 erg/cm2/sec in 2-10
keV band.

ASCA is continuing its observation at least until July 6.13 (UT).
