and Konus-Wind teams, report:

At 07:25:57 UT on February 27, 2009 the KONUS-RF gamma-ray spectrometer 
detected its first gamma-ray burst, GRB 090227A (Fermi/GBM trigger 
257412359 / 090227310: Bissaldi GCN 8917).
That day at 13:43:36 UT the instrument detected a bright short soft 
burst from the AXP/SGR 1E1547.0-5408.
Both bursts also triggered Konus-Wind.

The Konus-RF gamma-ray spectrometer is an instrument of the 
CORONAS-PHOTON solar space observatory that was launched on January 30, 
2009 into a low-Earth low-eccentricity, high-inclination orbit (altitude 
547-592 km, inclination 82.5 deg). CORONAS-PHOTON is a 3-axis 
stabilized, Sun-pointing spacecraft. Konus-RF has been successfully 
operating since February 19.

The Konus-RF experiment is aimed at studying of temporal and spectral 
characteristics of solar flares, gamma-ray bursts, and SGR bursts in a 
wide energy range from 10 keV to 10 MeV. It consists of two identical 
omnidirectional detectors one of which points toward the Sun thereby 
observing the solar hemisphere, and the other observes the antisolar 
hemisphere. Thus, the instrument provides continuous monitoring of the 
unocculted sky. However, the usable exposure time is severely limited by 
passage through the radiation belts at high latitudes and the South 
Atlantic Anomaly. Each detector employs NaI(Tl) crystal, 127 mm in 
diameter and 76.2 mm in height, supplied with a beryllium entrance 
window. The Konus-RF instrument is an advanced modification of the 
Russian-American Konus-Wind spectrometer. More details can be found at
