SUBJECT: GRB 071025: I-detection, R-dropout?

  M. Im, I. Lee (Seoul National University), and Y. Urata
  (Saitama University) on behalf of the EAFON team:

   Using the Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) 1.0m telescope
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute,
  we observed GRB071025, beginning at 04:35 UT on Oct 25.
   We have a clear detection of the afterglow in 300 secs frame
  taken in I-band (GCN6987, Rykoff et al.),
  but no detection at all in B, V, R-band with the same exposure
  time.  The non-detection R-band suggests that the GRB is
  likely a R-band dropout at z ~ 6.

   This message may be cited.

   We acknowldege the help of the LOAO operators, J.H. Yoon,
  for this observation.
