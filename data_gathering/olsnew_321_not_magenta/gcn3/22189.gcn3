A. Melandri, P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), L. di Fabrizio, C. Padilla (INAF-TNG), V. D'Elia (ASI/ASDC) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:


We observed the field of GRB 171205AA (D'Elia et al. GCN 22177) with the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) equipped with NICS. Observations were carried out in the near-infrared with the JHK filter, starting on Dec 06 at 05:25:09 UT (~0.92 days after the burst) and consisted in a series of images for a total exposure time of 15 minutes per filter.

We clearly detect the optical counterpart (Izzo et al. GCN 22180; Emery & D'Elia GCN 22181; Butler et al. GCN 22182; Mao et al. 22186; de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 22187; Choi et al. GCN 22188) in each filter. In our preliminary analysis the source is detected with a magnitude of J = 16.7 +/- 0.1 at a mid time of 0.922 days from the burst event (calibrated against nearby stars reported in the 2MASS catalogue).

Further observations are planned.
