B. Zauderer, T. Laskar and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 121024A (Pagani et al; GCN 13886) with
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy beginning 2012
Oct 25.5 (dt=1.4 d after the burst).  At a mean frequency of ~85 GHz, we 
detect a radio counterpart with a preliminary flux of ~1 mJy within the 
enhanced Swft/XRT error circle (Osborne et al; GCN 13894) and consistent 
with the optical afterglow (e.g. Knust et al.; GCN 13891).
We thank the CARMA observers and staff for their support.  Followup 
observations are planned."
