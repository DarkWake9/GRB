The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 04:29:52 UT on 26 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200826A (trigger 620108997.570644 / 200826187).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 4.7, Dec = 35.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 18m, 35d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 73.0 degrees.
