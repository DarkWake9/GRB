At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S191109d, T0 = 2019-11-09 01:07:17.221 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 26202), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-29 min to T0+3 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy 
trigger mode at the trigger time of S191109d. Using the CAL data,
we have searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band 
from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no 
candidates. There is no significant overlap with the LVC high 
probability localization region at T0+-60 sec.  The CAL FOV was
centered at RA=349.9 deg, Dec=-16.6 deg at T0.
