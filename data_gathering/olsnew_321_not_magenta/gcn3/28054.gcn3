Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200701A (trigger #980421)
(Bernardini et al., GCN Circ. 28052).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 123.563, -14.553 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 14m 15.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -14d 33' 09.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that
starts at ~T-7 s and peaks at ~T0. The main pulse ends at ~T+20 s,
followed by a weak tail that lasts till ~T+40 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 38.9 +- 8.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.81 to T+42.17 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.91 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 9.3 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T-1.72 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
