The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:12:33 UT on 6 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190806A (trigger 586800758.324292 / 190806675).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 121.1, Dec = -75.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 04m, -75d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
