D. M. Smith, and K. Hurley on behalf of the RHESSI team report:

As observed by RHESSI, GRB061007 (Schady et al., GCN 5707; Markwardt et
al., GCN 5713) had a duration of ~73s starting at about T0=10:08:08 UT.
The preliminary fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum of the main
period of emission from (T0+27s) - (T0+64s) between 34 keV and 6 MeV
is a Band function with

alpha = -0.90 +0.27/-0.23
beta = -3.07 +0.40/-1.68
Epeak = 391 +58/-52 keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 20 keV-10 MeV fluence is 1.85 +0.12/-0.10 E-4 erg/cm^2.
