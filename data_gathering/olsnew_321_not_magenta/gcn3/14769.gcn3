C. Rumsey (MRAO) report on behalf of the 4 Pi Sky / AMI team:

We have observed the position of the GRB 130603B afterglow at multiple
epochs with the AMI Large Array at 15 GHz. Our initial observation was
for one hour starting at 15:53:42 UT on June 3rd, just under 5 minutes
after the GRB trigger time (GCN 14735). We also made longer observations,
at 3.12 and 22.8 hours post-burst. We do not detect the afterglow
in our preliminary reductions.

Preliminary analysis gives 3-sigma upper limits as follows:

Start (Hrs post burst) | Duration (hrs) |   3-sigma upper limit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      0.08                       |            1          |      0.6 mJy
      3.12                       |            3          |      0.21 mJy
    22.8                         |            3          |      0.3 mJy

Further observations are scheduled.

These observations were initially triggered via the system described in
Staley et. al (2013, MNRAS, 428, 3114).
