The robotic telescope REM observed the field of GRB040903 (IBAS #alert 1972,
Gotz et al., GCN 2690) with the IR camera REMIR in the filter H starting on
Sept. 03 at UT 22:58, 4.67 hrs after the first INTEGRAL alert.
Due to the poor weather conditions only one set of five 1s dithered images,
for a total exposure time of 5s, was acquired. The acquisition and image
preprocessing were done automatically. The photometry was calibrated with
a subset of the 2MASS catalog.
Off-line analysis revealed no evident new sources, compared to the 2MASS
catalog, within the error circle of INTEGRAL. 
The detection upper limit (3 sigma) is H=15.2 and the extinction in the area 
is A_H=2.56.
