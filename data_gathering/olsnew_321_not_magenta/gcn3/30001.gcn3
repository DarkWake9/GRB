C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-210510A
(GCN 29976), the reported position:

RA: 268.42 (+1.47, -1.60 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 3.81 (+0.68, -0.64 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately
24.1 minutes prior until 10.4 minutes after event time. Therefore, 
the GBM observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
