We performed forced photometry on ZTF images from 2019-08-15 UT at the
location of DESGW-190814a reported in GCN #25336. The field was
observed 3 times in r-band and 2 times in g-band, and no source was
detected above a 5 sigma threshold at the reported location. The
combined 5 sigma upper limit at the location of the source is g = 21.1
mag and r = 21.7 mag. Based on the i and z-band detections reported in
GCN #25336, these upper limits indicate red colors of r - i > 1.1 mag
and r - z > 1.4 mag.
