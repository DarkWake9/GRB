A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 170403A has been detected by
Fermi (GBM; Roberts and Meegan, GCN Circ. 20975), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL 
(SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 50358 s UT (13:59:18).
The burst was probably outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   259.339 (17h 17m 21s) +18.373 (+18d 22' 24")
  Corners:
   259.284 (17h 17m 08s) +20.795 (+20d 47' 43")
   259.729 (17h 18m 55s) +15.801 (+15d 48' 04")
   259.375 (17h 17m 30s) +16.007 (+16d 00' 24")
   258.911 (17h 15m 39s) +21.035 (+21d 02' 06")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.63 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 5.29 deg (the minimum one is 19.4 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 110 deg.

This box may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
