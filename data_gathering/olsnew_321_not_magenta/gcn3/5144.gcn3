of the Swift Team:

At 06:43:34 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060516 (trigger=210254).  Swift did not slew because
of the Sun observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 71.178, -18.113 {04h 44m 43s, -18d 06' 47"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the BAT TDRSS
lightcurve shows nothing above background noise.  We will have to wait
for the full data downlink (T+2 hrs) to tell more about this burst.
