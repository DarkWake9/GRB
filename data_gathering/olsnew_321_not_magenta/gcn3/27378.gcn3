Xin (Yunnan Observatories of CAS), on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

Following the detection of SGR Swift J1818.0-1607 by Swift (Evans et al. 
GCNC 27373), the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang 
Astronomical Observatory (China) gathered images starting at 21:17:34 UT 
(47 s after trigger). No optical afterglow is found down to 19.3 mag (in 
co-added 10x10 s unfiltered images) within the Swift/XRT error box, 
consistent with the non-detection by Swift/UVOT (Evans et al. GCNC 
27373). Further observations are ongoing.
