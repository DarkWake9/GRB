Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 140423A (trigger #596901) (Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 16142).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 197.276, 49.838 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 09m 06.2s
   Dec(J2000) = +49d 50' 18.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 39%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peak episode
starting ~T-50 sec, highest peak at ~T+45 sec, and the episode
ends around ~T+140 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 134 +- 23 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-130.13 to T+108.91 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model. The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.33 +- 0.06. The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 9.4 +- 0.3 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+44.19 sec in
the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
