We observed the field of GRB 161014A (Racusin, et al., GCN 20035) with
the Reionization
and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2016/10 16.16 to 2016/10 16.26 UTC (39.29 to 41.69 hours
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.78 hours exposure in the r
and i bands and 0.75 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Mingo, et al., GCN 20050)
and reported in Golkhou, et al. (GCN 20052), in comparison with the SDSS
DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detection and upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r > 23.79
  i 23.57 +/- 0.32
  Z > 22.72
  Y > 22.57
  J > 22.20
  H > 21.91

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
