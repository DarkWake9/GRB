A. Volnova (SAI MSU/IKI), L. Elenin (KIAM),  V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), 
A.Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 120802A (Holland et al., GCN 13555) with 
Shajn telescope of CrAO starting on Aug. 15 (UT) 23:00:26. We took several 
images in R-filter under mean seeing of 2.8".  In a stacked image we do not 
detect the object suggested as optical counterpart of GRB 120802A (Elenin et 
al., GCN 13609) up to 22.5 m. Thus we can confirm the object reported in 
(Elenin et al., GCN 13609) is most probably is an afterglow of  GRB 120802A. 
A photometry of  the filed is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 (R2) stars:

   T0+,    Filter      Exposure, OT,  UL (3 sigma)
  mid, d                  (s)

13.625    R           3540          n/d         22.5

We are grateful for CCD PL4240 provided by ISON for Shajn telescope.
