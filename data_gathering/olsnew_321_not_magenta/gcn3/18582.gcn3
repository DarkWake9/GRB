report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 08:33:20.03 UT on 11 November 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 151111A (trigger 468923604 / 151111356),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(McCauley et al. 2015, GCN 18578).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 50 degrees.
The GBM light curve consists of a single FRED-like episode
with a duration (T90) of about 40 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to T0+30 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is 0.0 ± 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 107 ± 8 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.05 ± 0.13)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.41 ± 0.17 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
