report:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW Binary Merger Candidate G296853 on Aug 
9, 08:28 UT (GCNC 21431), a mosaic of unfiltered images covering 80% of 
the GraceDB skymap (above -45 in Dec) was taken starting on Aug 10, 
01:30 UT (i.e. 17 hr later) with the wide-field imager at the BOOTES-1 
station located at the ESAt/INTA-CEDEA in Mazagón (Huelva, Spain), down 
to a R = 12 limiting magnitude. In addition to this, data for several 
selected fields within the skymap center were gathered the same night 
with the 10.4m GTC telescope (+OSIRIS spectrograph) in riz filters down 
to R = 21.5, with the images quality being affected by the nearby full 
moon and the poor transparency due to the dust from Sahara. A more 
detailed analysis of the data is in progress.
