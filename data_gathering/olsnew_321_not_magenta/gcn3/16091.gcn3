We observed the field of GRB 140408A (D'Elia, et al., GCN 16082) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/04 9.41 to 2014/04 9.48
UTC (20.52 to 22.37 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
1.42 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle we obtain the following
upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 22.84
  i     > 22.53

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. These upper limits are consistent
with the previously reported GROND afterglow candidate (Varela, et al.,
GCN 16089).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
