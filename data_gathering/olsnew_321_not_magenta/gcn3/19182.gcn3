B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:32:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160314A (trigger=679120).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 112.781, +17.001 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 31m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = +17d 00' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec. The peak count rate
was ~1700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:34:22.7 UT, 91.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 112.7891, 16.9987 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 31m 09.39s
   Dec(J2000) = +16d 59' 55.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 29 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
151 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.08. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
