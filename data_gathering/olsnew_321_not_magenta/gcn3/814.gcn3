J. Hjorth, B. L. Jensen, and H. Pedersen (U. of Copenhagen), 
J. U. P. Fynbo and P. Moller (ESO), J. Gorosabel (DSRI, Copenhagen)
report on behalf of a larger European GRB collaboration:

Further to GCN #809, we report an additional NOT R-band data point
obtained on Sept. 28.9595 UT: R=20.889+-0.035. We note that if we 
exclude the preliminary data point of Halpern et al. (GCN #806) and 
include the data point of Price et al. (GCN #811) the lightcurve is 
consistent with a pure power law decay with a decay index of 
-1.66 +- 0.02. Further monitoring of the optical afterglow is needed 
to distinguish a pure power law and a broken power law decay. A 
finding chart, a lightcurve and predictions for the coming days are 
posted at http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb000926/ ."
