The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:52:58 UT on 7 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200507A (trigger 610559583.838602 / 200507662).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 57.8, Dec = 65.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 51m, 65d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 46.0 degrees.
