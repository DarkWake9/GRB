The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the IceCube-191122A (2019-11-22 22:45:10) the spacecraft
was preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2162 and 2163 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2019-11-22T19:36:55 and
2019-11-23T04:41:51.
