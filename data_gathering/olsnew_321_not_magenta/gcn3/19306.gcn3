report:

We observed the location of the short GRB 160410A (Gibson et al., 
GCN Circ. 19271) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera 
on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 
05:54 UT on 2016-04-10, corresponding to 45 minutes after the burst 
trigger.  Exposures totaling 2.0 hours were made in good weather 
conditions.  No source was detected, with the RMS background noise 
being 1.3 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 12.5 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Callie Matulonis, Lianghao Lin, and Iain Coulson for the prompt 
support of these observations that were taken under project M16AP005.
