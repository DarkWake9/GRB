P. Schady (MSSL/UCL) and S. Pandey (MSSL/UCL) report on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began taking data in the field of GRB061007 on 2006-10-07, 80s 
after the BAT trigger (Schady et al., GCN 5707), discounting the 10s settling 
image. The afterglow reported by Rykoff & Rujopakarn (GCN 5706), is clearly 
detected in all six UVOT lenticular filters, and decaying rapidly with a decay 
index of ~1.6. The refined position of the afterglow is RA = 03:05:19.6, Dec= 
-50:30:02.4 (J2000).

The magnitude of the afterglow in each UVOT filter are given below for the 
first exposure taken, and the first long exposure of duration 197s. In the case 
of the UVW2 filter, the exposures after 619s after the BAT trigger
had to be coadded to get a detection.

Filter  T+(s)   Exp(s)  Mag
V       395     393     12.84 +/- 0.01
         6397    197     17.93 +/- 0.01

B       678     10      14.42 +/- 0.08
         5783    197     18.30 +/- 0.08

U       657     19      14.13 +/- 0.05
         5578    197     17.77 +/- 0.07

UVW1    635     19      14.89 +/- 0.08
         6807    197     19.29 +/- 0.31

UVM2    611     19      16.10 +/- 0.15
         6602    197	20.30 +/- 0.69 (1sig)

UVW2    711     19      16.75 +/- 0.17
         14813   1279    20.96 +/- 0.36 (1sig)

T+ is the start time of the exposure since the BAT trigger. In the second 
reported UVW2 exposure T+ is the midtime of 3 coadded exposures. These 
magnitudes are not corrected for the expected extinction of E(B-V)=0.021, 
or for coincidince loss.
