R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Upon further analysis, the LCO observations reported in GCN 27792 clearly show two possible sources consistent with the XRT enhanced position (Beardmore et al., GCN 27780).
One source is located at ra, dec=(00:22:43.66,-00:16:58.59), 0.72 arc seconds from the center of the XRT enhanced position. The magnitudes of this source are the following:

R = 22.57 +/- 0.29
I > 20.39

A second source, which is located at ra, dec=(00:22:43.69,-00:16:57.37), 1.08 arcesonds from the center of the XRT localization is likely consistent with the potential host galaxy and magnitude were reported in GCN 27792.

At this moment it is not possible to determine if any of these objects is related to the short GRB 200522A, but further observations have been scheduled to determine possible variability.

We apologize for any confusion our earlier analysis may have caused.
