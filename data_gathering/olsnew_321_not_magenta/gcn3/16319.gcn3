Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:34:18.73 UT on 21 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140521A (trigger 422386461 / 140521732)
which was also detected by Swift (E. Troja et al. 2014, GCN 16311).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The GBM light curve consists of one main episode with a total
duration (T90) of about 11.5 s (50-300keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-0.864 s to T0+10.400 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.04 +/- 0.08 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 273 +/- 44 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.99 +/- 0.21)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.10 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 3.9 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
