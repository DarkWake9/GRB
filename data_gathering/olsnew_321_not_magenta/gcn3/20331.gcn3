Hualin Xiao (PSI), Wojtek Hajdas (PSI) and Radek Marcinkowski (PSI) report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2016-12-19T18:48:39.0 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 161219B,
which was also observed by Swift BAT (trigger #727541).

The POLAR light curve consists of one peak with duration (T90) of 4.0 +- 0.5 s measured from T0.
The  0.5 s peak flux at T0+1.75 s  is equal to 248 +-44 cnts/sec.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 80 - 500 keV.

Using the best location from the Swift BAT, which is (J2000):

RA: 91.717  [deg]
	
Dec: -26.790  [deg]

the incident angle in the POLAR coordinate at T0 is:

Theta: 96.6  [deg]

Phi:  201.2 [deg]

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Calibration of the instrument is ongoing.

POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which was launched on-board the Chinese space
laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
