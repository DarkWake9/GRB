The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:59:49 UT on 10 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190610B (trigger 581882394.908204 / 190610750).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 327.4, Dec = 42.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 49m, 42d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
