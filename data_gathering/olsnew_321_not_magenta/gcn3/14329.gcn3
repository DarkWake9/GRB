"At 04:51:54.30 UT on 25 March 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130325A (trigger 385879917 / 130325203).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 130.71, DEC = -21.12 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 08 h 42 m, -21 d 07 '), with an uncertainty
of 2.15 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51.0 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright pulse
with a duration (T90) of 9.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.003 s to T0+9.216 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 202.20 (+17.50/-15.60) keV,
alpha = -0.73 (+0.06/-0.05), and beta = -2.18 (+0.09/-0.12).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.25 +/- 0.27)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 12.9 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
