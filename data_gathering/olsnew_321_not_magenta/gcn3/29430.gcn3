WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 210207B (Lien et al.,

GCN 29420) starting at ~0.657 days after the trigger.

A total of 20x60s images were obtained in the clear (roughly R) filters.

We marginally detect the optical afterglow (Lien et al., GCN 29420;

Kumar et al., GCN 29421) in the coadd image with a mag of 20.3 +/- 0.3,

calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
