The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:08:15 UT on 2 Jan 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 080102A (trigger 220982896.414242 / 080102672).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 39.7, Dec = 69.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 38m, 69d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 149.0 degrees.
