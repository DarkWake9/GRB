P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 190114A, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 65.5439, 2.1913 which
is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 04 22 10.54
   Dec (J2000) = +02 11 28.6
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence).
Analysis of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/883600.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
