Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of Swift/BAT trigger #1017711
(Moss, et al., GCN Circ. 29323).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 282.822, -61.767 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  18h 51m 17.4s 
  Dec(J2000) = -61d 45' 59.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 92%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike with a FRED-like shape,
rising sharply at T+0 sec and decaying to background by T+0.1 sec. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.06 +- 0.02 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.00 to T+0.08 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.41 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 0.9 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

In the original GCN circular, it was discussed that this event could be either a
previously unknown Soft Gamma Repeater (Swift J1851.2-6148) or short GRB 210119A.
While the BAT data alone is insufficient for us to make a definitive judgement as to the
nature of the source, our assessment of these data suggests that the event was more 
likely a short GRB for the following reasons.  First, the spectrum is rather hard, and the
position of the burst on the T90-hardness diagram is within the population of short GRBs.
Second, the light curve shows a FRED (fast rise, exponential decay) profile, more 
consistent with a GRB than with an SGR flare.  Third, the event location is 35 degrees 
away from the center of the galactic bulge.
