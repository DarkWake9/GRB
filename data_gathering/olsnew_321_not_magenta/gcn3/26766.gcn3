The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the S200115j (2020-01-15 04:23:09, GCN #26759) the 
spacecraft was
preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2182 and 2183 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2020-01-14 23:52:28 and
2020-01-15 09:24:40.
