Gehrels (GSFC), report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT observed the field of GRB 050326 beginning at 10:48:14 
UT.  The instrument was in Auto State and attempted to calculate a 
centroid, but found only 7 photons in 2.5 seconds from the GRB position, 
insufficient to obtain an on-board centroid.  Based on 335 seconds of 
Photon-Counting mode observations from the first orbit of data, we find a 
bright uncataloged X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 0:27:48.7,
Dec(J2000) = -71:22:17.2

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds.   This source is located 
83 arcseconds from the BAT position given in GCN 3145.
