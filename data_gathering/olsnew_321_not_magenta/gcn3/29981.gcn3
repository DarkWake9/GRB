The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 19:20:00 UT on 10 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210510A (trigger 642367205.830352 / 210510806).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 192.3, Dec = 44.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 49m, 44d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 21.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
