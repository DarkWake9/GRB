At the time of the event (2020-09-26 07:54:11 UTC, hereafter T0),
INTEGRAL was nearing the end of orbit, and although the data is available,
the excess variance due to local background environment was extreme
(excess variance 54), preventing search for any but the most intense 
counterparts, which would have been clearly detected by other instruments.
