Using the data set from T-239 to T+454 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080413A (trigger #309096)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 7594).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 287.301, -27.677 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 09m 12.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 40' 36.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 81%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows four peaks.  The first starting at T-0.1 sec,
peaking at T+2.0 sec.  The second peak overlaps with the first and peaks
at ~T+7 sec.  The third and fourth peaks are well separated with peaks
at T+16 and T+47 sec, repsectively.  The lightcurve returns to baseline
at ~T+80 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 46 +- 1 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+50.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
