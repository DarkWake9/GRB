P. Romano (INAF-IASFPA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 09:52:43 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located the SFXT IGR J16479-4514 (trigger=599041).  Due to higher
priority follow-up of GRB 140515A, Swift did not slew to this object. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 252.039, -45.200 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 48m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 12' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for imaging triggers,
this event is not obvious in the on-board BAT light curve. 

Previously, Swift observed flares from this Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient on 
2005 August 30 (Sidoli et al. 2008, ApJ, 687, 1230),   
2006 May 20 (Markwardt & Krimm 2006, ATel #816),  
2006 June 24, 
2007 July 29, 
2008 March 19 (Romano et al. 2008, ApJ, 680, L137), 
2008 May 21, 
and 2009 January 29 (Romano et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 2021). 
The historical light curve from the BAT hard X-ray transient monitor 
(Krimm et al, 2013, ApJS, 209, 14; 15-50 keV) can be found at
