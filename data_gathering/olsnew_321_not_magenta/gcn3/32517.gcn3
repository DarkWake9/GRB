The new General Coordinates Network (GCN Circular #32419) is
pleased to announce self-service configuration of GCN Notice
notifications over email. This new feature will greatly simplify
and enhance the user experience for subscribing to GCN Notices.
Using the same accounts on https://gcn.nasa.gov as GCN Classic
Over Kafka, users can now sign up to subscribe to any of the
public GCN Notice types in any of the 3 legacy formats (text,
binary, VOEvent), and edit their settings at will.

To get started, sign in or sign up at https://gcn.nasa.gov, and
then select "Email Notifications" from the account dropdown menu.
Note that signing up for receiving emails via the new GCN does not
edit usersâ€™ prior subscriptions to GCN Classic. When you would
like to unsubscribe from GCN Classic, please contact us via:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=gcnclassic
