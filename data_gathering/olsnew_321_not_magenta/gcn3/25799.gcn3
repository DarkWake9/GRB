The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:45:55 UT on 21 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190921A (trigger 590777160.12475 / 190921699).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 338.4, Dec = -63.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 33m, -63d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
