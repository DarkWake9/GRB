TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4956
SUBJECT: GRB060403: optical observations
DATE:    06/04/11 19:50:37 GMT
FROM:    Alexei Pozanenko at IKI, Moscow  <apozanen@iki.rssi.ru>

D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT, La Palma),  A. Pozanenko (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP),
M. Ibrahimov (MAO), and V. Rumyantsev (CrAO) on behalf of larger GRB follow
up collaboration report:

We observed the error-box of GRB060403 (Boyd et al.  GCN 4945) with 1.5m
telescope of Sayan Observatory (Mondy)  in R and V-bands on Apr.3 between
(UT) 19:44 and 21:10 under poor weather conditions and with 1.5m telescope
of  Maidanak Astronomical Observatory on Apr. 03  (UT) 22:36 - 22:59 and on
Apr. 05 in R-band. Several images were obtained in each epochs.  Telescope
of   Sayan Observatory equipped with SC3 CCD camera 1040x1160, 16mkm,  FOV =
2'x2'.

Observations of Maidanak observatory are deeper than DSS2 and  within
refined XRT error box (Mangano et al. GCN 4947) few objects were found which
are not presented in DSS2 R. All  found objects are presented in both epochs
and most probably are not related with GRB060403.

The limiting  magnitudes of the observations are based on USNO A2.0:

Mid. time,   Filter,  Limit,  Seeing
(UT)
Apr.3.819     R      17.5    ~2.5"
Apr.3.876     V      18.8    ~2.0"
Apr.3.942     R      21.2    ~1.1"
Apr.5.994     R      20.5    ~1.4"

Results are preliminary; the images can be found in
