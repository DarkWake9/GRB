Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Jyri Lehtinen (Univ. Helsinki), and Pall 
Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140817A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 16695) with 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC camera. 
Observations were carried out starting on 2014 Aug 20.23 UT (2.94 days 
after the GRB), at high airmass and in twilight, for a total exposure of 
15 min.

No source is detected at the position of the UVOT optical afterglow 
(Marshall & Sbarufatti, GCN 16710) nor within the XRT error circle 
(Sbarufatti, GCN 16696; Osborne et al., GCN 16697) down to a 3-sigma 
limiting magnitude of R = 21 (calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 catalog).

The galaxy MCG +10-12-141 at z ~ 0.018, around 1 arcmin away of the XRT 
position, is well detected in our images (Cummings & Page, GCN 16698). 
We note that a supernova similar to SN 1998bw would have R ~ 17.5 at z = 
0.018 at a comparable epoch. We thus disfavor the association of GRB 
140817A with the nearby galaxy.
