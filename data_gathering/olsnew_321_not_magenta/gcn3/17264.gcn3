Burrows (PSU), C. Pagani (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester),
P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC) and
A. Vargas report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 150101A (Vargas  et al. GCN
Circ. 17261),  from 68 s to 18.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 17262). The source
is fading with alpha >0.6.


If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of ,
the count rate at T+24 hours will be 7.9 x 10^-5 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
