report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:19:51.61 UT on 29 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201029A (trigger 625695596 / 201029847)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Dichiara et al., GCN 28803).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a broad peak
with a duration (T90) of about 78 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-8.2 s to T0+34.8 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.03 +/- 0.10 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 647 +/- 230 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.59 +/- 0.14)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.4 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.



The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
