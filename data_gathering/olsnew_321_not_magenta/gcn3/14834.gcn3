Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130609A (trigger #557782)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 14828).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 152.680, 24.124 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  10h 10m 43.2s
    Dec(J2000) = +24d 07' 27.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 87%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
7.0 +- 0.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.19 to T+7.28 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.88 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
