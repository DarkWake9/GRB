J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU) and N. Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf 
of the Swift/XRT Team:

Swift began a target of opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL discovered 
burst GRB 050922A (GCN 4007) at 15:21:21 UT on September 22nd, 2005. 
Analysis of ground processed XRT data reveals no point source inside the 
INTEGRAL error circle. We estimate a 90% confidence level upper limit on 
the X-ray flux from this burst of 3 x 10^-14 erg/s (0.5 - 10 keV).
