We observed the field of GRB 160327A (Racusin, et al., GCN 19235) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/03 28.14 to 2016/03 28.39 UTC (17.98 to
24.15 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.21 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.76 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Goad, et al., GCN 19237),
in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections:

  r	23.84 +/- 0.22
  i	23.29 +/- 0.14
  Z	22.57 +/- 0.20
  Y	22.83 +/- 0.35
  J	22.43 +/- 0.29
  H	21.75 +/- 0.23

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction
in the direction of the GRB. Compared to our previous night of observations
(Golkhou et al., GCN 19236), the source flux has decayed substantially in
all bands. The source r - i color changes from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 0.6 +/-
0.3 between our first and the second night observations. The strong color
change suggests the possibility of contamination by the GRB host galaxy at
late-time.

Mártir.
