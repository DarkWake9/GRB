On 10 December, from 00:38 UT - 09:27 UT, the Chandra Observatory 
targeted the field of the X-ray rich gamma-ray burst XRF011130 that 
was previously localized by the HETE satellite (Ricker et al., GCN 
1165). The revised error circle for XRF011130 (Ricker et al. GCN 
1178) fits completely within the field-of-view of the ACIS-I array on 
Chandra.  The observation duration was 30 ksec.

In Ricker et al. (GCN 1185), we reported the locations of the 
brightest 10 X-ray sources established in our Chandra observation. 
In this Circular, we complete the list of detected sources by 
presenting all sources found in the entire ACIS-I detector 
field-of-view down to a limit of 10 detected counts, including the 
sources presented in GCN Circular #1185.  The information for sources 
outside the 7.6' radius HETE error circle are presented in a separate 
table for clarity.  The analysis reported here is based on 
wavedetect, whereas GCN 1185 was based on celldetect.  The results 
are similar: nine of the celldetect sources appear among the top ten 
wavedetect sources.

The following table includes all sources above a limit of 10 detected 
counts found within the HETE error circle (radius 7.6').  Sources 
marked with a * were found by celldetect and distributed in GCN 1185.

The astrometry was calibrated using five USNO A2 catalog stars.

In the table, delta(RA), the uncertainty in RA, and delta(DEC),the 
uncertainty in DEC, were established by summing the following in 
quadrature for each coordinate: the error reported by wavedetect, the 
error reported by the correlation code, and the error estimate from 
the star reference catalog.

It is notable that during our Chandra observation there were no 
counts detected from within the error circle of the VLA radio source 
reported by Berger and Frail (GCN 1173).

Further information about the Chandra observations, including 23 
additional sources down to the detection limit of the observation, 
can be found on the HETE web page:
