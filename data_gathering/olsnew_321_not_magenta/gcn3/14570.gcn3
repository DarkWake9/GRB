D. Xu (DARK/NBI), C. Cao, S.-M. Hu, J.-M. Ai (SDU) report:

We observed the field of GRB 130505A (Cannizzo et al., GCN 14563) with
the 1m telescope located in Weihai, Shandong Province, China. We
obtained 2x600s frames in the solan r-filter with a mean time of
3.3724 hr after the BAT trigger.

The optical afterglow is clearly detected at the UVOT position with
r=18.4 +/- 0.1 mag, calibrated against the SDSS field.
