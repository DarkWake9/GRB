"Using the Danish 1.54m+DFOSC (La Silla), we have obtained R-band images
of the field of the SXC-source associated with GRB 050709.94 (Butler et
al., GCN#3570) for two nights (July 11.3 and 12.3 UT) under good
conditions (0.7" and 1.0" seeing, respectively). At the location of the
Chandra source (Fox et al., GCN#3585), we clearly detect the object
present on the DSS.

In the image with the best seeing (the first night), this object
resolves into two sources separated by about 1". The 0.5" Chandra
error-circle covers the fainter, eastern-most, of these two sources.

In the image from the second night, the objects are not clearly
resolved. Aperture photometry of both objects together in the two epochs
(at t+33h and t+56h) do not indicate significant R-band variability.

Images of the objects are shown at:
