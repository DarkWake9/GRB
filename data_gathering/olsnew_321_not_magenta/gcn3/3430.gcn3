NUMBER:  3430
SUBJECT: GRB 050520 - A long GRB detected with INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/05/20 01:07:08 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck
(ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS
Localization Team report:

A 80 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:05:53 
on May 20 2005.
Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  192.5087 [degrees]
DEC: +30.4506 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.7 
ph (5E-08 erg)/cmsq/s. Its fluence (20-200 keV, 80 s integration time) is 
28.6 ph (2.4E-06 erg)/cmsq.

A plot of the multi peaked light curve will be posted at

Note that this burst is located at high galactic latitude (b=+86 deg) and 
not affected by Galactic absorption. It is therefore a good target for 
optical follow-up searches.
