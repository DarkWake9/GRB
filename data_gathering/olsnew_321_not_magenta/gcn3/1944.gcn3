Ulysses, RHESSI, and HETE-FREGATE observed this GRB at 67757 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 150 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 160.920, 41.819 degrees, whose radius is 85.870 +/-  0.122
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved,  but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
