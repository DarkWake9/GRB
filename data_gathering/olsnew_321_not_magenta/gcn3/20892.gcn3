report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 170317A (LaPorte et al., GCN 20885)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 09:54 UT on 17th March, 8 min after
the BAT trigger, to 10:38 UT. The total exposure of 17.0 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 20887) down to
the limiting magnitude of Ks=16.1 (Vega, S/N=5). The photometric
calibration was made against 2MASS field stars.
