David Bersier (LJMU) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The Faulkes Telescopes North (Hawaii) and South (Australia) both started 
automatically (110 and 182 seconds after trigger)  to observe GRB 
110731A, in response to the Swift trigger 458448.  The software detected 
a uncatalogued decaying source that coincides with the position of the 
UVOT candidate afterglow (GCN 12215).
We measure a magnitude mR=16.4 at 28 minutes after the trigger time. 
Assuming a  power law decay, the decay index is about -1.

Observations have been obtained with the BVR filters and are continuing 
on both telescopes.
