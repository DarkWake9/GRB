report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 2016-05-19 00:17:33.55 UT on 19 May 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 160519A (trigger 485309857 /
160519012), which was also detected by Swift (D'Avanzo et al., GCN
19436). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift
position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight to the best location is 52 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple, weak emission episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 97 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.6 s to T0+40.4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.97 +/- 0.25 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 61.7 +/- 7.3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.4 +/- 0.1)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak = 51 +/- 11 keV, alpha = -0.67 +/- 0.51 and beta = -2.51 +/- 0.36.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
