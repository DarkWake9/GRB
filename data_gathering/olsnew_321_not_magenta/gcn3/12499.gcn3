TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  12499
SUBJECT: GRB 111029A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    11/10/29 10:11:34 GMT
FROM:    Wiphu Rujopakarn at U AZ/Steward  <rujopakarn@gmail.com>

W. Rujopakarn (Steward), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), T. Guver (U
Arizona), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
111029A (Swift trigger 506519; Troja, GCN 12498), producing images
beginning 7.7 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took
the first image at 09:46:34.7 UT, 114.2 s after the burst, under
excellent conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 20 60-sec
exposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO
A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle, for both
single images and coadding into sets of 10; the field is not crowded.
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.9-17.6; we
set the following specific limits.
