"At 21:44:09.64 UT on 15 July 2013, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 130715A (trigger 
395617452 / 130715.906). The on-ground calculated location, using 
the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 287.4, Dec = -31.1 (J2000 
degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 9m, -31d 3'), with a statistical 
uncertainty of 1.0 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical 
only; there is additionally a systematic error which is currently 
estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi LAT 
boresight is 96 degrees.

The trigger occurred during a nadir pointing maneuver of
the Fermi spacecraft.

The GBM light curve shows single continuous emission with a 
duration (T90) of about 48 s (50-300 keV).  The peak flux during 
this interval is 7.75 +/- 0.31 ph/s/cm^2. The time-averaged 
spectrum from T0+0.00 to T0+61.44 s is best fit by a Band function
with Epeak = 314.60 +/- 12.40, alpha = -0.58 +/- 0.03, 
beta = -2.44 +/- 0.12. The fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval 
is (4.7 +/- 0.061)E-05 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
