Further to GCN 18786, we report spectroscopic classification of 7
of the Pan-STARRS transients within the northern localisation region
of G211117. Spectra were taken with GMOS on the Gemini North 8m
telescope (program GN-2015B-Q-4, PI. K. Chambers), with the R150
grating, filter GG455, and 1 arcsec slit giving useful wavelength
coverage 5000-9600 Angs. Typical exposure times were 600s, and the
spectra are of high quality (S/N 20-100). The data were taken on
the nights of 2015-12-30 and 2015-12-31 (with the MJDs of the
exposures given in parentheses below)

PS15dpn (57387.23)
Has a very blue continuum, with three weak (but real) emission line
features. These are tentatively identified as He I 5015.68, 5875.60
and H-alpha at z=0.175, although this is by no means certain as
two of them coincide with the strong telluric absorptions. The
transient was discovered on our first scan of the region on
2015-12-28 and is still rising, slowly (0.6 mag in 4 days, now
at i=19.9). This is an unusual spectrum and further
multi-wavelength observations are encouraged. Further spectra
are planned by our team.

PS15dow (57387.21): type Ib  (z=0.05 +/- 0.01) at +9 (SN1999ex) to +30d
(SN2008D) after maximum light. Therefore, explosion at least 20-40d 
before the GW trigger

PS15dpc (57387.26): type II z=0.056, +15-25d after explosion.
Therefore explosion 10-29d before the GW trigger.

PS15dpl (57387.40): type  Ia (z=0.03 +0.05/-0.015), at -8 to -11d before
peak. Assuming 17+/-1 days for rise time of type Ia SNe, this suggests
explosion 2015-12-21 to 2015-12-26. Which brackets the GW detection,
within the uncertainties. However as an apparently normal SN Ia, it
would appear unrelated.

PS15dot (57386.30) : type II at z=0.149 (host galaxy redshift). The
epoch is uncertain, but likely to be 10 to 20days after explosion.
This is a bright type II at M_i ~ -18.5, but likely to have exploded 10
days before the GW detection.

PS15dov (57386.32) : type II in UGC2836 (z=0.016702 host redshift). Fairly old
and reddened type II, with prominent P-Cygni lines of H-alpha and
Ca II. Likely more than 50 days old. Only 4-5 arcsec separation
from the recorded coordinates (NED and CBET) for SN203ih and SN2001I.
Exploded long before the GW trigger.

PS15dpb (57386.43) :  type II in UGC2828 (z=0.041045 host redshift).Fairly old
type II, around 20-30 days after explosion. Therefore, a likely
explosion epoch around 15-25d before G211117.
