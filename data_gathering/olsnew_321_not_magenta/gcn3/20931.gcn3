We observed 52 galaxies from the GLADE catalog (weighted by the B-band 
luminosities) and 8 galaxies from the CLU catalog (stellar mass-weighted 
from Cook et al., LVC GCN 20800) within the BAYESTAR error region for 
the neutron star merger candidate G275697 (Siellez et al. LVC GCN 
20763). A plot of the galaxy selection function and the list of targeted 
galaxies can be found here:

The observations, designed to detect a possible orphan afterglow, were 
carried out with the AMI Large Array (AMI-LA) at 15 GHz over two epochs 
within 15 days post-trigger. The median 4sigma detection threshold in 
each epoch is 200 uJy at the pointing center (400 uJy at the half power 
radius of the beam, 3 arcmin). We manually inspected all the sources 
detected above 4sigma within approximately 4 arcmin (= 230 kpc 
separation at 200 Mpc) of the AMI-LA beam, amounting to a total search 
area of 0.8 sq. deg and a containment volume probability of 1.3%.

We have devised a ranking scheme (rank 1-4; with 1 being the most likely 
to be associated with the GW event and 4 being the least likely) for 
transient candidates similar to that of Swift. A detailed description of 
the ranking scheme can be found in the URL mentioned above. Among the 
~70 unique point sources detected in the AMI-LA observations, we found 
two candidates which warrant further follow up. The candidates are 
detailed below. All quoted upper limits are 3sigma. We note that the 
observations for a third epoch with the AMI-LA are ongoing, and further 
information on these and other candidates will be reported in subsequent 
GCNs.

Rank 2:
======
1) AMILA J220556+503620
March 02.38 (UT): <312 uJy
March 09.36 (UT): 620+/-75 uJy
Comments: All sources in the field are ~10% smaller than the synthesized 
beam. Nearby source is stable.

Rank 3:
======
1) AMILA J213542+394253
March 03.59 (UT): 1257+/-78 uJy
March 10.57 (UT): 1621+/-83 uJy
Comments: Variable (>3sigma). No nearby source for flux density comparison.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
