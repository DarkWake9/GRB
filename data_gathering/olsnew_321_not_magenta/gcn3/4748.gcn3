Using the data set from T-299.8 to T+302.2 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060210
(trigger #180977)  (Beardmore, et al., GCN 4724; Parsons, et al., GCN 4734).  
The BAT ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) 
= 57.729, 27.024  deg {3h 50m 55.1s, 27d 1' 27.5"} (J2000)
+- 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 41%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows many peaks with significant emission
peaks starting at T-230 sec and the last peak at T+200.  We caution that
this on-going activity is a significant fraction of the t-300 to T+300 sec
data interval we have received so far.  This burst may have earlier or 
later activity. The main activity is from T-75 to T+20 sec with the 
brightest peak at T_zero.
T90 (15-350 keV) is (255 +- 10) sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-227.5 to T+205.8 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.52 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 
(7.7 +- 0.4) x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
from T+0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band is (2.8 +- 0.3) ph/cm2/sec.  
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
