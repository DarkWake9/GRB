SUBJECT: GRB 200630B: Fermi GBM Final Localization
DATE:    20/07/01 01:03:56 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

At 23:31:21.89 UT on 30 June 2002, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200630B (trigger 615252686 / 200630980).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 79.3, Dec = +31.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 79h 16m, 30d 59m'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66 degrees.
