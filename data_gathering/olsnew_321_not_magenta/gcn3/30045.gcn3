The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:04:09 UT on 18 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210518A (trigger 643035854.639946 / 210518545).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 270.0, Dec = 49.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 00m, 49d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 142.0 degrees.
