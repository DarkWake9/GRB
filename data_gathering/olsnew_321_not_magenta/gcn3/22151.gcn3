TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  22151
SUBJECT: GRB 171123A: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have now received the full dataset from the early Swift-XRT
observations of GRB 171123A (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 22148). In these
data, the afterglow is clearly detected, and the light curve shows an
initial decay and plateau, typical of GRB afterglows. The best position
currently available was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 22150). This
position is ~15 arcsec from that reported in GCN 22148. This is because 
the object lay ~14 arcsec outside the field of view of the 
promptly-available XRT data, so only the edges of the PSF were available for
source localisation.

As ever, the automated XRT analysis can be viewed at

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
