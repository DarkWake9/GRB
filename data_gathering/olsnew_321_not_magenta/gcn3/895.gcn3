K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, F. Frontera, C. Guidorzi, and E.
Montanari, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, and E. Mazets and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses and NEAR have only recently emerged from an intense solar
proton event lasting approximately two weeks.  Ulysses, NEAR, BeppoSAX
GRBM, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 28869 seconds.  Its spectrum
and duration place it firmly in the "short/hard" class of gamma-ray
bursts.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of 
<0.5 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.7E-7 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  6.8E-7 erg/cm2 s over 0.5 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with approximate area  18 square arcminutes, whose coordinates are:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   2 h 41 m  8.59 s     12 o 53 '  46.31 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  2 h 41 m 10.35 s     12 o 51 '  56.95 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  2 h 40 m 50.39 s     12 o 51 '  35.60 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  2 h 41 m 26.79 s     12 o 55 '  57.13 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  2 h 41 m  6.83 s     12 o 55 '  35.67 " 

Because solar protons were still being recorded by Ulysses,
this burst was detected at slightly under 5 sigma significance
(statistical only), making it somewhat marginal.  However,
final consistency checks are now being carried out, and the
results will be communicated as soon as they are available.
