A. Pozanenko (IKI), R. Inasaridze (AAO), E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), 
Molotov (KIAM), report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 150213B (Pagani et al., GCN 17464) 
with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory.   We obtained several 
unfiltered images starting on Feb. 13 (UT) 23:24:58 and ending Feb. 14 (UT) 
01:06:30. In the first single images of 120 s exposure we clearly detect 
the optical afterglow (Pagani et al., GCN 17464; Kann et al., GCN 17465; 
Malesani et al., GCN 17467).   Preliminary photometry of the afterglow is 
19.7m (at  54 minutes after burst trigger) in comparison with nearby 
USNO-B1.0 stars (R2 mags).

Data receiving and reduction is ongoing.
