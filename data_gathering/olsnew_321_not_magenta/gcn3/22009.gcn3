and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 171010B (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 21995),
collecting 4.8 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+91.1 ks
and T0+120.1 ks. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected consistent with being
within 96 arcsec of the Swift/BAT position, however it is not above the
RASS limit and does not show definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at
the present time we cannot confirm if it is the afterglow. Details of
the source are given below:

Source 2:
  RA (J2000.0):  34.1342  =  02:16:32.20
  Dec (J2000.0): -54.3915  =  -54:23:29.2
  Error: 5.6 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (6.9 [+1.5, -1.4])e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 71 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (3.35 [+0.74, -0.68])e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)


Six uncatalogued sources were also detected too far from the GRB
position to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
