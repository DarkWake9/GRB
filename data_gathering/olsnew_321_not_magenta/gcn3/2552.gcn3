A short hard GRB 040322 was detected by Konus-Wind at 07:29:05.811 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 07:29:03.437 UT.
It had a duration of approximately 0.19 s.


We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 277.891 deg,
Decl(2000) = -22.877 deg,
Radius = 39.71  +/- 1.16 degrees (3 sigma ).

In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response limits the
arrival directions to a band between ecliptic
latitudes -15 and +5 degrees.
