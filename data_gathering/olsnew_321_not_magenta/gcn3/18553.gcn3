I.A. Steele, C.M. Copperwheat, A.S. Piascik (Liverpool JMU) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

A spectrum of the iPTF candidate iPTYF-15dmk (GCN 18497) was obtained with the
SPRAT spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope on 2015-11-02 at 23:37UT.  The
wavelength range is 4000-8000 Angstroms and the spectral resolution R=350.

Classification using SNID indicates the transient is a Type II supernova with
redshift z=0.065 and near maximum light.
