report on behalf the Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed the first orbit data (632 s exposure) of the
Swift ToO observation of the INTEGRAL detected burst GRB 081204
(Gotz, GCN Circ. #8614).
The Swift observation started on 2008 Dec 04 at 19:29 UT,
about 2h 45m after the INTEGRAL trigger.
We detected a single X-ray source within the INTEGRAL error box at
RA, Dec =349.7873, -60.2253 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  23 19 08.96
Dec (J2000): -60 13 31.3

with an uncertainty of 7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
The source lies 29 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position and has
a count rate of ~2.0E-02 counts/s with a 2.6 sigma significance.
At the moment it is not possible to determine whether it is fading,
but the Swift observation is still on going and we are waiting for
more data.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
