P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii), T. Minezaki (IoA, Tokyo), L.L. Cowie, Y.
Kakazu (IfA, Hawaii) and Y. Yoshii (IoA, Tokyo) report:

We observed the XRT position (GCN 4850) of GRB 060306 (GCN 4848) with
the robotic MAGNUM telescope + MIP dual-beam camera beginning at Mar
6.235 UTC (4.8 hours after the GRB).  Images in the R, I and J bands
show a source present within the XRT error circle, with R ~ 20.7 mag
(based on USNO-A2.0 star at 02:44:19.08 -02:08:53.6 with R = 15.2 mag). 
However, this source is also present in the Digitised Sky Survey red
plate at a similar flux level.  The position of the source from the DSS
plate is:

	02:44:22.98 -02:08:51.1 J2000

Due to the limited time baseline, we cannot make a meaningful test for
variability, and hence it is not yet clear whether or not this source is
related to the GRB.  If related, it would likely indicate that the GRB
is at a relatively low redshift.  No other sources are identified within
the XRT error circle to R ~ 22 mag.

Observers with CCD images of the source at a different epoch are invited
to contact PAP to perform image subtraction.
