D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley), P. Nugent (LBL), and J. S. Bloom (UCB) report:

We have created a stacked image through the co-addition of 8
unfiltered images taken by the NEAT collaboration and 13 images in
the RG610 filter taken by the Palomar-Quest Consortium at the Palomar
Oschin Schmidt telescope (obtained from 2002-2006) of GRB 070809 
(Marshall et al., GCN 6728), possibly a short-hard burst.

No object is detected within the XRT error circle (GCN 6728) to a 
limiting magnitude (3-sigma) of R~22.3.
