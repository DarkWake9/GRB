M. Nysewander, J. Haislip report on behalf of the UNC GRB Team:

PROMPT began observing the position of the XRT error circle (Ziaeepour et
al., GCN 5233) 44 seconds after the GRB trigger, 25 seconds after the
initial alert in Ugriz.

We confirm the presence of the bright, fading optical afterglow: in our
initial r' image, we find the source to be r' ~ 16.3 at a mean time of 65
seconds after the burst. It then brightened to r' ~ 16 at 90-s, and by
140-s it had risen to a magnitude of r' ~ 14.5.
