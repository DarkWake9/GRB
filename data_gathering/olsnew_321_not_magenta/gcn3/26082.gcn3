The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:10:01 UT on 28 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191028A (trigger 593928606.398038 / 191028174).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 319.2, Dec = -11.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 16m, -11d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 89.0 degrees.
