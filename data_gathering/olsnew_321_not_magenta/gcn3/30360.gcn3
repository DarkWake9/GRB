I.A. Smith (Rice U.), D.A. Perley (LJMU), and N.R. Tanvir 
(U. of Leicester) report:

We observed the Swift UVOT location of GRB 210610B (Page 
et al., GCN Circ. 30170) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter 
continuum camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  
Observations totaling 3.1 hours were obtained on UT 2021-06-11, 
2021-06-12, and 2021-06-13 in good weather conditions each day.
No counterpart was detected in the individual or combined maps.
Combining all the data, the RMS background noise was 0.94 mJy/beam 
at 850 microns and 5.7 mJy/beam at 450 microns; the mid-point of 
the run was 1.61 days after the burst trigger.  

We thank Patrice Smith, Alexis-Ann Acohido, Harriet Parsons,
Mark Rawlings, and the JCMT staff for the prompt support of these 
observations that were taken under project M21AP020.
