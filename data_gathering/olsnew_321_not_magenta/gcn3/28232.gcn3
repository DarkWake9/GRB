The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:04:31 UT on 9 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200809A (trigger 618642276.564984 / 200809211).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 205.1, Dec = -26.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 40m, -26d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
