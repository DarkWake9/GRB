FROM:    Mike Siegel at PSU/Swift MOC  <mhs18@psu.edu>

M. H. Siegel (PSU) and S. J. LaPorte (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team.

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 859 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
 RA(J2000)  =	04:22:10.57 =  65.54403
 DEC(J2000) = +02:11:29.3  =	2.19146
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.79 arc sec. This position is 1.7
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
19.52 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.17. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.22.
