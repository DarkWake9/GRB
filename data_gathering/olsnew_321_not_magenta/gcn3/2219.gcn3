report:

We have observed the OT GRB030329 found by B.Peterson and P.Price (GCN 1985)
with 1.5m telescope of Mt.Maidanak High-altitude Observatory  (UBAI).
Several BVRI Bessel images were obtained on May 3, and 5 under good
photometric and seeing conditions  (1-1.5 arcsec).   Based on filed
photometry  by A. Henden (GCN 2082) we estimate the OT magnitudes:
