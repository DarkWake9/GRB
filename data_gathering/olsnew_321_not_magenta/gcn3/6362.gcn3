 Using the data set from T-239.0 to T+963.1 sec from the recent telemetry
 downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070429
 (trigger #277571)  (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 6355).  The BAT
 ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 297.695, -32.420 deg which is
    RA(J2000) = 19h 50m 46.9s
    Dec(J2000) = -32d 25' 12.1"
 with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). 
 The partial coding was 68%.
  
 The masked weighted light curve shows a single somewhat broad peak,
 extending out to T+50 sec, followed by several smaller peaks.
 T90 (15-350 keV) is 163 +- 5sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
 The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.4 to T+178.0 is best fit by
 a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
 spectrum is 2.11 +- 0.27. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
 9.2 +- 1.4 x 10-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
 from T+3.99 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec. 
 All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
