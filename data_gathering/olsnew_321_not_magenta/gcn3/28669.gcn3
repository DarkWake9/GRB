V. D'Elia (SSDC) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 13:13:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201017B (trigger=1000631).  Swift did not slew to the source. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 170.233, -60.614 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 11h 20m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = -60d 36' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure.  The peak count rate was ~1265 counts/sec (15-350 keV), 
at ~6 sec after the trigger.
