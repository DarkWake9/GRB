The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160624A (D'Ai et al., GCN 19560) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jun 24.97, Jun 29.18, and 
Jul 02.05 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 19566), with 3sigma upper limits of 268 uJy, 93 
uJy, and 114 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
