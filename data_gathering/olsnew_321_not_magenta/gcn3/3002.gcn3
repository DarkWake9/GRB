Swift-BAT triggered on an outburst from SGR1806-20 at 22:38:26.86 UT 30 Jan 05.
This is a large normal burst from this source.  The peak rate is 340,000 cnts/sec
(1-sec average).  There was a single spike with a 0.4-sec rise, a 4.2-sec decay,
with additional emission extending out to ~T+15 sec.  On top of this tail,
there are five spikes at T+7, T+17, T+32, T+85, and T+118sec.
The fluence is ~1x10e-5 erg/cm2 (15-350 keV).  We note that this is
five orders of magnitude smaller than the giant flare from this source
on 27 Dec 04.  Also note that there was a burst from this source
earlier today at 20:45:26 UT with a peak rate of ~4000 cnts/sec
(0.128-sec average) and a duration of ~0.5 sec.
