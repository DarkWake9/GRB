J. P. Halpern & E. Armstrong (Columbia U.) report on behalf
of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We observed the afterglow of INTEGRAL GRB 070311 in the
R band on the fourth and fifth consecutive nights using
the MDM 1.3m telescope.  The new results are summarized
as follows (using the comparison star from GCN 6195):

       -----------------------------------------
       Date(UT)  t-t0(days) Exposure R(mag) +/-
       -----------------------------------------
       Mar 14.15    3.07     7x600s  22.65  0.07
       Mar 15.14    4.06     9x600s  23.62  0.13
       -----------------------------------------

These magnitudes are in agreement with observations of
Greco et al. (GCN 6204) and Kann, Filgas, & Hoegner
GCN (6206), which together show that the rebrightening
we reported in GCN 6203 peaked on day 2.  The afterglow
is now fading rapidly.
