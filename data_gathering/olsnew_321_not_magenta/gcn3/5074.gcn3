E.J.A. Meurs, S.D. Vergani, C. O'Maoileidigh (Dunsink Observatory), D. 
Malesani (SISSA), and R. Gualandi (Loiano Observatory), report:

We observed the field of the short GRB 060502B (Troja et al. 2006, GCN 
5055) with the 152 Cassini telescope located in Loiano, Italy, equipped 
with BFOSC. Observations were conducted under moderate weather 
conditions (passing cirrus), securing three 20-min exposures. The mean 
time was May 2.96198 UT (5.68 hr after the burst). The average seeing 
was 1.8". No source was detected inside the revised XRT error circle 
(Troja et al. 2006, GCN 5063) in the coadded frame. The limiting 
magnitude is R = 20.6 (3 sigma) based on the USNO catalog.
