teams,

I. Mitrofanov, S. Charyshnikov, V. Grinkov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, and
A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this
burst at 15952 s.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 15 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
7.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  8.0E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary, 3 sigma error
boxes each with approximate area 1900 square arcminutes whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)

 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  6 h 55 m 15.97 s    -14 o 26 '  59.30 " 

                                       OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  15 h 21 m 57.47 s     26 o 26 '  32.98 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 15 h 24 m 16.10 s     27 o 48 '  30.52 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 15 h 27 m  8.20 s     29 o 45 '  26.15 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 15 h 16 m 37.66 s     23 o  7 '  27.46 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 15 h 19 m 37.52 s     25 o  4 '  34.99 " 

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further processing.
These error boxes may be improved.
