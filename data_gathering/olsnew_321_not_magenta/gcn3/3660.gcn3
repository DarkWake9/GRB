S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

In GCN 3474 we reported wrong value of the Konus-Wind fluence
for GRB 050525A (because of missprinting).
The correct value is (2.06 +/- 0.02)10-5 erg/cm2 .
The reported peak flux and spectral parameters were correct.

We thank Dr. Hurley for noticing this error.
