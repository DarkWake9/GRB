Dale A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed both recent bursts, GRB 051117A (GCN 4280) and GRB
051117B (GCN 4281) with the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz centered on
November 18.51 UT and 18.48, respectively. Within the XRT error
circles (GCN 4282; GCN 4287) we no radio emission above 3-sigma, for
an rms noise of 56 uJy (GRB 051117A), and 40 uJy (GRB 051117B).

No further observations are planned.
