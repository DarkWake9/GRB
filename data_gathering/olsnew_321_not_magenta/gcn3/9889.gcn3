SUBJECT: GRB 090902B: VLA radio detection
DATE:    09/09/04 13:23:07 GMT
FROM:    Poonam Chandra at U Virginia/NRAO  <pc8s@virginia.edu>

Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the field of view towards
the GRB 090902B (GCN 9866) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Sep.
03.94 UT. We clearly detect the GRB afterglow at the GROND NIR afterglow
position (GCN 9874) at a flux density of 141+/-39 uJy.

Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
