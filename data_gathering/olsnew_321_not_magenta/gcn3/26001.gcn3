We observed the field of GRB 191011A (Laha et al., GCN Circ. 25988) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m
Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2019/10 11.26 to 2019/10 11.48 UTC (1.60 to 6.94 hours after
the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.64 hours exposure in the i band and
0.49 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the USNO-B1
and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections and upper limits
(3-sigma):

  i	= 21.59 +/- 0.13
  Z	= 21.22 +/- 0.21
  Y	> 21.76
  J	> 19.81
  H	> 20.54

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
