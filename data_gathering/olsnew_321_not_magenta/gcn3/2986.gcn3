2,8 hours after  SWIFT alert  (GCN 2984)  MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had  imaging  the
corresponding area of the sky  under the bad weather conditions on the
evening sky.  We have
about 15  unfiltered images of the error box (45s exposition, 6 square
degrees
field) started at 26 Jan 2005	14:49:18 UT (2,8 hours after  GRB time).

The better limiting magnitude on the  images was about 15.5 (close to
R-band).
There is no  OT within  the 1' SWIFT error circle on 3 sigma level.
On the some of the images (around 15h 18m UT) we see (in the 1' SWIFT
error circle) very close
to noise one object
with coordinates

18 32 28.5
+42 21 47
(error = +-4'')

The optical limit on summ - 16.5.
JPG-images  are available at
