S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-
Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050502a (GCN 3323) with the automated
Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  Observations consisted of 30 x 120 s
exposures in the Kron R band, taken at a mean epoch of 9:30 May 3 UT (~
30.3 hours after the burst).  We detect no emission at the location of
the afterglow reported by Yost et. al. (GCN 3322).  Our limiting
magnitude, estimated by comparison with several Guide Star Catalog
sources in the field, is approximately R > 21.5.
