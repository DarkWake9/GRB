 report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team:

"We have observed the position of GRB 050408 afterglow reported by 
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN #3192) in z'-band with SuprimeCam on the
Subaru 8.2m telescope atop Mauna Kea on Apr. 09 and 10, approximately
13.3 and 37.3 hours after the burst event, respectively.  The seeing
condition was around 0.6 arcsec for the both nights.  We measured the
afterglow brightness to be z'(Vega) = 21.2 +/- 0.2 and 22.0 +/- 0.2,
and the temporal index to be -0.7.  

Although these magnitudes are inconsistent with the magnitude of the
host galaxy candidate proposed by Lamb et al. (z = 21.39 mag; GCN #3212),
the position of the proposed host coincides with a field galaxy
(z'(AB)= 21.34 mag in our measurement) located 8 arcsec South-West to
the afterglow."
