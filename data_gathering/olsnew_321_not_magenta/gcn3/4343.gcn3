TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4343
SUBJECT: GRB051211B, RBO optical observations
DATE:    05/12/12 22:27:58 GMT
FROM:    Chris Rodgers at U of Wyoming  <crodgers@uwyo.edu>

D. Allen, C. Rodgers, R. Canterna (University of Wyoming) report on behalf
of the Red Buttes Observatory (0.6m) GRB Team as part of the FUN GRB
Collaboration.

We responded to GRB 051211B (INTEGRAL trig. 2712; Mereghetti et al,
GCN4327) at 2005/12/12 00:59:37 UT with two 10 minute I and R exposures
centered on the position of the original INTEFRAL GRB Position under 4.6
arcsecond photometric conditions.  The source was not detected in any of
the above exposures in the same position reported by Klotz et al. (GCN
4328) due to detection limits.
