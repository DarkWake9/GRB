We observed the 90% containment region of the Bayestar map (Singer et
al. LVC GCN 21513) with 7 antennas of the The Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We recorded fast autocorrelation
data with 336 x 1 MHz channels and a time sampling of 1.26 ms centered
at 1320 MHz (see [1] for observing details). We used flys-eye
observing mode, with some parts of the field covered by 2 antennas and
some by 1 antenna.

We had 3 observing runs with start times (UTC) and durations as shown below:

2017-08-18 04:05 3.6 hrs
2017-08-18 08:57 4.1 hrs
2017-08-19 02:08 11.0 hrs

We searched out to a dispersion measure of 2000 pc/cm3 and width
boxcar widths from 1 to 32 samples.

We found no fast radio bursts above a threshold of approximately 40 Jy/sqrt(ms).

We thank the CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
