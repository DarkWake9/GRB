The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:47:00 UT on 13 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190613B (trigger 582115625.049376 / 190613449).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 305.4, Dec = -11.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 21m, -11d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
