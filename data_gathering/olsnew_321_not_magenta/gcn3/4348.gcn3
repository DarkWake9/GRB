Using the data set from T-75 to T+300 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report on further analysis of GRB 051213
(trigger #172516)  (Mineo, et al., GCN 4345). The BAT
ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 252.078, -59.229
{16h 48m 18.6s, -59d 13' 42.7"} [deg; J2000] +-1.8 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 68%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure, with each
episode lasting ~30 seconds and showing a roughly time-symmetrical structure.
The first episode peaks at T-7 sec, and the second at T+49 sec and emission
returns to background levels between the two episodes.   T90 (15-350 keV)
is (70 +- 5) sec (estimated error including systematics).

The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.64 +- 0.20.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (8.0 +- 1.0) x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+48.9 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is (0.51 +- 0.14) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.

We are classifying this event as GRB, but given the soft spectrum and
long duration, we can not rule out that it is a hard x-ray transient.
