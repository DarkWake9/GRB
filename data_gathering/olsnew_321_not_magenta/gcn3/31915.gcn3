The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 17:16:21 UT on 18 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220418B (trigger 671994986.650868 / 220418720).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 216.5, Dec = -26.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 26m, -26d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 29.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.
