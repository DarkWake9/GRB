We observed GRB 201006A reported by Swift-BAT (J.D. Gropp et al., GCN
28560; also see: S.Mereghetti et al., GCN 28561; M.R. Goad et al., GCN
28562; Aaron Tohuvavohu GCN 28563; R. Hamburg and C. Meegan, GCN 28564; F.
E. Marshall and J. D. Gropp GCN 28565; S. D. Barthelmy et al., GCN 28567;
J. D. Gropp et al., GCN 28568; N. Ito et al., 28571, S.Dichiara et al., GCN
28572) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). The field was observed in
the SDSS râ€™ filter starting at 2020-10-06T18:32:40.4 UT i.e. ~17.25 hrs
after the event detection by Swift-BAT. We obtained 20 exposures of 300 sec
each. The field was close to the moon (~43 deg) during observations. We did
not find any source in the stacked image within the uncertainty region of
2.1 arcsec around the Swift-XRT position of RA(J2000): 04h 07m 34.25s,
Dec(J2000): +65d 09' 52.6" (GCN  28562). We obtained an upper limit of r >
20.09 mag, calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data release (Flewelling et
al., 2018).

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
