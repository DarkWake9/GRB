 At 14:20:15 UT Swift-BAT triggered on burst GRB 050401 (trigger=113120).
 The BAT-derived position is RA,Dec=247.880,+2.184 (J2000).  We note this
 is 42 arcsec from the XRT Position GCN Notice.  The lightcurve
 shows 5 main peaks with a total burst duration of 38 sec.  The first peak
 started about 9 sec before the trigger, and the fifth peak started
 at T+23 sec.  The peak count rate was 5000 cnts/sec.  This burst
 was 56 deg of the BAT bore sight (<10% coding).  We note that
 the Swift Star Trackers were locked at the time of the trigger and
 all initial inspections indicate that the attitude solution for the s/c
 is normal (unlike yesterday's episode).
