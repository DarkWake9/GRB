SUBJECT: GRB 090704: a long GRB found in INTEGRAL off-line analysis

S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), C. Ferrigno, M. 
Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

During an off-line analysis of low significance IBAS triggers we found a 
long GRB detected in IBIS/ISGRI data at 05:47:43 UT on July 4th.  The 
burst had a duration of about 60 s.

The burst coordinates (J2000)  are:

 RA:    208.205 [degrees]
 DEC:    22.790 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin (1 sigma c.l.).

The peak flux in the 20-200 keV range was about 2 ph/cmq/s (1 s 
integration time) and the fluence over the same energy range about 6e-6 
erg/cmq.

The low significance of the IBAS trigger, below the threshold for 
automatic alert delivery, was due to the very large off-axis angle of 
about 14 degrees.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
