SUBJECT: Cancellation of IBAS/INTEGRAL GRB alerts
DATE:    04/07/18 22:12:22 GMT
FROM:    INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>

The Gamma Ray burst alerts issued by IBAS on 18-07-2004 between the
hours of 20:43 and 21:19 UTC,

namely, IBAS alert numbers: 1846 - 1853,

are not real GRBs and are due to temporary problems with the satellite's
star tracker affecting attitude information.

IBAS alert issuing has been disabled until the above problems are
solved, and will likely be restarted during the morning of 19-07-2004.
