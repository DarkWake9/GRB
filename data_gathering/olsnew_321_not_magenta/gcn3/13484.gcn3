N. P. M. Kuin (MSSL-UCL), F. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), and C. J. Saxton (UCL-MSSL)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 120714B
129 s after the BAT trigger (Saxton et al., GCN Circ. 13471).
The UVOT source candidate reported by Marshall and Saxton
(GCN Circ. No.  13473) is found to decay.

The preliminary UVOT position is RA, Dec (J2000) = (355.40864,-46.18387),
or in sexagesimal coordinates:

RA = 23h41m38.1s
Dec = -46d11'02"

with 90% confidence error radius of 0.58".

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT
photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)           Mag

white              129          165           35         18.40 +/- 0.20
white            10034        10184          147        >20.8
b                10195        11102          885        >21.5

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.01 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
