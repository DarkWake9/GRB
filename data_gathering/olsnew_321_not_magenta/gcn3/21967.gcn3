A. Cucchiara (U. Virgin Islands) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"On July 10.05 UT  (T_0 +30 min) we began observing the
center of the field of GRB 170710A (Evans et al.
GCN 21308, Osborne et al. GCN 21310) using the Las Cumbres
Observatory 1m telescope located in Cerro Tololo.

We performed a series of 10x60s observations in SDSS I band
for a total of 10 minutes on sky.

In the full median stacked images we identified no optical
counterpart at the location of the optical counterpart
(Cucchiara et al. GCN 21311, Breeveld et al. GCN 21315).

Nevertheless, at the OT location we identified a
2-sigma excess corresponding to I=21.28 +- 0.24 mag, consistent
with other observations at similar time post-burst.

These magnitudes are calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 sources,
and not corrected for Galactic extinction."
