Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161218A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 727288) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 49 min after the GRB trigger
at the end of the night. The elevation of the field
increased from 3 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures.
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+49 min to t0+68 min : Rlim = 17.3

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
