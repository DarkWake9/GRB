P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) and M. Perri (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift 
UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT observed the field of GRB 071112B (Perri et al., GCN 7058) 
62 minutes after the BAT trigger, once the Earth had come out of observing 
constraint. No new source is found in any of the UVOT observations in 
either single or co-added exposures within the refined BAT error circle 
(Fenimore et al., GCN 7071) or anywhere within the UVOT field of view down 
to the following 5-sigma upper limits:

Filter  Tmid    Exp     Magnitude
         (s)     (s)    (5-sigma UL)
White   8864    885      > 20.7
v       3826    197      > 18.2
b       8306    197      > 19.5
u       6905    290      > 19.1
uvw1    4236    197      > 18.8
uvm2    4031    197      > 18.7
uvw2    9419    187      > 18.9

where Tmid is the weighted mean of the co-added exposures. The values 
quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic extinction 
corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.12 mag in the direction of the 
GRB (Schlegel et al. 1998).
