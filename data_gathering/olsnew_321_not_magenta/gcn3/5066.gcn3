FROM:    Jules Halpern at Columbia U.  <jules@astro.columbia.edu>

J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) and N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) report:

"We observed the location of Swift short GRB 060502B (Troja et al., GCN 5055) 
in the R band on the MDM 1.3m telescope starting on May 03 08:22 UT, 
15 hours after the trigger.  A summed 45 minute exposure has a limiting 
magnitude of R~23.5.  To this limit, there is a single object in the refined 
XRT error circle of Troja et al. (GCN 5063), at coordinates

   (J2000) 18h 35m 45.89s +52d 37' 56.2" (+/- 1")

Its magnitude is R = 21.6 +/- 0.1, calibrated with Landolt standard stars,
and it appears unresolved in seeing of 1.7".  Further optical observations 
are encouraged.
