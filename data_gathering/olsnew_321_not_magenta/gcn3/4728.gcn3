G. G. Williams (MMTO) and P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory), on behalf of 
the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box of 
GRB060210 (Swift Trigger 180977, GCN 4724) at 04:59:44.9 UT, 55 seconds 
after the burst.  Our initial observations include 5 x 10s exposures, 5 x 
20s exposures, and 30 x 60s exposures, all in the R-band.  We do not 
detect the afterglow reported by Fox et al. (GCN 4723) and Li et al. (GCN 
4725) in our earliest exposure to the following 5-sigma limiting magnitude 
using USNO-B1 stars:

t obs (UT)	exp t (s)	t-t_0 (s)	Limit
--------------------------------------------------------
04:59:44.9	10 		55.1 		R > 17.5

Additional multi-band observations and analysis including image stacking 
are ongoing.
