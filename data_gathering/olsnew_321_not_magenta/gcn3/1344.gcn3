  We have observed covering the entire error circle of GRB020331
 (Ricker et al. GCN 1315) field with the RIMOTS 30-cm telescope.  The
 observations started at an early epoch (+1.6 hours after the burst).
 All the images were taken with 15 sec exposure and stacked for deeper
 inspection.
 
  From a comparison with the DSS-2 images we did not identify any new
 point source for the GRB.  We summarize the observing time and the
 R-band limiting magnitude (SN=3), which was estimated by the
 comparison of our non-filter data with the R band field photometry by
 Henden (GCN 1319).
