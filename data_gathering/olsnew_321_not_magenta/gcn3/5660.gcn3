Using the data set from T-240 to T+321 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060929 (trigger #231702)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 5654).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 263.158, 29.846 deg {17h 32m 37.9s, 29d 50' 44.3"} (J2000)
+- 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 84%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a roughly triangular shaped peak
starting at T-5 sec, peaking at T+3 sec, and ending at T+9 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 12.4 +- 0.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.5 to T+9.0 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.50 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.69 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
