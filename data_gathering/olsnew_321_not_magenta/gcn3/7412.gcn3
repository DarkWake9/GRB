"We have monitored the optical afterglow of GRB080310 (Cummings et al
GCN 7382) on the night of March 10th using the Mt. Lemmon 1m and the
Lulin 1m telescopes. These time coverage are 09:26 -- 12:54 UT
(Mt. Lemmon) and 15:52--21:16 UT (Lulin), respectively. All of images
taken with 300 sec exposure in V and R band show the afterglow clearly.

Based on our preliminary results calibrated using USNO-B1.0 catalog,
we confirmed the decaying light curve with a power-law index 0.7+/0.1
between 0.8 and 2.1 hours after the burst. This result is consistent
with the observations by the LBT (Garnavich et al., GCN 7390) and the
ROTSE-III (Yuan et al., GCN 7411).  The light curve between 7.3 and
12.2 hrs after the burst is well described by single power-law with
index 0.8+/-0.1 in R-band. The extrapolation of this power-law is also
consistent with the observation by the LBT (Garnavich et al. 7409).
We could not confirm the plateau phase reported by the MITSuME (Yoshida
et al., GCN 7410)."
