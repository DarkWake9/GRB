The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160504A (Malesani et al., GCN 19382) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 May 04.85, May 05.88, May 
07.82, May 11.90, and May 14.90 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Goad et al., GCN 19386), with 3sigma upper limits of 
93 uJy, 72 uJy, 129 uJy, 123 uJy, and 120 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
