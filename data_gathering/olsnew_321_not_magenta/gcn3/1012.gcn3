Optical Observations of GRB 010324

J. S. Bloom, D. W. Fox (CIT), J. M. Schombert (U. Oregon), S. G.
Djorgovski, A. Mahabal, D. E. Reichart, and P. A. Price (CIT) report on
behalf of the larger Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB Collaboration:

"On 25.27 March 2001 UT, James Schombert observed the field of GRB 010324
(GCN/RXTE ASM; Hurley et al., GCN #1011) using COSMIC on the Palomar
200-inch atop Mt. Palomar.  The entire XTE error box was observed in
V-band in two pointings with a total of 1800 sec per pointing.  We found
no new candidate source when compared visually with the J, F, N-plates of
DPOSS-II. Further optical monitoring is encouraged."

Original DPOSS images of the field are available at:

We thank Rick Burruss at Palomar for his assistance.
