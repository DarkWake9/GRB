and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 190813A (The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 25317)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 587392154) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), at about 44950 s UT (12:29:10).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=96.795 deg (06h 27m 11s) Dec(2000)=-39.989 deg (-39d 59' 21"),
whose radius is 23.630 +/- 8.231 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the 
Fermi-GBM one.

This annulus may be improved.
