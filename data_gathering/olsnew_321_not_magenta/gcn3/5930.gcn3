Using the a limited data set from T-10 to T+57 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061217 (trigger #251634)
(Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 5926).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 160.418, -21.148 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 41m 40.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -21d 08' 52.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 85%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve consists of a single spike (at 64-sec binning).
We note that will only this limited amount of data n the first downlink
we can not say anthing about activity before T-10 sec or after T+57 sec.
When more data has been downlinked, we will issue another Circular.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.30 +- 0.05 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+0.3 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.96 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.6 +- 0.8 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.40 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
