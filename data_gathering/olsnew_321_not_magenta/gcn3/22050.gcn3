and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171013B (Fermi-GBM trigger #529575887) triggered the
CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 08:24:45.797 on 13 October 2017.
The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T0 sec,
peaks at T+17 sec and ends at T+26 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the
SGM data is 18.9 +- 1.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
