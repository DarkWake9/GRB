We imaged the field of GRB 130131B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 547420) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 1.2h after the GRB trigger
because the GRB occured when the field of view was
under the local horizon. At the start of the observations,
the elevation of the field increased from 10 degrees
above horizon and gibbous moon was at 25 degrees away
from the GRB position.

We co-added a series of exposures. No optical transcient
was detected at the XRT position (Siegel et al. GCNC 14159)
with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+1.3h - 2.2h : R > 17.1

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
