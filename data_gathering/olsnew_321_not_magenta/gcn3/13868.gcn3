TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13868
SUBJECT: GRB 121011A: WSRT radio observation
DATE:    12/10/14 20:51:12 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 121011A afterglow at 4.9 GHz
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at October 14 10.01
to 18.14 UT, i.e. 2.95 - 3.29 days after the burst (GCN 13845).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical
counterpart (GCN 13853). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around
that position is 75 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for
a point source at the position of the optical counterpart is 44 +/- 25 
microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
