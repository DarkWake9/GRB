report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 090530A
(Swift trigger 353567). The first image was at 03:18:35.8 UT, 17.4 s after
the burst (6.8 s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images are
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a new object, not visible in the
DSS (second epoch), with coordinates:

     11:57:40.5      +26:35:37.9    (J2000), with positional uncertainty of
1" or better

marked 48 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
