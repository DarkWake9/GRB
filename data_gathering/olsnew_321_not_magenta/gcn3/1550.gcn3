K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, Konus, and Mars Odyssey GRB teams, 

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, 
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Konus, GRS, and HEND observed this burst at 47182 s.  We have triangulated
it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)=167.356, +6.634 degrees,
whose radius is 57.136 +/- 0.054 degrees.  

Ulysses data are expected to arrive by 2400 UT September 24.  If this
event was indeed detected by Ulysses, it should be possible to derive
an error box for it.  More details will be given in a later message.
