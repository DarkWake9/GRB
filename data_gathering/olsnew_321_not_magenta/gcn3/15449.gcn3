Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 131105A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 576738) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 231s after the GRB trigger
(14s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
37 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

A first series of 30.0s exposure images was acquired in tracking mode.
We do not detect the afterglow candidate of Xu et al. (GCNC 15447)
with limiting magnitudes of:
t0+231s to t0+261s : Rlim = 18.3
t0+311s to t0+341s : Rlim = 18.3
t0+351s to t0+381s : Rlim = 18.3
t0+391s to t0+421s : Rlim = 18.3
t0+432s to t0+462s : Rlim = 18.3

Next series were co added by drizzling to increase the detectivity.
t0+ 472s to t0+1131s : Rlim = 19.0
t0+1141s to t0+1658s : Rlim = 19.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
