S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) and
A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 08:15:34 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR1806-20 (trigger=866993).  Swift did not slew to the source
because of an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 272.166, -20.380, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 08m 40s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 22' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 3 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 2018 October 16. No XRT or UVOT follow-ups are planned.
