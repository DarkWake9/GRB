TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1396
SUBJECT: IPN detection of possible bursts from SGR1806-20

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB
team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus teams, report:

Two short bursts were detected on May 25 which, due to their proximity
in time to an earlier burst from SGR1806-20 (see GCN 1391), may also be
from this SGR.  The first was at ~16014 s and was observed by Konus-Wind;
the second was detected by Ulysses and was at 43615 s (Ulysses time;
the spacecraft was ~1850 light-seconds from Earth).  If the second
event came from SGR1806-20, its Earth-crossing time would have been
~1047 s earlier, or ~42568 s.
