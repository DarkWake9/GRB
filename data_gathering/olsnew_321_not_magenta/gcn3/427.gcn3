Rome, report: "GRB 991014 was observed with the Narrow Field Instruments 
(NFI) on board BeppoSAX from Oct. 15.4 to 16.4 UT (starting 13.0 hrs 
after the burst trigger time). In the 2-10 keV image of all data from both
Medium-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer units 2 and 3, two point sources are 
apparent within the WFC/IPN combined error box (Tassone et al., IAUC 7281, 
Hurley et al. GCN 419). Their positions are R.A. = 6h51m03s, 
Decl. = +11d36'05" (S1) and R.A. = 6h50m59s, Decl. = +11d33'09" (S2, 
Eq. 2000.0). The error radius for both sources is 1'.5. Neither S1 nor S2 show 
conclusive evidence of decay, but this is a statistical issue rather than a 
meaningful statement about the decay index. To search for a decay and 
possibly identify the afterglow with S1 or S2, another NFI pointing is 
scheduled for Oct. 24.
