N.P.M. Kuin (MSSL/UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT Team

A typographical error slipped into the sexagesimal position given
for the possible host in GCN 11575. The position should read:

RA = 00h 48m 55.37s
DEC = -34d 33m 58.3s (J2000)

The position given in degrees was correct.

Thanks go to Daniele Malesani for pointing this out.
