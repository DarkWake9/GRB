P.A. Price and R. McNaught (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the SXC error-circle of HETE trigger #2275 with the
SSO 40-inch telescope + CCD imager commencing at Aug 19.754 UT.  Our
3x300 sec exposures cover the entire error-circle to a limiting magnitude
of R ~ 20.5 mag.  We do not detect any obvious afterglow candidate upon
visual comparison with the DSS-2 red.  Further observations are underway.

This message may be cited.
