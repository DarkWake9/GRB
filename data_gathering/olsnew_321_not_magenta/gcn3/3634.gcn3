J.A. Kennea, D.N. Burrows (PSU), C. Hurkett, K. Page (U. Leicester) and
N. Gehrels (GSFC) report for the Swift XRT Team:

We have performed an initial analysis of the downlinked XRT data from 
GRB050717 (GCN 3633), and have found a fading, previously uncatalogued, 
point source in the field at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000):  14:17:24.9,
Dec(J2000): -50:32:13.2

with an estimated uncertainty of 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This source lies 50 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3633.
