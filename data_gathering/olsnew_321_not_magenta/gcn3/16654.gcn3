D. Denisenko, E. Gorbovskoy, V. Lipunov (Sternberg Astronomical
Institute, Moscow State University) report:

Since the error box of GRB 140801A (FERMI trigger 428612396) was not
covered by Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have used the digitized
Palomar plates of this area to create the color-combined finder chart
and to estimate the upper limits on the host galaxy of this burst.
There are in total 12 plates available (POSS-I red and blue ones from
1953 and 1954, two Quick-V plates from 1982 and six POSS-II plates
from 1991-1995: 2 blue, 2 red and 2 infrared). There is nothing at the
position of MASTER optical transient (Gorbovskoy et al., GCN 16653) on
any individual plates, as well as on their combination to the limiting
magnitude ~22.5.

5'x5' color-combined finder chart centered at MASTER OT
J025616.43+305617.0 is uploaded to
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/GRB/GRB140801A-BRIR5x5.jpg (position
of the OT is marked with dashes). We also note the nearby white dwarf
44" north of the OT which is marked by an arrow. It has the following
entries in the major catalogues:

USNO-B1.0 1209-0038230 (02 56 16.581 +30 57 02.09 pmRA=88 pmDE=32
B1=15.37 R1=15.54 B2=15.74 R2=16.06 I=16.20)
GALEX J025616.6+305702 (FUV=15.09+/-0.02 NUV=15.41+/-0.01)
2MASS J02561657+3057017 (J=16.12+/-0.09)

There is no mention of its variability in the literature. However, it
should be used with caution in photometric purposes.
