We observed the field of short GRB 180718A (Svinkin et al., GCN 22959) 
with the AMI Large Array at 15 GHz. Our observation on 2018 Jul 22.03 
(UT) (3.95 d post-burst) does not reveal any potential afterglow 
candidate consistent with the BAT location (Svinkin et al., GCN 22959), 
and our 3sigma upper limit to the flux density is 180 uJy.

We thank the MRAO staff for scheduling these observations. Results from 
the AMI Short GRB program are posted on the AMI-GRB database available 
at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
