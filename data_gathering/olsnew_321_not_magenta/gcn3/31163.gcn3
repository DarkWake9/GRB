C. Malacaria (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

Swift/BAT detected GRB 211203A at 09:02:38 UT (GCN 31160). 
There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event.
An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard
triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM identified no counterparts.
 
The GBM targeted search [1], the most sensitive, coherent search for
GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the Swift/BAT time.
From this search, no significant signal was found related
to GRB 211203A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in
arXiv:1612.02395, we set the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):

Timescale   Soft     Normal   Hard
-------------------------------------------
0.128 s:    4.7      9.2      17.0
1.024 s:    1.6      3.8      8.2
8.192 s:    0.4      0.9      2.0

These results are preliminary.
