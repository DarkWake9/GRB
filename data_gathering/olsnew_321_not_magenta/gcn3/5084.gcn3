At 01:53:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060507 (trigger=208870).  Swift did not slew because
of Earth observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 89.972,+75.237 {05h 59m 53s,+75d 14' 13"} (J2000) with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty). 
The lightcurve shows multiple peaks starting at ~T-8 sec and ending ~T+25 sec
with a peak count rate of ~1000 counts/sec at ~T+1 sec. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT and UVOT data products
to analyze.
