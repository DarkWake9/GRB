P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has initiated a ToO observation of the Fermi/LAT GRB 190731A. 
Automated analysis of the XRT data will be presented online at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020914

Any uncatalogued X-ray sources detected in this analysis will be
reported on this website and via GCN COUNTERPART notices. These are
not necessarily related to the Fermi/LAT event. Any X-ray source
considered to be a probable afterglow candidate will be reported via a 
GCN Circular after manual consideration.

Details of the XRT automated analysis methods are detailed in Evans et
al. (2007, A&A, 469, 379; 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177 and 2014, ApJS, 210, 8).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
