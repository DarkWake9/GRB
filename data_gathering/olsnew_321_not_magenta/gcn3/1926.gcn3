 We have observed the error box of GRB030227 (GCN 1896) in CrAO. Several
images were obtained with AT-64 (unfiltered) and AT-38  (R-band) telescopes.
No OT was found in place of the source S1-A (GCN 1907, 1910). Using
photometry by A. Henden (GCN 1917) we estimate the limiting magnitudes
(S/N=3) as following


 Start time (UT)       telescope   exposure    limiting mag.
Feb 27 16:58:10        AT-38       3x200 s      19.5 (R)
Feb 27 16:58:24        AT-64       5x120 s      19.2 (~R)
