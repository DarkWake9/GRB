report:

The optical afterglow of GRB 090323 (Updike et al., GCN 9026, Cenko et
al., GCN 9027) was observed with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope
(RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). We obtained
6x600s exposures in sdss-r filter, centered at March 25, 01:30 UT,
i.e. 2.059 days after the burst.

The afterglow is detected in all frames. Using the same calibration star
as it was used by Kann et al. (GCN 9033), we esimate the magnitude of
the OT as R=20.85+-0.04. During our observations we also marginally
detected gradual decline of the afterglow brightness at a rate of
approximately 0.3 mag/hour, which is steeper than that assumed by the
comparison with the data obtained by Perley et al. (GCN 9036).
