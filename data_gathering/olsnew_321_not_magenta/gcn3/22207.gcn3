A.J. Levan, J.D. Lyman (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), I. Mandel (U. Birmingham), J. Hjorth (DARK/NBI), A.S. Fruchter, T. Kangas (STScI), B. Gompertz, K. Wiersema, D. Steeghs (U. Warwick), S. Rosswog (Stockholm) report on behalf of a larger collaboration: 

"We obtained further observations of the counterpart of GW170817 with the Hubble Space Telescope. Observations took place on 6 Dec 2017 and utilised both optical (F606W, F814W) and infrared (F140W,F160W) filters. 

At the location of the transient we recover the source in both optical filters, but do not detect it in the infrared, where the background from the galaxy is higher. The measured magnitudes of the source in the optical bands are broadly consistent with the extrapolation from the 93 day radio epoch (Mooley et al. 2017 arXiv 1711.11573) to the near contemporaneous observations with Chandra (Troja et al. 2017 GCN 22201, Margutti et al. 2017 GCN 22202). 

We thank the staff of STScI for their excellent support with these observations."
