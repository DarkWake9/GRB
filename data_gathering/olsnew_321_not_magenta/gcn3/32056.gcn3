The long GRB 220514B
(MAXI/GSC detection: Kawakubo et al., GCN Circ. 32046)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

A Bayesian block analysis of the KW waiting mode data in
the 20-1500 keV band reveals a ~10 sigma count rate increase
over background in the interval from ~T0-26 s to ~T0+74 s,
where T0 = T0(MAXI) = 84261 s UT (23:24:21).

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220514B/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
6.59(-1.19,+1.61)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0-14.4 s, of 1.54(-0.43,+0.50)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0-26.2 s to ~T0+73.9 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff (CPL) model
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -0.82(-0.21,+0.33) and Ep = 263(-65,+112) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
