The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) data
around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S200213t
(GCN Circular 27042, 27092). Parameter estimation has been performed
using LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0,
distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB
event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200213t

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 2326 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 201 +/- 80 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

This supersedes the previous Bilby analysis (GCN Circular 27092), which
was done with an outdated estimate of detector calibration uncertainty.

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
