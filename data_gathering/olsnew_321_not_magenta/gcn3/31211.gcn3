The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:28:03 UT on 12 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211212A (trigger 660994088.510652 / 211212394).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 144.4, Dec = -2.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 37m, -2d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 114.0 degrees.
