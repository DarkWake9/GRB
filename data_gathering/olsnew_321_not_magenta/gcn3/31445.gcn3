O.J. Roberts (USRA/NASA-MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

“The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 220112832/663710289
at 19:58:04.04 UT on 12 January 2022, tentatively classified as a GRB,
is in fact not due to a GRB. This trigger is due to SGR 1935+2154.

Fermi-GBM has triggered on 29 bursts from the direction of SGR J1935+2154
since December 24th 2021, some of which may have been misclassified as GRBs.

This list at the time of writing (including the most recent one) is:

Fermi-GBM will not report on future triggers from this source during its current outbursting phase.

We encourage multi-wavelength observations to follow-up this most recent activation.
