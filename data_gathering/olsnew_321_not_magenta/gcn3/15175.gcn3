report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:47:32.37 UT on 03 September 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130903A (trigger 399862055 / 130903033),
which was also detected by the INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., GCN 15169) and
Swift/XRT (Grupe et al., GCN 15173).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL and Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 33 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 69 +/- 7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to T0+68 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.70 +/- 0.27 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 41 +/- 3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.0 +/- 0.1)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.22 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
