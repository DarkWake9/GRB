Using the data set from T-240 to T+700 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141017A (trigger #615672)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 16919).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 93.601, -58.596 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 14m 24.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 35' 45.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 64%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure.
The first peak starts at ~T-1 s, peaks at ~T+1 s, and ends at ~T+3s.
The second peak starts at ~T+40s, peaks at ~T+46s, and ends at ~T+60s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 55.7 +- 2.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.2 to T+65.1 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.05 +- 0.28,
and Epeak of 80.4 +- 17.2 keV (chi squared 39.44 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+46.60 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
6.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.66 +- 0.06 (chi squared 55.80 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
