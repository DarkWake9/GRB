J. Schaefer, S. Savage, S. Hwang, R. Canterna (U. Wyoming), M. Nysewander,
and D. Reichart (U. North Carolina) report:

We observed the entire ~200 square arcminute error box of GRB 021016 (GCN
1639, 1640, 1641) with the 0.6-meter Red Buttes Observatory telescope
beginning 15 hours, 39 hours, and 63 hours after the burst.  We integrated
without filter for ~1 hour per pointing x three pointings for each epoch.

Visual comparison between our first epoch and the DSS on the 17th revealed
no obvious counterpart to the limiting magnitude of the DSS.  Visual
comparison between our first and second epochs on the 18th and our first
and third epochs on the 19th revealed no obvious counterpart to the
limiting magnitude of our first epoch, which we estimate to be V ~ 22 mag.

Given the large error box and crowed field, we have confirmed this result
using the image differencing code ISIS-2 (Alard 2000).
