E. Maiorano (Univ. Bologna & IASF/CNR, Bologna), N. Masetti, E. Palazzi 
(IASF/CNR, Bologna), H. Navasardyan (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Asiago), 
E. Pian (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Trieste), L.A. Antonelli (INAF - Astron. 
Obs. of Rome) and D. Malesani (SISSA, Trieste), on behalf of a larger 
Italian collaboration, report:

"We have obtained BVRI images of the OT (Fox et al., GCN 1879) of
GRB030226 (Suzuki et al., GCN 1888) with the 1.82-m "Copernico" telescope
(plus AFOSC) of the Astronomical Observatory of Asiago (Italy).
Observations started on February 26.947 UT, i.e. 0.79 days after the GRB.
The seeing ranged between 2.0 and 2.4 arcsec.

The OT is well detected in all bands; we measure for it the following BVRI
magnitudes with respect to stars A and B (Garvanich et al., GCN 1885) and
using the photometry by Henden (GCN 1916):
