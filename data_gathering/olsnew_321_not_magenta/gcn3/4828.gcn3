TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4828
SUBJECT: GRB 060218: Refined analysis of the radio afterglow
DATE:    06/02/24 23:31:34 GMT
FROM:    Dale A. Frail at NRAO  <dfrail@nrao.edu>

Alicia M. Soderberg (Caltech) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Using additional data we have been able to obtain a flux calibration
of the radio afterglow detected with the VLA on February 20.01 UT
(GCN 4794). At 8.46 GHz the peak flux density was 453 +/- 77 microJy at
a position (epoch J2000) of R.A.=03:21:39.683, dec.+16:52:01.82, with
conservative errors of +/-0.06 arcsec.  Further observations are planned.

Science
Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
