D. A. Perley and A. Horesh (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 121209A (Maselli et al., GCN 14045) with 
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) at 
a frequency of 93 GHz (3mm) between 00:46 and 01:14 on 2012-12-10 (UT). 
The mean observation time was 3.01 hours after the GRB trigger.

No source is detected at the position of the X-ray afterglow (Goad et 
al., GCN 14051) or of the possible host galaxy (GCN 14049, Kruehler et 
al.).  The 3-sigma limit of the map is 1.8 mJy.
