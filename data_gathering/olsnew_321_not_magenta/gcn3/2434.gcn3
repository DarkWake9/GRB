(Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We searched the list of IPN error-boxes derived for GRBs detected 
between September 15 and October 28 2003,
for a spatial coincidence with SN 2003jd (Burket, Swift and Li, 2003; IAUC
8232), which is spectroscopically similar to SNe 1998bw and 2003dh,
associated with GRBs 980425 and 030329, respectively 
(Filippenko, Foley, and Swift 2003, IAUC 8234;
Matheson et al. 2003, IAUC 8234, GCN 2431).

We find that the position of SN 2003jd falls within the 3-sigma preliminary
error annulus of the short/hard GRB 030929 (Hurley et al. 2003; GCN 2409)
detected by Konus-Wind and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS).

Since the total area of IPN 3-sigma error-boxes and annuli derived 
between Sep. 15 and Oct. 28 2003 covers 5.6% of the entire sky,
and the reported error annulus is preliminary, this coincidence
may well be by mere chance. We also note that GRB 030929 is a 
short, hard burst, while previous events associated with SN 1998bw-like SNe Ic 
were of the long, soft variety. Additionally, if SN 2003jd is associated
with GRB 030929, the SN rise time (~30 days) is somewhat longer
than observed in previous cases (e.g., ~17 days, for SN 1998bw).

Further inspection of the relevant IPN data may shed more light on
this possible association.
