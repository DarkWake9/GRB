K. E. Heintz (Univ. of Iceland and DARK/NBI), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), and S. Schulze (Weizmann Institute) report on behalf of a larger collaboration, 

In our previous GCN (Heintz et al., GCN 21217) we reported a possible SDSS host galaxy at z=0.632. We note, however, that this identification was incorrect, as this galaxy lies a few arcseconds away from the GRB afterglow. However, further analysis of SDSS and Pan-STARRS images do show a possible host galaxy lying just 0.‚Äù8 of the afterglow position as measured by UVOT, with a faintness around the Pan-STARRS r-band detection limit.
