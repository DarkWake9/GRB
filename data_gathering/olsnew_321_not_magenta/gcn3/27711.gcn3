The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:41:16 UT on 10 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200510A (trigger 610800081.958626 / 200510445).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 155.1, Dec = -1.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 20m, -1d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67.0 degrees.
