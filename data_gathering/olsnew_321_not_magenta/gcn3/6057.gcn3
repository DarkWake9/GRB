We have imaged the field of GRB 070129(Godet et al. GCN6053) with the
TNT 0.8m telescope at Xinglong Observatory 11.98 hours after the burst.
Totally 10*300s R band images were obtained. The source identified by
Daniele Malesani et al.(GCN 6055,we assume the Dec coordinate reported
in this GCN is Dec(J2000)  = +11:41:04.0) was not seen in our combined
image, and no new source was find in the refined XRT circle,the 3-sigma
limit is ~21.1 derieved form USNO A-2.0.
