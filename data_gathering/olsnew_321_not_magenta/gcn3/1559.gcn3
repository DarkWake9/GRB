D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI and Konus observed this burst (GCN 1553).
Triangulation, as well as a detailed analysis of the Konus data,
indicate that this event originated from that section of the annulus
centered at RA, Decl(2000)= 173.261, +37.976 degrees, with radius
81.616 +/- 0.037 degrees (3 sigma), which lies between ecliptic
latitude +18 and +22 degrees.  This limits the annulus to the section
between RA, Dec= 252.4, -0.3 degrees, and 249.5, -3.9 degrees.
