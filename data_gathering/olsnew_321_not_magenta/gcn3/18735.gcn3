We report the observations of northern arc of the skymap defined by the 
BAYESTAR pipeline as reported GCN18728  with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope
(2.9 degree diameter FOV). 

We have mapped the arc from the southern point of RA=34.1174 DEC=10.129 
through to the northern tip at RA=86.394 DEC=53.6, corresponding 
to most of the 30% enclosed region in the northern arc of the BAYESTAR map. 

Observations were taken in the PS1 i-band (Tonry et al. 2012, ApJ 750, 99)
and at each pointing position a dithered sequence of 4 x 45 sec was taken, 
which will be combined as a single epoch stack. These dithered sequences
were repeated, with overlaps, to map the 30% region contiguously.  
A total of 371 individual 45 sec images were taken. 

Data taking began at  2015-12-28 05:07:49 and finished 2015-12-28 13:33:07
(UTC). 

The images are currently being differenced with respect to the Pan-STARRS
3Pi all sky i-band image (see Magnier et al. 2013, ApJS 205, 20 ; 
Huber et al. 2015,  ATel 7153) to detect transient objects. Further observations
of the region are planned as weather allows.
