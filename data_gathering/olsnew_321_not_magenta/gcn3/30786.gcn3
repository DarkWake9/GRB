The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:43:19 UT on 9 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210909A (trigger 652877004.365114 / 210909447).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 140.6, Dec = 83.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 22m, 83d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
