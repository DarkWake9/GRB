J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), D. Starr (UC Berkeley), and C. H. Blake  
(CfA/Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

For 11136 sec between 2007 Jan 28 02:54 UTC and 2007 Jan 28 09:37 we  
observed the field of GRB 070125 (Hurley et al. 6024) with the  
PAIRITEL 1.3m in Mt Hopkins, Arizona. Consistent with the afterglow  
position reported in Cenko & Fox (GCN 6028) we detect a faint  
(apparent point-like) source in J, H, and Ks band. The preliminary  
magnitudes are:

   J = 18.82  ± 0.26
  H = 18.33 ± 0.25
  Ks = 17.86 ±  0.25

This source appears to be embedded in the Eastern edge of an apparent  
galaxy, extending ~2.5" to the West from the OT; we associate this as  
the host galaxy of GRB 070125. At the Western edge of the "host"  
there is faint knot at position 07:51:17.49, +31:09:03.4 (J2000).

Few Swift GRB hosts are detected with similar integration times on  
PAIRITEL and those that have been are uniformly low redshift. Given  
this and the previous observational evidence for a low z (Prochaska  
et al. 6031, 6032; Marshall et al. 6041), we continue to urge long- 
term monitoring of GRB 070125 in search of any associated supernova.
