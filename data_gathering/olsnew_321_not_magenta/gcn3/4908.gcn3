TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4908
SUBJECT: GRB 060323: Swift/XRT position

J. A. Kennea, J. L. Racusin, D. N. Burrows (PSU), L. Vetere and
M. Perri (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

We have performed a preliminary analysis of downlinked data from GRB 060323
(Vetere et al, GCN 4904). We find a previously uncatalogued source at the
following coordinates:

RA(J2000):   11:37:45.4
Dec(J2000): +49:59:05.5

with an estimated uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
We note that this position lies 78 arcseconds from the BAT position 
reported in GCN 4904 and 88 arcseconds from the proposed UVOT afterglow 
candidate, which would rule out that object as the GRB afterglow.
