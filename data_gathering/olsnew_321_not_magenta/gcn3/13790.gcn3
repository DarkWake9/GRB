A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and S.R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.7 ks of XRT data for the GBM and IPN-detected burst
GRB 120919A (Rau et al. GCN Circ. 13785, Hurley et al.	GCN Circ.
13786), from 133.7 ks to 157.6 ks after the IPN trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.	Two uncatalogued X-ray sources
are detected within the IPN error box with the following refined XRT
positions :

Source 1 :

RA, Dec = 214.83981, -45.56220 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14h 19m 21.56s
Dec(J2000): -45d 33m 43.9s

with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 181 arcsec from the centre of the IPN error box. The
source is detected with a 0.3-10 keV count rate of 0.0067 +/- 0.0014
count/s, which corresponds to an observed flux of 2.7e-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1 for a typical GRB-like spectrum.

Source 2 :

RA, Dec =  214.79040, -45.56518 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14h 19m 09.70s
Dec(J2000): -45d 33m 54.66s

with an uncertainty of 5.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 57 arcsec from centre of the IPN error box. The source is
detected with a 0.3-10 keV count rate of 0.0037 +/- 0.0011 count/s,
which corrsponds to an observed flux of 1.5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a
typical GRB-like spectrum.

We cannot determine whether either of the sources are fading at the
present time.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
