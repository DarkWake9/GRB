B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), C. Swenson (PSU), P.A. Evans and 
M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 4385 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT 
images, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue): RA, Dec =
214.24065, -11.12845 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  14 16 57.76
Dec (J2000): -11 07 42.4

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
