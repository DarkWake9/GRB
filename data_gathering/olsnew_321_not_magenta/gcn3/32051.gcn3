WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to GRB 220408A detected by Fermi/GBM
(Fermi GBM Team, GCN 32038) and INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., GCN 32041),
starting at 04:21:03 UT, May 15th. Observations were performed
in the clear (roughly R) filter, and the exposure time was 60s per image,
with a total of 64 images were obtained. We marginally detected the
optical afterglow reported by de Wet et al. (GCN 32044) in our coadd image
in clear band, which we measured its brightness of 20.7 +/- 0.3 mag at a
mid time of ~0.69 days after the burst, calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1
catalog.
