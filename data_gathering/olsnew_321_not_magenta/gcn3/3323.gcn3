Localization Team report:

A 20 s long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 02:13:57 
UT on May 2. Being at the beginning of a pointing the GRB may last longer. 
Its coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  202.4392 [degrees]
DEC: +42.6741 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 1.3 
ph (1E-07 erg)/cmsq/s.
