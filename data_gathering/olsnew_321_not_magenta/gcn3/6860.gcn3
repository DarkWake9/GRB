Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 071010 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 293707) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 124.7s after the GRB trigger
(70.5s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
from 26 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detect a new rsising source in the error box given by SWIFT
at the following position (+/- 3 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 19h 12m 14.73s
DEC(J2000.0) = -32d 24' 07.1"

OT was R~15.6 at ~400s after GRB.

We continue to observe.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=  5.2380 lat=-18.2310
and the galactic extinction in R band is 1.3 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
