We observed the field of GRB 190211A (Marshall et al., GCN 23883) using 
the robotic NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. 
Observations started at 16:56:38 UT on 2019-02-11, i.e., 114 s after the 
BAT trigger. A series of 40 s, 60 s, 90 s, and 300 s R-band exposures 
were obtained and observations are ongoing.

An uncatalogued and fading optical source is detected at coordinates

R.A. (J2000) = 13:06:38.47
Dec. (J2000) = +41:58:04.93

with an error of the radius ~ 0.3 arcsec, being consistent with the XRT 
position (Marshall et al., GCN 23883). The source has m(R)~17.8 mag from 
our first 40s exposure. We thus conclude this source is the optical 
afterglow of the burst.
