K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 62905 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 7 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.8E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  3.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 332.088, -36.396 degrees, whose radius is 73.096 +/-  0.108
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus can be improved and/or constrained, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
