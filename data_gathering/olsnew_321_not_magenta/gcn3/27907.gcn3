of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 200608A (Moss et al. GCNC 
27906). The first image (clear filter) was obtained at 19:18:40 UT (~ 
1.83 hr after trigger). In the co-added image (5 exposures 30s each), no 
source is found at the region reported by Swift/BAT (Moss et al. GCNC 
27906) down to 17.4 mag.

The 60cm BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang Astronomical 
Observatory (China) also gathered images starting at 19:32:24 UT (~ 2.06 
hr after trigger). No optical afterglow is found down to 18.1 mag 
(unfiltered images) within the Swift/BAT error box.

Both observations were severely affected by the presence of the moon 
about 13 degrees away. We thank the staff at NIWA and YNO for their 
excellent support.
