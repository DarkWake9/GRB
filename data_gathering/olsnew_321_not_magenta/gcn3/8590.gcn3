M. Andreev, A. Sergeev, (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy), A. 
Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 081126  (Margutti et al GCN 8554) with the 
Z-600 telescope of Mt. Terskol observatory. Series of unfiltered   exposures 
were taken between Nov.26 (UT) 21:48:45 - 22:34:35. A photometry of the 
afterglow (Andreev et al, GCN 8558, Holland et al, GCN 8564) against 
USNO-B1.0 (R2) field stars is following

T0+   Exp.      Mag.  Err.
mid     s

 940  10È15     18.6  0.2
1203  10x30     18.8  0.2
1635   5x90     19.3  0.3
2375   7x90     19.8  0.3
2920   5x90     20.1  0.3

The photometry is compatible with a power law decay of a light curve with 
index of ~ -0.66.
