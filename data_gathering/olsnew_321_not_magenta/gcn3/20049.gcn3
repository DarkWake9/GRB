Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161014A (trigger #717500)
(Racusin, et al., GCN Circ. 20035).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 332.626, 7.467 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  22h 10m 30.1s
    Dec(J2000) = +07d 28' 01.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 13%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a complex structure starting at T-10 sec
and ending at T+15 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 18.3 +- 2.8 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.1 to T+12.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.47 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
