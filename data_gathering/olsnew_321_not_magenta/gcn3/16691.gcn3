V. Mangano (PSU), A. Vargas (PSU)  reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 2.4 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst:
GRB 140815A,  from 19.2 ks to 31.8 ks after the  INTEGRAL trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.  An X-ray source is
detected within the INTEGRAL error circle. Using 2156 s of PC mode data
and 2 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 86.89221, -8.68015 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 05h 47m 34.13s
Dec(J2000): -08d 40' 48.5"

with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 29 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position.  We cannot determine
at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
