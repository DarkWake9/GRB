TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3916
SUBJECT: GRB050904: Optical Observations
DATE:    05/09/04 16:19:06 GMT
FROM:    Aaron Price at AAVSO  <aaronp@aavso.org>

Dr. D.T. Durig (Cordell-Lorenz Observatory, University of the South),
Dennis Hohman (Stone Edge Observatory) and Aaron Price report on behalf of
the AAVSO International High Energy Network on observations of the field
of GRB050409 (GCN 3910; Cummings et al.).

 Durig does not detect any afterglow with SNR>3 on unfiltered images
centered at 08:30:59 UT. However, sources do exist with an SNR=3 at 
locations near that reported in GCN #3913 (Haislip et al.). Locations and 
magnitude:
   00 54 51.38 14 04 48.9 20.0 mag
   00 54 50.42 14 05 30.6 20.1 mag
   00 54 51.55 14 05 28.8 20.2 mag
 Full details, including a link to the FITS image is available at the 
bottom of this notice.
 Also, Hohman observed the field with an Rc filter centered on 06:18 UT 
and does not report any afterglow to Rc=18.6. Details on his observation 
are also below.
 
The AAVSO thanks the Curry Foundataion for their continued
support of the AVSO International High Energy Network.

 LimitingMag:  approx. 20.5
 Sky: clear but windy
 afterglowmag: NA
 afterglowerr: NA
 compstars: 850 USNO B1.0 in Full Frame
 Report: Total exposure 185 minutes (37x300 sec= 11,100 sec ). I see no 
afterglow at the reported position(s) above my detection limit but there 
appears to be three very dim diffuse sources nearby at

00 54 51.38 14 04 48.9 20.0 mag
00 54 50.42 14 05 30.6 20.1 mag
00 54 51.55 14 05 28.8 20.2 mag

All three are near my limiting mag with sigma equal to 3.

In the noise I measure

00 54 49.69 14 05 08.5 21.9 mag

but with sigma equal to 1.5 and below my detection limit of 20.5 mag.
