MASTER VWF robotic very wide field cameras (FOV=2x384 square degrees, 
D=72mm, f/1.2, 1 pix = 22 arcsec, http://observ.pereplet.ru) installed on 
MASTER-II robotic telescope syncronously covered ~15% part of 3 sigma 
FERMI-GBM error box (Xiong et al., GCN 15688). No credible transients have 
been found on our images. The 3 sigma unfiltered upper limit is 10.6.
MASTER-II robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the GRB140105A 21 sec after notice 
time and 45 sec after trigger time at 2014-01-05 01:33:46 UT.

After pointing by FERMI alert we cover 90% of 1-sigma and 70% of 3-sigma 
FERMI-GBM error box.  We didn't find new object in error box on single and 
coadd images. The 3 sigma upper limit on single 5 seconds exposure image 
is 10.6 and 12.0 on coadd of 24 images with total exposure 120 seconds.
The positions of all iPTF optical afterglow candidates (Singer et al., GCN 
15686) are covered by out cameras since 48 sec. after the trigger but 
there are no flares up to 10.6 mag. on their place.

The pointing time informations in our previous telegram Gorbovskoy et al. 
GCN 15692 are not correct. We apologize for this inaccuracy.
