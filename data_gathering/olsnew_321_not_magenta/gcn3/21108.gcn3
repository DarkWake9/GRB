L. Izzo, A. de Ugarte Postigo, Z. Cano, D.A. Kann (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration,

We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106) with the T24 (Plane Wave CDK 0.61m) of the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) located at Auberry, CA.  
A single image of 300 s was taken in the V filter, starting at 07:18:04 UT, 2.13 hr after the GRB trigger. The GRB optical afterglow is clearly detected with a preliminary photometry estimate of V ~ 18, as compared to field stars of the GSC2.3 catalog.
