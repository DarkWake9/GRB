Following the detection of Gaia19boq (Kostrzewa-Rutkowska et al., GCN 
24344) within the error area of the GW event S190426c (LVC, GCN 24237), 
we observed the target with the 1.5m telescope at the Observatorio de 
Sierra Nevada (Spain) in the BVI-bands, starting on May 1, 04:07 UT. 
Complementary images I ugriZ were taken starting on May 1, 11:41 UT at 
the 0.6m BOOTES-5/JGT in Observatorio Nacional de San Pedro Martir 
(Mexico). In addition, an optical spectrum (900s) covering the range 
3700-7500 A was obtained with the 10.4m GTC telescope equipped with 
OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) starting on May 1, 04:07 UT.

The Gaia19boq spectrum reveals strong Balmer lines in absorption, with 
the exception of a very weak H-alpha showing a P Cyg profile. All lines 
are redshifted ~400 km/s. Therefore we conclude that Gaia19boq is found 
to be a CVN star in outburst in our Galaxy and therefore unrelated to 
the GW event S190426c.

We acknowledge the excellent support from the GTC staff.
