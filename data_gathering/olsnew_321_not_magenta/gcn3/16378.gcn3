SUBJECT: Swift/XRT returns to normal observing

J. A. Kennea and D. N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT
team:

At 17:58UT on June 10th, 2014, Swifts X-ray Telescope (XRT) was commanded 
into Auto State, returning it to a normal observing setup. The mode of XRT 
operations described by GCN #16356 no longer applies. This means that 
Photon Counting mode data will now be taken with bias subtraction turned 
on and the low energy cut-off returned to the nominal value. XRT will 
produce prompt TDRSS GRB products for Swift/BAT detected bursts. Also we 
are no longer commanding observations manually, so GRBs and TOOs will be 
taken in the appropriate XRT mode.

At this time we continue to investigate the cause of the anomaly. This may 
require short periods of downtime for XRT while we run diagnostic tests, 
which may interrupt some observations. We expect the overall downtime due 
to these tests to be low (<5%). We apologize in advance for any 
observations that are interrupted.
