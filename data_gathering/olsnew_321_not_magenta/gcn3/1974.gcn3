NUMBER:  1974
SUBJECT: GRB 030328: Optical afterglow candidate

B.A. Peterson and P.A. Price (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 030328 (HETE #2650) with the SSO
40-inch telescope + WFI in B and R filters at Mar 28 12:37 UT.  We
identify a source not present on the DSS 2 red plate.  The coordinates of
this source are:

	RA: 12:10:48.4   Dec: -9:20:51.3   (J2000)

with an error of 0.4 arcsec in each coordinate.  At this stage, we
estimate that the afterglow candidate is roughly 18th magnitude.
Further observations are planned, and a finding chart will follow.
