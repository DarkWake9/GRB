the Swift Team:

At 14:44:47 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080916B (trigger=324907).  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 163.624, +69.044 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 54m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = +69d 02' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~750 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+18.9 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is G. Stratta (giulia.stratta AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
