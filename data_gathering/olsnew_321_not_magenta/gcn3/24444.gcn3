Gergely Dálya and Peter Raffai (Eotvos Univ.) reports on behalf of the GLADE
team:

We have found 69,543 galaxies in the GLADE catalog [1,2], within the 90% GW
localization area (bayestar.fits.gz) reported by the LVC in GCN 24442, and
within 269 +/- 108 Mpc distance limits.

The galaxies found can be accessed on the GLADE website (19.5 MB txt file;
please note that the order of galaxies in the list only follow the ordering
as the appear in GLADE):

There are 12,813 galaxies within the 50% GW localization area and within
the same distance limits (3.6 kB txt file; please note that the order of
galaxies in the list only follow the ordering as the appear in GLADE):
