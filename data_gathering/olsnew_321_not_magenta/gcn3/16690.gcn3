TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 140815A: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@iasf-milano.inaf.it>

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
D.Eckert (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 8 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 21:55:05 UT of 2014 August 15.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=   86.895698
DEC.=   -8.672829

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gave a peak flux of about 1 count/cm2/s (20-200 
keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 
3e-7 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
