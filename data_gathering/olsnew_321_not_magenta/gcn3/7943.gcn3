C. Clemens, S. Loew, J. Greiner, A. Yoldas, T. Kruehler (all MPE Garching), A. 
Kupcu Yoldas (ESO) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest and MPE Garching) 
report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080702B (Swift; Cummings et al., GCN #7924) 
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) 
mounted at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 09:14 UT on July 3rd, 2008, 32.1 hr after the GRB 
trigger with 53.6 min of effective exposures in g'r'i'z' and 56.0 min in JHK. 
They were carried out at an average seeing of 0.9".

We do not detect any object at the position of the 2nd XRT source within the 
6.3'' error circle reported by Evans et al. (GCN #7931) to the following 3 
sigma (optical) and 6 sigma (infrared) upper limits:

g' > 24.6 mag,
r' > 24.5 mag,
i' > 23.6 mag,
z' > 23.3 mag,
J > 22.0 mag,
H > 21.0 mag and
K > 19.0 mag.

Given upper limits are calibrated against USNO-B1 as well as 2MASS field 
stars.
