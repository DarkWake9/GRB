The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analyzed LIGO and Virgo data around the time of the compact
binary coalescence (CBC) candidate S190512at (GCN 24503). Parameter
estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky map,
LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via GCN Notice, is available for
retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190512at

The preferred skymap at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. For the
LALInference.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 252 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 1388 +/- 322 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
