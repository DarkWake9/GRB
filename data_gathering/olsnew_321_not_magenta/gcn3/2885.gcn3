S. Bradley Cenko reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

"We have imaged the position of the NIR afterglow of GRB041219 (Blake and
Bloom, GCN 2870) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope.  We detect
the presence of a faint source at this position, with a z-band magnitude
of 21.0 +/- 0.3.  The mean epoch of our observations is approximately
04:57 UT, December 20.

Further observations are planned."
