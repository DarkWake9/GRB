report on behalf of the Swift team:


On 2008-07-20 at 00:23:41 UT, Swift BAT detected an excess, and reported 
as a possible GRB (Trigger #317393; Cannizzo et al., GCN Circ. #7986). 
After refined BAT ground analysis, the excess is no longer significant. 
Furthermore, no uncatalogged sources were detected by Swift XRT or UVOT.
Therefore, we conclude that this trigger is not a GRB.
