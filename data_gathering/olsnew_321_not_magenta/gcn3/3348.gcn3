TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB 050504:  A long GRB detected with INTEGRAL

S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck, M. 
Turler (ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

A long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 08:00:52.5 UT 
on May 4. Its coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  200.9986 [degrees] 
DEC: +40.6959 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Note that this burst is located at high galactic latitude (b=+75 deg) and 
not affected by Galactic absorption. It is therefore a good target for 
optical follow-up searches.

Analysis of the IBIS/ISGRI data yields a peak flux of 0.5 photons (6E-8
ergs)/cmsq/s (1 s integration time) and a fluence of 14.4 photons (1.5E-6 
ergs)/cmsq (80 s integration time). Both values refer to the 20-200 keV energy 
range.

The burst lasted about 80 s and had a FRED profile. A plot of the light curve 
can be found at:
