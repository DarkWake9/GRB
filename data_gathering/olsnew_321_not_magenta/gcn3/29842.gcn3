Simone Leonini, M. Conti, P. Rosi and L.M. Tinjaca Ramirez (Montarrenti Observatory, Siena, Italy) report:

We observed the field of GRB210419C (Swift trigger 1044236, M.J. Moss et al., GCN Circ. 29834) with the automatic 0.53m RC telescope + U47 detector at Montarrenti Observatory (Siena, Italy, IAU code C88).

The observations were started under variable weather conditions at 2021-04-20 01:48:32 UT (3.780s after notice) stacking 12x30s clear filter CCD exposures.

We have not found optical transient within the error-box of the enhanced Swift-XRT position (RA 14h 11m 51.00s, Dec +36d 00m 26.7s - J2000).
Mag. upper limit R = 20.40+/-0.15


Magnitudes were obtained using Astrometrica software using USNO-B1 catalogue and are not corrected for galactic extinction.

Our non-detection is consistent with the limits reported by MASTER-Net (Lipunov et al, GCNC 29836) and KAIT (W.K. Zheng and A.V. Filippenko, GCNC 29840).
