DATE:    04/09/23 15:59:42 GMT
FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2004 Sept. 23.24 UT we carried out follow-up observations with the
VLA at 8.46 GHz toward two positions centered on the X-ray afterglow
candidates (GCN 2716; GCN 2731) of XRF 040912 (GCN 2723).  Within a
circle of 1-arcsec radius there are no radio sources toward either
X-ray candidate to a 3-sigma limit of 120 microJy.

No further observations are planned."
