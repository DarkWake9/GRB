Team:

At 19:21:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140213A (trigger=586569).  Swift did not slew to the burst immediately. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 105.218, -73.136 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 00m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 08' 10"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed two strong peaks 
starting at T-5, with a total duration of about 10 sec, followed by a 
third weaker pulse at T+15.  The peak count rate
was ~18,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+54.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. T. Holland (sholland AT stsci.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
