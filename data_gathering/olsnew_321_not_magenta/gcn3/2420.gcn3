TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2420
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB031014 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this event at 68810 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 60 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately 3.8E-07 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 168.643,  17.964 degrees, whose radius is 86.022 +/-  0.085
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved if data from other
spacecraft become available.
