FROM:    Oliver J Roberts at USRA/NASA  <oliver.roberts@nasa.gov>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 13:39:35.74 UT on 2 July 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220702A (trigger 678461980 / 220702569).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 160.0, Dec = 6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 40m, 6d 30'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 11.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75 degrees.
