Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), I. 
Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), M. D. 
Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ) and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a 
larger collaboration,
report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 200522A (Evans et al. 
GCNC 27778). The first image (clear filter) was obatined at high airmass 
starting at 18:31:37 UT(~ 6.8 hr after trigger). In the co-added image 
(15 exposures 60s each), no source is found at the position reported by 
Swift/XRT (Beardmore et al. GCNC 27780) down to 18.2 mag. Further 
observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
