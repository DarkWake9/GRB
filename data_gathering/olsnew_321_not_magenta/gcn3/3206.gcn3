of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We have obtained 20 unfiltered images of the GRB050408 (HETE 3711) error box
(Sakamoto et al., GCN 3189). The images were taken with the AT-64 telescope
of Crimean Astrophysical observatory and cover the period UT 18:19:33 -
18:45:57 of  April 08, 2005. No source was detected within SWIFT XRT error
box (Wells et al. GCN 3191) and at the position of the optical transient
(Ugarte et al., GCN 3192). Best limiting magnitude of the combined image
(S/N=3) calibrated against R USNO-A2.0 is following

Mid Time(UT)       telescope   exposure    limiting mag.
