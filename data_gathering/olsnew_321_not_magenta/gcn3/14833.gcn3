Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130608A (trigger #557771)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 14827).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 24.594, 41.485 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 38m 22.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 29' 05.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 45%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad peak starting at ~T-25 sec,
peaking at ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+50 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
44.4 +- 8.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-25.56 to T+24.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
3.21 +- 0.34.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.4 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+19.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
