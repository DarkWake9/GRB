(INAF-TNG), report on behalf of GRAWITA:

We observed the position of the 5 galaxies listed below, with the 3.6m 
Italian TNG telescope (Canary Islands, Spain), equipped with the NICS 
infrared camera in imaging mode.
These targets were selected from the list of probable host galaxies
generated by the HOGWARTS code (https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie/), 
consistent with the updated 90% probability region of S190814bv (LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25333). 
Similar lists were coordinated with collaborating
telescopes in La Palma and at ESO/VLT.

Each galaxy was observed for 20 minutes exposure in the Ks-band filter. 
Observations were carried out on 2019 Aug 16 between  01:50 and 04:40 
UT. Conditions were affected by seeing of ~2 arcseconds.

Visual inspection of the 5 fields does not reveal any new candidate 
compared with archival images from the 2MASS survey. The average upper 
limit of the images is Ks=19.7 mags (AB system).
