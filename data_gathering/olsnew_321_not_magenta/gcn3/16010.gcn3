K.L. Page, C. Pagani (U. Leicester) and J.K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5 ks of XRT data for GRB 140320A (Cannizzo et al. GCN
Circ. 16000), from 93 s to 11.8 ks after the BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. We detect a faint, uncatalogued
X-ray source with a mean count rate of (5.9 +/- 1.3) x 10^-3 count s^-1,
at a position of RA, Dec = 281.85583, -11.19333, which is equivalent to

RA(J2000) =   18 47 25.4
Dec(J2000) = -11 11 36.9

with an uncertainty of 5.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is 73
arcsec from the initial BAT position, within the BAT error circle. We
cannot determine at this time whether the source is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
