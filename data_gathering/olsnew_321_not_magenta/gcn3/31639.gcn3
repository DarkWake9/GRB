Y.-D. Hu, A. Sota, T.-R. Sun, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M. D. Caballero-Garcia, M. A. Castro Tirado and E. Fernandez-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva reported by ZTF (Ho et al., GCN 31619) and NICER (Pasham et al. GCNC 31635) which could be consistent with GRB220219B (Svinkin et al. GCNC 31624), images in BVRI bands were obtained at the 1.5m OSN telescope in Granada (Spain) starting on 22 Feb. 2022 at 01:49:51 UT. In single exposures (R-band, 90 s), we measure R = 19.80+-0.13 at 02:22 UT for the above-mentioned optical transient lying at the edge of the nearby galaxy at redshift z = 0.293 as reported by Gemini-North (Fremling et al. GCNC 31629). This detection is consistent with the report from Assy-Turgen (Kim et al. GCNC 31628).

We thank the staff at OSN for their excellent support.
