(U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Cucchiara, 
D. Morris (U. of Virgin Islands) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

One of the LCO 1-m units at Sutherland Observatory (South Africa) 
automatically began observing Swift GRB 180715A (Ukwatta et al. GCN 
22947) on July 15, 18:17:37 UT (10.5 minutes after the GRB trigger time) 
with the SDSS r' filter. Within the Swift-BAT error circle, well within 
the glare of a 8-mag catalogued object we clearly detect a source which 
is not present in the SDSS catalogue at the following position:

RA(J2000)=Â  15:40:22.30
DEC(J2000)= -00:54:44.4

with an error radius of ~1".
