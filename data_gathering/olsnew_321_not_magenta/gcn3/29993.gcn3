We observed the field of the likely short Fermi GRB 210510A (trigger
642367205, GCN #29981, Fermi GBM Team) with the DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager
at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir (
http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) on 2021-05-11 from 03:24 to 10:45 UTC (8.1
to  15.4 hours after the event).

We observed a region of 20.4 degrees in RA by 20.4 degrees in declination,
with a 3 x 2 grid, centered on the Fermi GBM Final Position RA = 192.330,
Dec = +44.860 (J2000 degrees). This region contains 6 instrumental fields
or about 400 square degrees. We obtained 2280 to 2400 seconds of exposure
per instrumental field in the w filter. We obtained AB photometry by
calibration against the APASS catalog.

We detect no likely candidate for the afterglow to our 10-sigma upper
limits of w = 20.20 to 20.42 (interquartile range).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
