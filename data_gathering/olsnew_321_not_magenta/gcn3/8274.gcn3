T. Nagayama (Kyoto University) reports on behalf of the IRSF/SIRIUS  
team:

We have imaged the field of GRB 080916C (van der Horst, GCN 8245)
based on the localization by Fermi/LAT (Tajima et al, GCN 8246) in J, H,
and Ks with the Simultaneous three-color InfraRed Imager for Unbiased
Survey (SIRIUS) on the Nagoya-SAAO 1.4m telescope (IRSF) starting at
2:53 on September 17 UT for 50 min.

The optical afterglow candidate suggested by Clemens et al. (GCN 8257,
GCN 8272) was detected marginally in H and Ks bands.
The preliminary magnitude was Ks= 18.6 +- 0.5.
