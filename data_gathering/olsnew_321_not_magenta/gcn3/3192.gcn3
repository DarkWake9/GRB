report:

Following the detection by HETE-2 of the long X-ray gamma-
ray burst GRB 050408 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 3189), we have
taken R-band images at the 1m and 6m telescope at the Special
Astrophysical observatory starting at 20.25 UT (i.e. 3.9 hr
after the event). Within the X-ray error box provided by
SWIFT/XRT (Wells et al. GCN 3191), we identify three
point-like sources. The brightest one (R = 20.5) is at
preliminary coordinates RA(2000) = 12 02 17.32, Dec(2000) =
+10 51 10 (error 1"), which we identify at the potential
GRB 050408 optical afterglow. The object does not appear in
the corresponding DSS-2 plate. Further observations are in
progress.

We thanks the SAO RAS director Yu. Balega for his support
for the SAO RAS GRB ToO programme.
