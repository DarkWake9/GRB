report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:54:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150413A (trigger=637899).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 190.385, +71.824 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 41m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = +71d 49' 26"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 120 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1100 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot observe until
T0+4 days. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. B. Markwardt (Craig.Markwardt AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
