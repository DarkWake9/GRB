Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220427A (trigger #1104343)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 31960).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 275.922, -56.257 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 23m 41.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -56d 15' 23.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 62%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that
starts at ~T+3 s and peaks at ~T+8 s, and followed by a long tail
emission that ends at ~T+70 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 57.2 +- 12.2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+3.09 to T+68.06 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.23 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+7.83 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
