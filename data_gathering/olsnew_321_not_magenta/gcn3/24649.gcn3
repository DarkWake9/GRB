and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190521r,
T0 = 2019-05-21 07:43:59.463 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24632), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-6 min to 
T0+11 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger
mode at the trigger time of S190521r. Using the CAL data, we have
searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from -60 
sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates.
There is no significant overlap with the LVC location probability map.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA = 225.3 deg, Dec = 51.4 deg at T0.
