K. D. Alexander, W. Fong, K. Paterson, and J. Rastinejad (Northwestern)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Fermi GRB 200826A (Fermi GBM Team GCN 28284; Mangan et al.
GCN 28287) at a mean frequency of 6 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA; Program 19B-217) beginning 2020 August 28.47 UT (2.28 days
after the burst). We detect a radio source with a preliminary flux density
of ~40 microJy at:

RA (J2000) = 00:27:08.54
Dec (J2000) = +34:01:38.37

with an uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec in each coordinate. This position is
fully consistent with the position of the optical afterglow candidate
ZTF20abwysqy (Ahumada et al. GCN 28295) and the catalogued galaxy. The
position is also on the outskirts of the Swift/XRT afterglow position (D'Ai
et al. GCN 28300; 90% confidence). Follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
