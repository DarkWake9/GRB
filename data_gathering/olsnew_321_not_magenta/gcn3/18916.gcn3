We continued observing the field of GRB 160117B with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org <http://www.ratir.org/>) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/01 21.17 to 2016/01 21.51 UTC (86.20
to 94.28 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 6.26 hours
exposure in the r and i bands.


The optical afterglow is still detected and in comparison with the USNO-B1 
catalog, we obtain the following detections:


  r	22.91 +/- 0.17
  i	22.39 +/- 0.10
  

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.

"16017" --> "160117".]
