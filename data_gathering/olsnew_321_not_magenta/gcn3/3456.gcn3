D. Allen, J. Silvey, and R. Canterna report on behalf of the Red Buttes Observatory Team of the FUN GRB Collaboration
 
We observed the position of the GRB050522 (Gotz et al., GCN 3446; Kennea et al., GCN 3452) with the Red Buttes Observatory 24-inch telescope under variable photometric conditions in RI bands on JD2453512. Within a FOV of 8 arcmin of the original INTEGRAL position (GCN 3346) and well within the refined Swift position (GCN 3452) we do not detect the afterglow or no new source down to the following limiting values:

10 sigma limiting magnitudes were derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue and photometric transformations from Landolt standards.
