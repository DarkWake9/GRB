B.-B. Zhang (PSU), Dirk Grupe (PSU) and D. Malesani (DARK/NBI)  report  on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed 2.0 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst:
GRB 130514B,  from 5.0 ks to 10.8 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.  An X-ray source is
detected within the INTEGRAL error circle. Using 1475 s of PC mode data
and 2 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 147.60859, -18.96517 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 09h 50m 26.06s
Dec(J2000): -18d 57' 54.6"

with an uncertainty of 1.8 arc sec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 37 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position. 

The X-ray source was detect with a peak count rate of 0.31 count/s 
at ~ T0+5359s, where T0= 2013 May 14 at 13:26:29.510 UT, then faded
to a count rate of 0.11 count/s at T0+11 ks.


A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.17 (+0.31, -0.30). The
best-fitting absorption column is  3.6 (+1.2, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.9 x 10^-11 (7.2 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.6 (+1.2, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 5.0 sigma
Photon index:	     2.17 (+0.31, -0.30)
