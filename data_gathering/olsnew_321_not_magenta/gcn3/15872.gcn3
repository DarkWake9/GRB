report on behalf of the Swift Team:



Swift-XRT has observed the central part of the error region of the 

IPN GRB 140219A in a series of observations tiled on the sky. 

The total exposure time is 5.9 ks spread over 3 fields; 

the maximum exposure within the sky observed was 3.9 ks. 

The observations started 70.3 ks after the IPN trigger.

Within these data there are 2 objects which are not catalogued in

X-rays. At the present time we cannot be sure which, if either, 

of these is the afterglow.

UVOT observed both of the XRT source regions.

In the region for XRT Source 1, UVOT finds a bright

optical source that we identify with the star

SDSS J102559.46+073114.1.

UVOT finds no optical counterpart to XRT Source 2

in a 803-second exposure with the white filter 

starting 82.3 ks after the trigger.

The preliminary 3-sigma upper limit 

using the UVOT photometric system 

(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373)

is 21.7 mag. No correction has been made

for Galactic extinction due to the reddening of

E(B-V) of 0.03 in the direction of the source

(Schlegel et al. 1998).
