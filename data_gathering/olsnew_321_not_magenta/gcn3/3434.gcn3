J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU), M. Perri (ASDC), J. Cummings (GSFC) and 
N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

INTEGRAL detected GRB050520 at 00:05:53 UT on 20th May 2005 (GCN Circ 
3430). The Swift observatory executed an Target of Opportunity observation 
of the INTEGRAL position and the XRT began taking data at 02:13:34 UT. In 
a preliminary data analysis we detect a uncataloged X-ray source located 
at:

RA(J2000) = 12:50:05.9,
Dec(J2000) = +30:27:01

We estimate an uncertainty of 5 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This 
position is 49 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position reported in GCN 3430. 
Observations are still underway and further ground analysis will be 
performed to determine if this X-ray source is fading.
