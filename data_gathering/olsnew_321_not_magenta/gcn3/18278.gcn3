on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB150910A (Pagani et al., GCNC 18264)
in Ks-band with a wide-field NIR camera at Okayama Astrophysical
Observatory (Japan). The camera has an effective aperture of 0.91m.

Observations started from 10:03 UT on 10th September, 59 min after
the BAT trigger, to 11:14 UT. The total exposure of 26 min was
successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we found a single point source at
  R.A.(J2000) = 00:22:39.84
  DEC (J2000) = +33:28:20.5
with an uncertainty of of about 2 arcsec.

We estimate the magnitude Ks = 14.85 +/- 0.13 (Vega).
The calibration was made against 2MASS field stars.
