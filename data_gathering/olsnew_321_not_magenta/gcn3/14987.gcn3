FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 130702 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at July 4 13.55 UT to
July 5 01.17 UT, i.e. 2.56 - 3.05 days after the burst (GCN 14972).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 1.23 +/- 0.04 mJy
at the position of the optical counterpart (GCN 14967).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for quickly scheduling and
obtaining these observations."
