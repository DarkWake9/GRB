report:


Using the Tautenburg 1.34-m Schmidt telescope  we have performed a 2nd
epoch observation of the error circle of GRB 051105A (Cummings et
al. 2005; Barbier et al. 2005, GCN 4194) starting on Oct 06, 17:30 UT,
i.e. about 34 hrs after the burst.

A comparison of the combined 2nd epoch image (9x5 min, R band) with
the combined image obtained during the first observing run (Klose et
al. 2005, GCN 4196) shows no obvious afterglow candidate in the error
circle of the XRT source S1 (Mineo et al. 2005, GCN 4195). The faint
R-band source which was reported in GCN 4196 has not disappeared and
shows no obvious evidence for a fading. Assuming  for simplicity a
power-law decay slope of alpha = 1.0, we would expect that if this
were the afterglow it would have faded below our detection limit.
