At the time of the G284239, Fermi was passing through the South Atlantic
Anomaly; therefore the GBM detectors were disabled.

Using the Earth Occultation technique (Wilson-Hodge et al. 2012, ApJS, 201,
33) to estimate the amount of persistent emission during a 48-hour period
centered on the LIGO trigger time, we place the following range of 3-sigma
day-averaged flux upper limits based on observed sources over the entire
LIGO sky map:

Energy       min  max  median
--------------------------------
 12- 27 keV: 0.07 0.56 0.10 Crab
 27- 50 keV: 0.13 0.84 0.17 Crab
 50-100 keV: 0.18 1.16 0.25 Crab
100-300 keV: 0.34 1.98 0.46 Crab
300-500 keV: 2.20 13.15 3.15 Crab

These limits are based on the minimum requirement that each source in the
Earth Occultation catalog was Earth-occulted at least 6 times in each of
the 24 hour periods preceding and following the LIGO trigger and that the
occultations were well separated from nearby bright sources.
