We observed the field of the Swift GRB 140102A (Hagen et al., GCN 15653)
with TAOS 0.5-m telescope of Lulin observatory (Taiwan) starting on Jan., 2
(UT) 21:19:49, i.e., 2.2 minutes after the trigger.

We detected the fading optical afterglow at the time between few early
optical afterglow observations (Xu et al., GCN 15655; Guziy et al., GCN
15685; Yoshii et al. GCN 15778). The details of the photometry were listed
below.

The R-band magnitude of nearby USNOB1 stars have been used for calibration.
We note that a special filter (5000-7200 A) was used in TAOS telescopes.
