K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN GRB teams, and R. M. Kippen, on behalf
of the BATSE GRB team, report:

This burst was initially localized to two alternate error boxes by the
IPN.  One of the error boxes was eliminated with >95% confidence by the
directional responses of some of the IPN detectors.  However, the error
box given in GCN 641 was unocculted to BATSE at the time of the burst,
and definitely should have been detected by it, but was not.  As the
alternate position was occulted to BATSE, we now believe it to be the
correct one.  It is a 220 sq. arcmin. error box, given by the following
preliminary coordinates:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 22 h  0 m 15.79 s     48 o 16 '  53.54 "  (CENTER)
 22 h  1 m 36.22 s     48 o 14 '  32.33 "  (CORNER)
 22 h  2 m  6.22 s     48 o  5 '  27.93 "  (CORNER)
 21 h 58 m 21.44 s     48 o 28 '  24.10 "  (CORNER)
 21 h 58 m 54.62 s     48 o 19 '  13.33 "  (CORNER)

The other parameters for the burst given in GCN 641 are unchanged.

KH apologizes for any inconvenience caused.
