W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

"The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 050915 (Swift trigger 155242;
Grupe et al. GCN 3977). A series of images was automatically
obtained from 11:27:32 UT (290s after the burst) to 12:21:36 UT
(3534s after the burst). The sequence includes a combination of 
images taken with the V and I filters, as well as some that are
unfiltered. We did not detect a new object in our images when
compared to the DSS II images. In particular, no new object was
found within the error circle of the revised XRT position
(Grupe et al. GCN 3983). Our first 15s unfiltered image started
at 290s after the burst has a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of about
18.2 when compared to the USNO-B1.0 catalog."
