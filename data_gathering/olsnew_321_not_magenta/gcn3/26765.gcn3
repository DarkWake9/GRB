Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200115j at T0 = 2020-01-15
04:23:09.742 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 50% of the S200115j 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) of the fluence
are obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions
within the accessible S200115j localization region, from a minimum of
1.4E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.6E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral
model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
