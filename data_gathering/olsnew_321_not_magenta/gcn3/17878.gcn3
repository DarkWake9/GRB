H.-F. Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:47:08.70 UT on 27 May 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150527A (trigger 454402031 / 150527283), 
which was also detected by Swift (Evans et al. 2015, GCN 17874).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 89 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows one single pulse with a duration (T90) 
of about 9.2 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from 
T0-3.072 s to T0+7.168 s is best fit by a power law function 
with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index 
is -0.76 +/- 0.20 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, 
is 319 +/- 97 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.2 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux 
measured starting from T0+2.304 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
