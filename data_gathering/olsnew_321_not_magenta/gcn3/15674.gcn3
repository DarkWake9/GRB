D. A. Perley (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report:

We imaged the location of Swift GRB 140102A (Hagen et al., GCN 15653), 
also detected by the Fermi/LAT (Sonbas et al., GCN 15659) with the 
Palomar 60-inch (P60) robotic telescope on UT 2014-01-03 between 12:01 
and 12:45 UT, in the g, r, i, and z filters.

The afterglow is marginally detected in individual exposures, and 
clearly detected after stacking all of the observations in each filter. 
Photometry of the stacks relative to SDSS stars in the field gives 
magnitudes (at a common midpoint of approximately 12:23 UT, t=0.63 days 
after the trigger) of:

g = 22.08 +/- 0.10
r = 21.59 +/- 0.09
i = 21.37 +/- 0.10

[GCN OPS NOTE(07jan14):  Changed the "130102A" in the first line
to "140102A".]
