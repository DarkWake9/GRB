TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4940
SUBJECT: HETE Trigger 4043: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    06/03/31 19:02:10 GMT
FROM:    Eli Rykoff at U of Michigan/ROTSE  <erykoff@umich.edu>

E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), S.A. Yost (U Mich), H. Swan (U Mich), report on 
behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded
to HETE Trigger #6063 (Fenimore, et al, GCN 4938), producing images 
beginning 7.2 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took 
the first image at 15:32:47.2 UT, 31864 s after the burst, under fair 
conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 80+ 60-sec eposures. These 
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
WXM error box described in GCN 4938.  Individual images have limiting 
magnitudes ranging from 15.8-17.2; we set the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
