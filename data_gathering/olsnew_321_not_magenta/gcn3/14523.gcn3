Aman Kaur, Dieter Hartmann (Clemson University), and William C. Keel (U.
of Alabama, Tuscaloosa),  report:

We continued our observations of GRB 130427A (Maselli, et al., GCN 14448) 
with the SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO  (http://saraobservatory.org)
starting on April 29. We obtained a total of 190 min exposure in the R
band, with a sequence of 36 five min exposures,  and one ten  min
exposure.

We detect the optical afterglow (Elenin et al; GCN14450) decay between  R
= 19.2 and R = 19.4
during that sequence, which implies a temporal power law decay of the flux
density with a slope of
alpha ~ 0.8

Magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction.
