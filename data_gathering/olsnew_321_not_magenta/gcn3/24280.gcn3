report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the GW trigger time
(T0=2019-04-26 15:21:55 UTC). At T0, about 100% of the LIGO
localization region was covered by the Insight-HXMT without occultation
by the Earth.

Within T0 Â± 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the GW counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales(1 s, 10 s) from the peak 
position of the LIGO-Virgo location probability map, the 5-sigma 
upper-limits fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1s: 7.4e-07 erg cm^-2   
10s: 3.9e-06 erg cm^-2 

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1s: 1.0e-06 erg cm^-2   
10s: 5.6e-06 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1s: 9.6e-07 erg cm^-2  
10s: 5.0e-06 erg cm^-2 

Further analysis will be reported in the following circulars.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
