On UT 2020 November 5 and 8 we observed the radio counterpart of the
GRB 201015A (D’Elia V. et al., GCN Circ. 28632) with e-MERLIN at 5 GHz.
We detect a point-like source at a position consistent with the VLA
GRB 201015A afterglow coordinates (RA(J2000) = 23:37:16.41,
Dec(J2000)= +53:24:56.4, Fong W. et al., GCN Circ. 28688).

Preliminary analysis indicates a significance of the detection of 4.5
and 3.3 sigma confidence for November 5 and 8 observations respectively.
We note that the noise level in the November 8 observation is 20% higher
than on November 5.

Additional radio observations are in progress.

We would like to thank the e-MERLIN personnel for approving, executing,
and processing these observations.
