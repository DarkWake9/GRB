D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck (ISDC, 
Versoix), J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization 
Team and N. Lund (DSRI, Copenhagen) on behalf of the ISWT report:

Offline analysis of the IBAS data showed that GRB 050525 discovered by 
Swift (Band et al. GCN 3466, Markwardt et al. GCN 3467), has been detected 
also by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL.

The burst occurred at an off-axis angle of 14.7 degrees, very close to the 
edge of the IBIS/ISGRI field of view, and illuminated through the coded 
mask only 6% of the detector surface.

The preliminary value of the peak flux is 33 photons (3.2E-6 ergs)/cmsq/s 
(1 sec integration time, 20-200 keV).

Owing to a small gap caused by telemetry saturation, we can only derive a 
lower limit on the fluence of 144 photons (1.2E-5 ergs)/cmsq (12 s 
integration time, 20-200 keV).
