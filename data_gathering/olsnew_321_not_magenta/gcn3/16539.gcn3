Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140706A (trigger #603587)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 16531).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 49.269, -38.058 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  03h 17m 04.6s 
  Dec(J2000) = -38d 03' 28.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several peaks starting at ~T-20 sec, 
peaking at ~T-15, ~T+1 and ~T+28 sec, and ending at ~T+40 sec.  
T90 (15-350 keV) is 48.3 +- 4.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-21.3 to T+39.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.8 +- 0.1.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.12 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
