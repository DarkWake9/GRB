TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  5960
SUBJECT: GRB 061222B: TAROT La Silla observatory afterglow observation
DATE:    06/12/22 05:21:30 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We analyzed carefully the afterglow position
provided by Berger GNC Circ. 5956 on TAROT
la Silla images. A very faint source is detected
only on the first 30s image obtained from
150 to 180 seconds after the trigger.

We estimate a magnitude R=18.2 +/- 0.5 (S/N=2).

N.B. As we mentioned in the GCN Circ. 5959,
the GRB position is near the star USNO-B1.0
0641-0103283 (R=9.3). The afterglow lies at the
end of a "arm spider" of the star.
