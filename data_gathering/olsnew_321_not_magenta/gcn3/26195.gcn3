and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S191105e,
T0 = 2019-11-05 14:35:21.933 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 26182), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-6 min to 
T0+27 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy trigger
mode at the trigger time of S191105e. Using the CAL data, we have
searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from -60 sec
to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates. There
is no significant overlap with the LVC high probability localization 
region.  The CAL FOV was centered at RA=223.0 deg, Dec=-27.4 deg 
at T0.
