TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6636
SUBJECT: GRB 070714A: Swift-BAT T_zero
DATE:    07/07/17 13:29:12 GMT
FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>

S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC)
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

It has been noted by several people (D. Grupe, M. Chester, and F. Marshall)
that the T_zero trigger time for GRB 070714A (Grupe, et al., 6619;
Barthelmy et al., 6622) is missing from the standard set of communications
on this burst.  Normally T_zero is published in the Notices and the
"first Swift Circular" on the burst.  But because all the TDRSS messages
were lost due to a TDRSS outage, we dropped the ball on this in the later
circular.

The trigger time for GRB 070714A (trigger 284850) is 03:20:30.618 UT.
