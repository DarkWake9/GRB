J. A. Kennea (PSU) and M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the
Swift/XRT team:

At 12:08:17 UT, Swift XRT began observing GRB 070107. Although no X-ray
counterpart was found by the on-board software, analysis of downlinked
data reveals a bright, flaring, uncatalogued point source at the following
location:

RA(J2000) = 10h 37m 36.1,
Dec(J2000) = -53d 12m 46.9s,

with an estimated uncertainty of 10 arcseconds radius (90% contrainment).
This position lies 24 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN
5999.
