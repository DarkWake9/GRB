E. Berger, J. Mulchaey (Carnegie Observatories), N. Morrell, and W.  
Krzeminski (LCO) report:

"We imaged the BAT error circle of GRB 050416b (GCN 3279) with the Swope
40-inch telescope (r-band) and the du Pont 100-inch telescope (I-band) at
LCO starting on 2005, April 17.001 and 17.002 UT, respectively (86 and 114
min after the burst).  We also obtained a 5-minute image with IMACS on the
Magellan/Baade telescope in R-band.  A comparison to DSS reveals no new
sources to the depth of the survey in any of our images."
