The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:19:16 UT on 10 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190510A (trigger 579176361.043888 / 190510430).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 128.1, Dec = 33.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 32m, 33d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
