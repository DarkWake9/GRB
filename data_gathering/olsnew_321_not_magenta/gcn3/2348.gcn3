E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 11410
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
500 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.6E-05 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  9.8E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary 3 sigma error box with
approximate area 4000 square arcminutes whose coordinates are:


 ERROR BOX CENTER:  16 h 43 m 54.09 s    -41 o 23 '   8.82 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 16 h 46 m 51.75 s    -39 o 33 '  37.20 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 16 h 52 m 11.07 s    -36 o 20 '  58.04 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 16 h 32 m 52.34 s    -47 o 36 '  48.22 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 16 h 40 m 38.79 s    -43 o 20 '  34.91 " 

This error box may be improved, but because Ulysses, Earth, and
Mars are practically aligned, a small error box cannot be derived
for this event.
