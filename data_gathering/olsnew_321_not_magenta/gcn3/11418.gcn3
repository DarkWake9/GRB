S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) and E. O. Ofek (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the MAXI/GSC X-ray transient XRF 101117A
(Yamazaki et al., GCN 11410) with the Palomar 48 inch Schmidt telescope as
part of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; Law et al., PASP, 121, 1395;
Rau et al., PASP, 121, 1334).  Images were obtained with a Mould R filter
beginning at 6:02 UT on 18 November 2011 (~ 22.5 hours after the MAXI/GSC
trigger) and cover > 90% of the reported localization region.

Comparison with pre-explosion images from the Digitized Sky Survey reveals
no new transient sources within the reported error box.  Referencing our
images to a series of point sources from the USNO-B1 catalog, we place a
limiting magnitude of R > 20 at this time.
