We have analyzed the first 9 orbits of XRT data from GRB 060714
(Krimm et al., GCN 5311). A 4.2 ks Photon Counting mode image provides
a refined XRT position:

RA(J2000)  =  15h 11m 26.5s,
Dec(J2000) = -06d 33m 59.3s

with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcsec (90% containment). This position is 1.2
arcsec away from the on-board UVOT position of the optical afterglow
reported in GCN 5311.

The X-ray light curve displays two flares during the first orbit at about
140 and 180 seconds after the BAT trigger. The afterglow decay from T+300s
to T+40ks can be fit with a broken power-law with an initial decay
slope of -0.4+/-0.2, a break at 3.7 (+1.7)(- 1.0) ks, and a post-break
slope of -1.29+/-0.15.

A power-law fit to the 0.3-10 keV spectrum from T+107s to T+248s gives a
photon index of 1.97+/-0.05 and a column density of
(1.89+/-0.15)e21 cm**-2. We note the Galactic hydrogen column density
in the direction of the burst is 6.7e20cm**-2.

If the burst continues decaying at the current rate we estimate a
0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux of ~6e-13 ergs cm**-2 s**-1 at T+24hr.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
