P. D'Avanzo and S. Covino (INAF/OABr) report on behalf of the MISTICI 
collaboration:

We re-observed the field of the short GRB 070724A (Ziaeepour et al., GCN 
6654) with the ESO-VLT equipped with FORS2 (see Covino et al. GCN 6666). 
An image subtraction analysis, performed with the ISIS package (Alard 
200, A&AS, 144, 363) between the two imaging epochs (0.93 and 1.84 days 
after the burst, respectively), revealed that neither the galaxy 
reported by Bloom (GCN 6658) and Cenko et al. (GCN 6664) nor the object 
reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 6664) varied.
