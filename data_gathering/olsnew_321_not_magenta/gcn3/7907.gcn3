report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed again the field of GRB 080625 (Pacciani et al.
GCN 7903) using the 1.5m OSN telescope at Sierra Nevada
Observatory (Granada, Spain) at a mean epoch of 14.76h after the
burst. The object identified by Immler et al. (GCN 7905) is well
detected in this and in our previous epoch (GCN 7904). A preliminary
photometry against USNO-B1.0 stars shows the object decaying, as
seen in the following table:

t-t0 (hours)  Exp (s)   I mag
8.325           4x300    19.3+/-0.2
14.769         3x300    20.0+/-0.2
