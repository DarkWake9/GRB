D. Kuroda (JAXA/ISAS), K. Yanagisawa (OAO), and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech)
report on behalf of MITSUME collaboration:

"We observed the field covering the entire error circle of GRB050408
(GCN 3189, Sakamoto et al.) with the 50 cm Mitsume Telescope at Okayama,
Japan in V, R, and I bands from 17:49 to 18:32 (UT), and obtained 37
frames of 60 sec exposure.

Comparison of the co-added image to the DSS revealed no new objects
down to a limiting magnitude of R=17.8 as estimated using USNO A2.0 
catalog."
