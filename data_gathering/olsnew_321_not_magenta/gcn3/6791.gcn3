behalf of the Swift Team:

At 07:33:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070917 (trigger=291292). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 293.925, +2.413 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 35m 42s
   Dec(J2000) = +02d 24' 47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a FRED
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~22000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled.  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. R. Cummings (jayc AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
