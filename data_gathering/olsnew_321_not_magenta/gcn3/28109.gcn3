The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:26:37 UT on 16 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200716A (trigger 616555602.759372 / 200716060).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 134.8, Dec = -15.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 59m, -15d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 76.0 degrees.
