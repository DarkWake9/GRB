The bright GRB 190706C (IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN
Circ. 25035) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 13:42:22.560 UTC on 6 July 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked emission episode which
starts at T+3.5 sec, peaks at T+6.6 sec and ends at T+10.4 sec. The T90
and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 3.9 +- 0.8 sec and
2.2 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

Despite the burst high intensity there is almost no emission above ~1 MeV.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
