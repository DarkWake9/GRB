Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080430 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 310613) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 18.8s after the GRB trigger
(7.2s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
from 82 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detect a new fading source in the error box given by SWIFT
at the following position (+/- 3 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 11h 01m 14.2s
DEC(J2000.0) +51d 41' 08"

OT was R~16 at 18.8s after GRB.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=155.5591 lat=+57.8882
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.0 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
