V. Beckmann (APC), M. Beck, C. Ferrigno, V. Savchenko, Ievgen Vovk (ISDC), J.
Borkowski (CAMK/Torun), D. Götz (CEA/Saclay), S. Mereghetti
(INAF/IASF-Milano), and A. von Kienlin (MPE) report on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team:

GRB 100628A, detected in Swift/BAT data (Immler et al., GCN 10895;
Barthelmy et al., GCN 10896), is detectable also in the data of the  
SPI Anti-Coincidence System (ACS) on-board INTEGRAL. The SPI-ACS light  
curve shows the peak of the burst at 2010-06-28T08:16:41 with a  
maximum count-rate of ~600
counts/50msec. The duration of the GRB is about 0.05 seconds.

The SPI-ACS light curves are available (both as images and data files)
at http://isdc.unige.ch/Soft/ibas/ibas_acs_web.cgi

The light curves, binned at 50 ms, are derived from 91 independent
detectors with different lower energy thresholds (mainly between 50 keV
and 150 keV) and an upper threshold at about 100 MeV. The ACS response
varies as a function of the GRB incident angle. For these reasons we
caution that the count rates cannot be easily translated into physical
flux units. It is not possible to localize a burst based on the SPI-ACS data.
