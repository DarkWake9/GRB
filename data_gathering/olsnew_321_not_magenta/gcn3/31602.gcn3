We observed the fast and red optical transient ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc (GCN Circ. 31590), also detected by VLA (GCN Circ. 31592), Zeiss-1000 (GCN Circ. 31593), LT (GCN Circ. 31594), GMOS-N (GCN Circ. 31595), GIT (GCN Circ. 31597), and NICER (GCN Circ. 31601), using the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.

A spectrum was secured covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and consisting of 4 exposures of 1200 s each. The observation was carried out about six days after the transient discovery.

In a preliminary reduction, the continuum is detected over the full spectral range. An emission line is detected at 10981 AA, which we interpret as due to OIII 5007 at a redshift of 1.193. The corresponding OIII 4959 line falls on a telluric feature, so it is not detected in our spectrum. Moreover, the Halpha emission line is in a telluric gap. However, a set of absorption lines from Mg (MgII 2796, MgII 2803 and MgI 2803), FeII (2344, 2383, 2586, 2600), and CaII (3934, 3969) are present at a consistent redshift. Thus we interpret it as the redshift of the transient. We note that the NICER X-ray detection (GCN Circ. 31601) is very bright if at this redshift.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in Paranal, in particular Claudia Paladini and Ditte Slumstrup.
