The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:24:42 UT on 15 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220715B (trigger 679616687.73956 / 220715934).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 221.7, Dec = -36.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 46m, -36d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 87.0 degrees.
