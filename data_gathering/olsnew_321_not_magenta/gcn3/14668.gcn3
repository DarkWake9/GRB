The short-duration GRB 130515A (Swift-BAT trigger #555880:
Malesani et al., GCN 14650, Barthelmy et al., GCN 14658;
Fermi-GBM detection: Jenke, GCN 14663)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=04880.440s UT (01:21:20.440)

The burst light curve shows a single pulse
from ~T0-0.05 s to ~T0-0.2 s, with a total duration of ~0.25s.
The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB130515_T04880/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of (1.1 ± 0.2)x10-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak flux,
measured from T0-0.016 s, of (2.1 ± 0.5)x10-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

Modelling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = 0.0 ± 0.4, and Ep = 410 ± 90 keV

Modelling the K-W 3-channel spectrum at the maximum count rate
(from T0-0.064 s to T0)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
yields alpha = -0.5 ± 0.4, and Ep = 715 ± 360 keV


All the quoted errors are at the 1 sigma confidence level.
