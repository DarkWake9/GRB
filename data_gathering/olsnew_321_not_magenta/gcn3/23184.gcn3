SUBJECT: GRB 180828A / Swift J1754.9-2548: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    18/08/29 07:03:44 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 973 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT
images, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue)  RA, Dec = 268.71784, -25.79805 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  17 54 52.28
Dec (J2000): -25 47 53.0

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed athttp://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

Preliminary analysis of the XRT light curve (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/00856977/)
suggests that this object is likely a GRB, not a Galactic transient. Analysis is ongoing.
