For the recent GRB on 28 Aug 97, Shri Kulkarni et al. report the following:


   GRB 970828

   S. C. Odewahn, S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) and D. A.
   Frail (NRAO) report:  "We have examined CCD images of the field of GRB
   970828 obtained at the Palomar 200-inch Hale telescope by T. Herter,
   F. Fang and O. Pevunova on August 29, UT and compared them to images
   obtained by Steidel, Adelberger and Kellog on August 30, 31 and
   September 1 UT (and reported in IAUC 6370).  Our preliminary analyis
   shows no objects brighter than about R magnitude of 24.5 within the
   ASCA/RXTE/IPN error-box (see IAUC 6728, 6731), which changed
   significantly by more than 0.2 magnitudes per day within this time
   interval.  This places severe limit on the peak brightness of any
   possible optical transient associated with this burst."
