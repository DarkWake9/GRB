TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

L.J. Pellizza (CEA Saclay, France & IAFE, Argentina), P.-A. Duc
(CEA Saclay, France), E. Le Floc'h (Steward Obs., USA), & I.F.
Mirabel (ESO), on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration.

We imaged the field of GRB 050223 (Mitani et al. 2005, GCN 3055)
on May 10, 2005 and June 5, 2005. R (10 x 308 seconds) and Ks
(42 x 60 seconds) frames were obtained respectively with FORS1 and
ISAAC at VLT. In the combined R and Ks images we detect a single
galaxy within the revised XRT error circle (Moretti et al. 2006,
A&A, 448, L9), down to our limiting magnitudes R_lim ~ 26 and
Ks_lim ~ 21. Its position is RA(J2000) = 18:05:32.99, DEC(J2000) =
-62:28:18.8 (0.2 arcsec error), We measured R = 21.6 and Ks = 18.9
for this object (with an uncertainty of ~0.1 mag). Astrometry was
performed using USNO B1.0 stars, while photometry was calibrated
against 2MASS and USNO B1.0 (second epoch) magnitudes.
