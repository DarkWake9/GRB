report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 00:35:39.28 UT on 06 June 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor

(GBM) triggered and located GRB 220606A (trigger 676168544 / 220606025,

GCN 32164), which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO

(A. Tohuvavohu et al. 2022, GCN 32171).


The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks with a duration (T90)

of about 19.7 +/- 1.6 s (50-300 keV).


The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.560 s to T0+17.664 s is well fit

by a simple power law with index = -1.37 +/- 0.03.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is

(2.88 +/- 0.17)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured

starting from T0-0.64 s in the 10-1000 keV band is

1.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;

final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
