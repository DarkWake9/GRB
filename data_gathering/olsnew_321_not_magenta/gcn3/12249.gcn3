The short extremely hard GRB 110802A
(localized by IPN: Hurley et al., GCN 12247)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=55156.191s UT (15:19:16.191)

The burst light curve shows a single double-peaked pulse,
the total duration of the burst is ~0.6 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB110802_T55156/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.3 ± 0.3)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.032 s,
of (5.0 ± 1.6)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fitted in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.63 (-0.25, +0.31),
and Ep = 3451(-1086, +2256) keV,
chi2 = 24.0/24 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
