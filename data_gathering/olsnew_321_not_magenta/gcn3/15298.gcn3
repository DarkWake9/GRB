Using the data set from T-240 to T+418 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 131002B (trigger #572742)
(Stroh, et al., GCN Circ. 15284).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 75.135, -75.701 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  05h 00m 32.4s
  Dec(J2000) = -75d 42' 05.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single wide peak that has a main pulse
starts at ~T-6 and ends at ~T+20, and the remaining emission lasts until ~T+42.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 39.10 +- 8.08 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.95 to T+41.60 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.36 +- 0.84,
and Epeak of 34.0 +- 4.3 keV (chi squared 62.16 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.2 +- 0.6 x 10^-07 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+5.48 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 2.15 +- 0.14 (chi squared 81.27 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
