The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:36:31 UT on 12 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200112A (trigger 600525396.101104 / 200112525).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 150.1, Dec = 64.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 00m, 64d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118.0 degrees.
