K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline,
E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind
GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind observed GRB010613 (HETE trigger 1547,
GCN/HETE Burst Position Socket Message of June 15  16:28:49 UT).  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approx. 150 s, a
25-100 keV fluence of approx. 1.4E-05 erg/cm^2, and a peak
flux over 0.25 s of approx. 6.8E-07 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated
it to an annulus centered at RA(2000)=195.710 o, Decl(2000)=
-21.239 o, with radius 68.322 +/- 0.128 o (3 sigma).

This annulus intersects the HETE WXM error circle to form
an approximately trapezoidal error box whose coordinates
are:

RA(2000)   Decl(2000)
255.603    +13.840
255.000    +14.844
255.380    +13.703
254.766    +14.723

The area of this combined error box is approx. 1000 sq. armin.,
or about 4 times smaller than the WXM error circle
area.  Some improvement to this annulus is possible.
