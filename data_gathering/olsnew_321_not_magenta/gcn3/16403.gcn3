(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed a field of the GBM GRB 140606B / iPTF 14bfu (Singer et al.,
GCN 16360) with with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy). We 
obtained several images on June, 08 (UT) 17:17:29 with exposure of each 
frame of 120 s. The  optical transient Singer et al., GCN 16360) is well 
detected on the stacked image. A photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 
stars:

The light curve based on published photometry in r, R and unfiltered 
observations (GCNs 16360, 16362, 16367, 16398) can be found in

Based on the lc  above one can suggest that a host galaxy of GRB 140606B 
may influence on the photometry of the afterglow.
