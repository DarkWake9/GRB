D.Svinkin, S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, D. Frederiks, A. Kozlova,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The short-duration GRB 180317A has been detected by
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL(SPI-ACS), and Swift(BAT) at about 61285 s UT 
(17:01:25). The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    92.196 (06h 08m 47s) +23.164 (+23d 09' 50")
  Corners:
    92.178 (06h 08m 43s) +21.042 (+21d 02' 32")
    92.100 (06h 08m 24s) +23.291 (+23d 17' 27")
    92.237 (06h 08m 57s) +25.258 (+25d 15' 28")
    92.293 (06h 09m 10s) +23.037 (+23d 02' 13")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1373 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 4.22 deg (the minimum one is 10.2 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 94 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
