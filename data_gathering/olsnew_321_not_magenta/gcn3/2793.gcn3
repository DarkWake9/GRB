TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2793
SUBJECT: IBAS GRB Alert # 2010

D. Gotz & S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano) on behalf of the IBAS Localization
Team, N.Mowlavi and J. Soldan (ISDC) report:

IBAS Alert number 2010 corresponds to a 40 s long burst detected in the
15-100 keV energy range. Its refined coordinates are (J2000)

R.A. = 17h 40m 43s

Dec. = -28s 07' 32''

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin.

Due to the fact that this position is consistent with the X-ray source
SBM2001 10 (SIDOLI L., BELLONI T., MEREGHETTI S., Astron. Astrophys., 368,
835-844 (2001)), and that its preliminary spectrum is soft, it is unlikely
that this is a GRB.

Nevertheless further observations are encouraged.

This message can be cited.
