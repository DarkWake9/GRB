The HAWC collaboration reports:
We present here a follow-up of the HAWC alert presented on the circular
30183 (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/30183.gcn3).
The alert in 30183 consisted of the integration of 3 transits occurring from
2021-06-06 to 2021-06-08

Here, we show flux measurements for each individual day.
The assumed spectrum is a power law with an index of -2.5 and
a pivot energy of 1 TeV.
Three days after the alert, we don't see any more flux increase.

Transits observed:
1: 2021-06-11 10:17:47 - 2021-06-11 16:42:41 UTC
2: 2021-06-10 10:21:42 - 2021-06-10 16:46:37 UTC
3: 2021-06-09 10:25:38 - 2021-06-09 16:50:33 UTC
4: 2021-06-08 10:29:33 - 2021-06-08 16:54:29 UTC
5: 2021-06-07 10:33:29 - 2021-06-07 16:58:25 UTC
6: 2021-06-06 10:37:24 - 2021-06-06 17:02:21 UTC

Position observed:
RA (J2000): 5.08[deg]
Dec (J2000): 31.14[deg]
Position uncertainty: 0.10[deg]
