GRB 050408: Optical afterglow confirmed

K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip, D. Kinoshita (NCU), Y. Urata, T. Tamagawa
(RIKEN), Y. Qiu (BAO) and Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of the East-Asia
GRB Follow-up Observation Network (EAFON)report:

" We have started the observation for the field of GRB 050408 at 17:10
UT on Apr 08 (55 min after the burst). Using Lulin-One meter Telescope
(LOT), we have performed 'VR broad band' filter imaging
observation. These images show a source in the Swift/XRT error
circle. The coordinate is consistent with that of A. de Ugarte Postigo
et al. (GCN 3193). Based on our preliminary 'VR-band' photometry, the
source shows variability which decay index is about -0.6 between
17:17(UT) and 18:33(UT). This source is therefore likely to be the
optical afterglow of GRB 050408. Further analysis is in progress.
