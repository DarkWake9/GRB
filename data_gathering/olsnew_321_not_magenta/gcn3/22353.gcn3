At 16:30:38.00 UT on January 12 2018, the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 180112A(Insight-HXMT internal trigger ID: HEB180112687 and HEB180112689, 
corresponding to two main pulses) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Swift/BAT and Integral/SPI-ACS and CALET/CGBM.

It's a pulsating GRB event. The Insight-HXMT light curve consists of 
two bursts triggered respectively at 16:30:38.00 UT and 16:32:56.00 UT, 
each of the two bursts consists of multiple pulses. The GRB event totally has a 
duration (T90) of 151.788 s measured from T0-5.2385 s. The 1s peak rate, 
measured from T0+139.541 s, is 1383.0 cnts/sec. The total counts from 
this GRB event is 4935.2 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
GRB mode with the energy range of about 200-3000 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
