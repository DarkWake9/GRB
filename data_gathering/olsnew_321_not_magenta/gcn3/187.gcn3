I. A. Smith (Rice University), R. P. J. Tilanus and F. Baas (Joint
Astronomy Centre) report on behalf of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(JCMT) GRB collaboration:
 
We used the SCUBA sub-millimeter continuum bolometer array on the JCMT to 
observe the variable radio source J034228.94+170914.6 in the error box of 
GRB 981220 (Galama et al. GCN #168, Frail et al. GCN #170).  The observation, 
performed in mediocre weather, started UT 1998 Dec 30.24 and lasted 3.8
hours.   No source was detected at this location: the 850 micron flux
density was 0.1 +/- 1.6 mJy.
