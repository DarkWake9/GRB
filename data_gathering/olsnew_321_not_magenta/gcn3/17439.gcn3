A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The long-duration, bright GRB 150210A has been detected by Fermi (GBM: 
Burns, GCN Circ. 17432; LAT: Zhu et al., GCN Circ. 17438), Konus-Wind, 
and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 80784 s UT (22:26:24).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   111.853 (07h 27m 25s) +13.832 (+13d 49' 54")
  Corners:
   111.458 (07h 25m 50s) +11.396 (+11d 23' 45")
   111.572 (07h 26m 17s) +16.337 (+16d 20' 13")
   112.332 (07h 29m 20s) +16.259 (+16d 15' 31")
   112.206 (07h 28m 49s) +11.314 (+11d 18' 52")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 3.6 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 5.1 deg (the minimum one is 44 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 148 deg.

The LAT (statistical-only) error circle (GCN 17438) overlaps the box. 
The distance between the center of the LAT position and the center of 
the error box is 0.63 deg.

This box may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming 
GCN Circular.
