We observed MASTER OT JJ015849.50-230853.7 originally reported in GCN #21499, on 2017-08-17 at 04:45UT using the SPRAT spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) we classify this transient as a SN Ia at around 13 days after peak, with a redshift of 0.035.

We also observed MASTER OT J030141.96-230037.8  on 2017-08-17 at 05:20UT. There is an extended object at these coordinates, but we detect no point source above the background level. The spectrum we obtained was featureless.
