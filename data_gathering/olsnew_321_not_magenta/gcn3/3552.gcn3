Localization Team report

A 60 s long GRB has been detected in IBIS/ISGRI data by IBAS (Alert 
Number 2587) at 03:45:16 UT. Its coordinates (J2000) are

RA: 186.7445 
DEC: -63.1342

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The preliminary peak flux is 0.4 ph (3E-8 erg) cmsq/s, while the fluence 
is 8.7E-7 erg/cmsq. Both values refer to the 20-200 keV band.

A preliminary spectral analysis shows that this event is X-ray rich.

A light curve will be posted at
