The HAWC collaboration reports:

On 2021/06/08, the Transient Online Maps All-Sky Search (TOMAS),
which performs a blind search on all the sky visible to HAWC, found a
significant event over an integration of 3 transits of the sky.

RA (J2000): 5.08[deg]
Dec (J2000): 31.14[deg]
Position uncertainty: 0.09[deg]

The pre-trial significance is 6.2 sigma, with an integrated flux of
(1.13Â±0.26)e-11 cm^-2s^-1 (> 1 TeV) for a power-law with index of -2.5.
The FAR is 1 every 1.25 years.

The times of the transits are:
2021-06-08 10:29:33 - 2021-06-08 16:54:29 UTC
2021-06-07 10:33:29 - 2021-06-07 16:58:25 UTC
2021-06-06 10:37:24 - 2021-06-06 17:02:21 UTC
With a total integration time of 19.25 hours.

The following known GeV gamma-ray sources are nearby:
4FGL J0014.9+3212
4FGL J0018.4+2946

HAWC is still monitoring the position and we will send updates.
Observations around the position are encouraged.
