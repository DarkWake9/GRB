B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (Toronto) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 17:19:20 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191001B (trigger=927345).  Swift did not slew due to
targets with higher priority.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 86.368, -15.907 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 45m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 54' 25"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several peaks
with a total duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~20 sec after the trigger. 

Due to higher priority observations, Swift will not slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no prompt XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (eleonora.troja AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
