TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB021004: optical observation

G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) reports:

Following the afterglow detection of this GRB (D.W. Fox et al.: GCN 1564; M.
Uemura et al.: GCN 1566), A. Tasselli (Mahlow, Germany) imaged, on Masi's
request, the field around the position given in GCN 1564. 36 CCD frames, each
with 45 seconds of integration, have been grabbed unfiltered with a 0.15m
telescope + CCD on Oct. 5.04375 UT, 2002,  and then coadded. The final image
clearly shows an object in very good agreement with the cited astrometry.

G. Masi performed the photometry of the source, using for calibration data from
A. Henden (GCN 1583). The resulting magnitude is 18.5 CR. This value fits well
with the data plotted by N. Mirabal et al. (GCN 1602).
