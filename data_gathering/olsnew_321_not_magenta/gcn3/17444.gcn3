WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150211A (Starling al.,
GCN 17434) starting at 11:54:12 UT, 121 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect any new source in our
images within the refined XRT error circle (Starling et al.,
GCN 17442). The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear
image is about 18.0 calibrated to USNO B1.0.
