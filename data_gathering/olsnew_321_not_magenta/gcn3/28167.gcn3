Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift trigger of GRB 200729A (Evans et al., GCNC 28165), the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, automatically responded to this burst. A given number of images were taken starting 19:39:29UT (84 s after trigger) during the twilight. In the co-adding of images taken later on, no source is detected which down to 19.6 mag (clear filter) at the XRT position, in the outskirts of the NGC 4242 galaxy. This is consistent with the non-detection reported by UVOT (Evans et al., GCNC 28165) and MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCNC 28166). Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA for their excellent support.
