K. Wiersema (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol (University of
Leicester) report:

We observed the position of GRB060906 (Racusin et al. GCN5528) with
the Danish 1.5m telescope at La Silla equipped with DFOSC.
Observations were done under high airmass, starting on
September 8 08:06 UT and ending at 08:52 UT. In the sum of 7 x 5 min
exposures in I band we do not detect the optical afterglow (Cenko et al.
GCN5529). Using a sample of 23 USNO-B stars we find a 3 sigma upper limit
of I = 21.95. The standard deviation in the zeropoint as determined
from the USNO stars is 0.24 mag.
