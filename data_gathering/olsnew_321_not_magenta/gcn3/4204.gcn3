report:

"We have observed the field of GRB 051105a (Cummings et al.,
GCN 4190, Barbier et al., GCN 4194) with 1.0m Nainital
telescope starting 8 hours after the GRB in the R-band
(4x5min) and with 1.5m OSN starting 12 and 36 hours after the
GRB in R (10x5min) and I (10x5min) bands. 

We inspected the complete BAT errorbox (Barbier et al., GCN
4194) and we do not detect any significantly decaying object.

Particularly we do not detect any variation among the three
sources reported by Klose et al. (GCN 4196) or of the optical
counterpart (Piranomonte et al., GCN 4201) of the radio source
reported by Frail et al. (GCN 4199)Â¨
