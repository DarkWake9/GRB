We observed the Swift GRB 110205A (Beardmore et al., GCN 11629)
with the Lightbuckets 0.61m rental telescope LB-0001 in Rodeo,
NM, USA. Under good weather conditions, two observations
were carried out in the Luminance and R filter starting
2011-02-05 at 07:45:58 UT (~ 5.7 hours after the GRB trigger)
and 09:39:21 UT (~7.6 hours after the GRB trigger). Another
followup observation was performed on R filter starting
2011-02-06 at 09:29:04 UT (~1.31 days after the trigger)
under acceptable weather conditions.

The burst afterglow is clearly detected in the first two
observations and estimated magnitudes are given below:

Time after trigger       Exposure (s)   Filter     Magnitude

5.7  hours (0.24 days)     1 x 300        Lum     19.0 +/- 0.1
7.6  hours (0.31 days)     1 x 300         R      19.6 +/- 0.2
31.4 hours (1.31 days)     2 x 300         R      > 20.1

The afterglow, not corrected for Galactic extinction, is
calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 catalog.

We acknowledge the helpful assistance of the Lightbuckets staff,
in particular Stephen G. Cullen.
