The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:11:52 UT on 18 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220518B (trigger 674586717.27941 / 220518717).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 293.3, Dec = -66.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 33m, -66d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 28.0 degrees.
