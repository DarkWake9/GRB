on behalf of the VAST collaboration.

Following Bannister et. al. (LVC GCN 21559) and Kaplan et al. (LVC GCN
21574),
we observed a second epoch of NGC 4993 with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array at 8.5 and 10.5 GHz. Observations started at 2017-08-20 23:31:02.9 UT
and ended at 2017-08-21 11:20:00 UT with approximately 13 minutes of
on-source
time.

We fit and subtracted a point-source at the optical position of NGC 4993
(13:09:47.71, -23:23:01.79; Skrutskie et al. 2003, 2MASS Extended Source
Catalog).
From this we set a 3-sigma upper limit of 135 uJy and 99 uJy on radio
emission
from SSS17a at 8.5 and 10.5 GHz respectively.

Subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
