J. P. Halpern, N. Mirabal (Columbia U.), & J. R. Thorstensen (Dartmouth)
report on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We observed the field of GRB 070129 (Godet et al., GCNs 6053, 6056) in
the I-band using the MDM 2.4m telescope on Jan. 30 from 02:14-02:43 UT,
or 2.65-3.14 hr after the burst.  The optical transient (OT) discovered
with the VLT at 2.15 hr post-burst (Malesani et al., GCNs 6055, 6070)
with R~21.3 is also present in our images, with magnitude I=20.60+/-0.04.
The latter is referenced to a star 27" west of the OT that has I=17.57
in the USNO B1.0 catalog.  An image is posted at
