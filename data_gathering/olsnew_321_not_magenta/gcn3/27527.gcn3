D. Svinkin, S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, D. Frederiks, A. Ridnaia,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN, and

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

A bright, short-duration, soft burst has been observed by
Fermi (GBM trigger 608204639) and Konus-Wind,
so far, at about 35034 s UT (09:43:54) on April 10.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=355.993 deg (23h 43m 58s) Dec(2000)=-0.325 deg (+0d 19' 31"),
whose radius is 64.478 +/- 0.078 deg (3 sigma).

This localization may be improved.

The position of SGR 1935+2154 is inside the annulus
at 4.2 arcmin from its center line.

Given the positional coincidence of this burst with SGR 1935+2154,
its time history, and softness of its spectrum (as observed by Konus-
Wind and Fermi-GBM), we conclude this burst is likely originated from
SGR 1935+2154.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
