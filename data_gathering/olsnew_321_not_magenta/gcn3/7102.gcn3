Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071117 (trigger #296805)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 7098).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 335.026, -63.442 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 20m 06.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 26' 31" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like peak starting
at ~T-0.5 sec, peaking at ~T+0.5 sec, and decaying away out to ~T+15 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.6 +- 1.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.4 to T+13.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 11.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
