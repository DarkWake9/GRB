In GCN 21508 we recently reported that the identification of IceCube neutrino candidates that are temporally and directionally coincident with LIGO/Virgo G298048.

A comparison of these neutrino candidates with Fermi GBM trigger 524666471/170817529 shows that one IceCube neutrino candidate is also *directionally* coincident with 90% CL of the Fermi GRB event. The coordinates of this reconstructed neutrino source are below:

#            dt[s]     RA[deg]    Dec[deg]      E[TeV]  Sigma[deg]
------------------------------------------------------------------
4.         -153.47       182.0        -3.2        0.88         0.9

(dt--time from GW in [seconds]; RA/Dec--sky location in [degrees]; E--reconstructed secondary muon energy in [TeV]; Sigma--uncertainty of direction reconstruction in [degrees])
