Using on-line data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported LIGO/Virgo S190513bm event using the 90% contour of the bayestar probability map provided by the GW interferometers (GCN#24522). The ANTARES visibility at the time of the alert, together with the 50% and 90% contours of the probability map are shown at https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/~dornic/events_runo3/S190513bm.png. Considering the location probability provided by the LIGO/Virgo collaborations, there is a 55% chance that the GW emitter was in the ANTARES **upgoing** field of view at the time of the alert. 

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded in the ANTARES sky during a +/- 500s time-window centered on the time (2019-05-13
20:54:28.747 UT) and in the 90% contour of the S190513 event. The expected number of atmospheric background events in the region visible by ANTARES is 1.7e-4 in the +/- 500s time window. An extended search during +/- 1 hour gives no up-going muon neutrino coincidence. The expected number of atmospheric background events in the region visible by ANTARES is 1.2e-3 in this larger time window.

ANTARES is the largest undersea neutrino detector, installed in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is primarily sensitive to neutrinos in the TeV-PeV  energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
