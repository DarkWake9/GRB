report on behalf of the FUN GRB collaboration:

Using griz all-sky photometry of a 4.8 arcmin x 4.8 arcminute field
centered on the coordinates of the optical afterglow of GRB 0505025a that
was derived from ARC 3.5-meter SPIcam observations made between 4:00 and
7:00 UT on 2005 June 13, we have calculated the griz magnitudes of 103
sources in the field of GRB 050525a:

The astrometry in these files is based on the USNO B1.0-catalogue. The
estimated systematic errors in the astrometry are less than 400mas.  The
estimated systematic photometric errors are typically ± 0.05 mag in the gri
bands and ± 0.06 mag in the z band.
