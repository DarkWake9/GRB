SUBJECT: GRB100508A: Further Swift/UVOT Observations
DATE:    10/05/10 13:38:18 GMT
FROM:    Wayne Landsman at GSFC/SSAI  <wayne.b.landsman@nasa.gov>

W.B. Landsman (GSFC) and R. Margutti (INAF-OAB)  report on behalf of 
the  Swift/UVOT team.

Swift/UVOT has continued observations of GRB100508A through 93,000s 
after the initial trigger (Margutti et al. GCN 10728).    The afterglow 
reported by Landsman and Margutti (GCN 10730)  was not detected in any 
filter past 12,000s after the initial trigger.     Magnitudes and 3 
sigma upper limits for selected exposures are reported below:

================================================


At late times our 3" photometry aperture includes the galaxy reported 
by  Schady et al. (GCN 10734), which may be the GRB host.   This galaxy 
is also listed in the SuperCosmos Sky Survey ( 
http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/docs.html ) with coordinates 2.1" distant 
from the UVOT position.   The late-time white magnitude in a 6491s 
summed exposure taken between 57097s and 93249s after the trigger within 
the 3" aperture used to measure the afterglow is 21.86 ± 0.12.

There are no detections or interesting magnitude limits in the UV filters.

The above magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction 
corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.029 (Schlegel et al., 1998, 
ApJS, 500, 525). There was a typo in the value of E(B-V) reported for 
this burst by Landsman & Margutti (GCN 10730).   The photometry is on 
the UVOT photometric system described in Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 
383, 627).
