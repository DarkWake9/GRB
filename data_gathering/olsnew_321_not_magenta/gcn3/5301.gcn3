the Swift Team:

At 21:07:43 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060712 (trigger=218582).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 184.061, +35.560 {12h 16m 15s, +35d 33' 35"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows very little structure
above background.  This is a 6.7-sigma detection in BAT spread over ~26 sec
so little is expected to be seen in the BAT lightcurve.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV). 

The XRT began taking data at 21:10:47 UT, 184 seconds after the BAT
trigger. The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in
the image and no prompt position is available. However analysis of the
downlinked Photon Counting mode data reveals a point source at the
following coordinates:  RA(J2000) = 12:16:16.3, Dec(J2000) = +35:32:17.7 
with an error radius of  4.2 arcseconds (90% confidence). This position 
is 81 arcseconds from the BAT position. 

UVOT was in an engineering mode, so no UVOT data are currently available.
