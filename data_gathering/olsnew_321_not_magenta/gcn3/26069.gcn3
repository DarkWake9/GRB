R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift GRB 191024A (Palmer et al., GCN 26063) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at Las Cumbres, Chile site, on October 24, from 05:18 to 05:23 UT (corresponding to 0.13 to 0.22 hours from the GRB trigger time) with Bessel R filter.

We performed a series of 2x120s exposures in R-band. We do not detect any sources in the Swift 90% confidence region (Evans et al., GCN 26064).  Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limit:


R > 17.08

These observations were possible thanks to the USVI NASA-EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Development (RID) grant NNX16AL44A.
