"At 05:49:39.62 UT on 15 Sept 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100915B (trigger 306222581 / 100915243)
which was also detected by INTEGRAL/IBIS (Mereghetti et al. 2010, GCN
11278). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL
position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 125 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one pulse
with a duration (T90) of 7.8 (+/- 0.7) s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5.6 s to T0+3.6 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is 1.35 (+1.63/- 1.10) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 83.49 (+ 14.50/-9.81) keV
(CSTAT 273 for 243 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.82 +/- 0.06)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-2.56 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.85 +/- 0.19 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
