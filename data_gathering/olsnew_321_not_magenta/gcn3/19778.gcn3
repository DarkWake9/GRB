and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160802A (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 19754;
Panasyuk et al., GCN Circ. 19759; Kozlova et al., GCN Circ. 19767)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 6:13:28.85 on
2 August 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two episodes.  The first episode
has a FRED-like structure with several pulses.  The emission starts
at T0 and ends at T+7 sec.  The second episode starts at T+17 sec,
peaks at T+18 sec and ends at T+22 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the
SGM data is 16.1 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
