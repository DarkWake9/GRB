B. A. Zauderer, E. Berger, T. Laskar (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration
as part of the CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient
Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 130925A (Lien et al., GCN 15246) with the
Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) beginning
2013 Sep 26.36 (dt = 1.19 d) at a mean frequency of 93 GHz.  Observations
were
conducted in the compact E configuration, with significant flagging for
shadowed
antennas required.  We do not detect any significant radio emission to a
3-sigma
limit of 0.6 mJy at the position of the Swift-XRT position (Evans et al.,
GCN 15251).

We thank the CARMA observers and staff for prompt execution of these
observations."
