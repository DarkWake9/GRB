D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Konus and RHESSI observed this GRB at 51053 seconds.  As observed by
Konus, it had a duration of about 200 ms.  We have triangulated it
to an annulus centered at RA, Decl. (2000)=51.987, 22.172 degrees, whose
radius is 40.506 +/- 2.948 degrees (3 sigma).  As this annulus does not
include any of the known soft gamma repeaters, this is probably a short/hard
GRB.

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was not 
observed by Ulysses or Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
