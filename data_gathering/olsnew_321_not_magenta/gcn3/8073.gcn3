A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) and C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC) report:

"We observed the position of the GRB 080804 afterglow at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at August 5 16.92 UT to 22.45
UT, i.e. 0.73 - 0.96 days after the burst (GCN 8057).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical afterglow
(GCN 8056). The formal flux measurement for a point source at the location
of the optical counterpart is -41 +/- 64 microJy at 4.8 GHz, and 40 +/- 63
microJy at 8.6 GHz.

We would like to thank the staff of the Australia Telescope National
Facility, in particular Angel Lopez-Sanchez and Philip Edwards, for
scheduling and obtaining these Target of Opportunity observations."
