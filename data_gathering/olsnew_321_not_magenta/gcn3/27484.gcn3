The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:04:03 UT on 3 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200403B (trigger 607644248.41943 / 200403919).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 239.9, Dec = 73.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 59m, 73d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 36.0 degrees.
