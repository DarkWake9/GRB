WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150314A (Hagen et al.,
GCN 17573) starting at 04:57:32 UT, 136 s after the burst. We
detect a fading source at position
RA=  08:26:40.96 (J2000)
DEC= 63:50:03.20 (J2000)
which faded from mag R~16.0 to R~17.5 in a time interval of about 10
minutes. We suggest this to be the optical afterglow of GRB 150314A.
However, we note that this position is about 11 arcsecond, a bit far
away from XRT position, indicating this might be unrelated source.
Observations are on going.
