P. D'Avanzo, D. Fugazza (INAF/OAB) L. Di Fabrizio, G. Mainella (INAF/TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 140414A (Cummings, GCN 16110) using the DOLORES camera on the 3.6-m TNG Telescope at Canary Islands.

We obtained 30 minutes of imaging observations under seeing of ~ 2" with the r SDSS filter at a mean t-t0 of 15.2 hours. No object brighter than the SDSS limit is found inside the BAT error circle (Cummings, GCN 16111). The 3sigma limiting magnitude of the co-added image is r~22 (calibrated against SDSS stars).


We thank the TNG visiting astronomer Luca Malavolta.
