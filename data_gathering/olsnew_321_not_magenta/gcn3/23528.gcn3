TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 181213A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    18/12/13 14:07:01 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), G.
Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), S. Campana (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 181213A at 13:36:41.2 UT,
2342.8 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 248.27284,
78.49726 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 16h 33m 05.48s
   Dec(J2000) = +78d 29' 50.1"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 53 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 4.49
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
