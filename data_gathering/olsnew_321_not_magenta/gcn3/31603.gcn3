SUBJECT: Swift resumes pointed science observations

At 17:15 UT on 17 February 2022, Swift resumed pointed observations of pre-planned science targets with the attitude control system operating with five reaction wheels. Preliminary analysis of data from the spacecraft, as well as all three on-board instruments, are consistent with expected performance.

As we gain familiarity with slew performance in the new configuration, the team will work to re-enable autonomous response to on-board gamma-ray burst triggers, as well as uplinks of rapid-response target-of-opportunity (ToO) requests. Both capabilities will be re-enabled no earlier than next week.

In the mean time, we have reopened the target-of-opportunity website to accept observation requests from the community. As rapid-response ToO uplinks are not currently enabled, only requests with medium urgency or below (i.e., response time ~ days) are currently enabled. Please note that due to the President’s Day holiday in the US, the earliest time new requests can be accommodated in the schedule is Wednesday, 23 February.
