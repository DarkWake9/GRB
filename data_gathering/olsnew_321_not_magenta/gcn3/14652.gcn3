We observed the field of GRB 130511A (Krimm et al., GCN 14620) using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3m. Three 900s integration at resolution R=3000, covering 540 - 950nm, were obtained starting at 2013-05-11 12:03 UTC, ~32 minutes after the Swift trigger.

Spectral photometry of the sky-subtracted data cube was carried out in a 6" diameter aperture. Compared to a nearby field star, we measure the optical afterglow to be at r ~ 20.2 and i ~ 20.1 at a mean time of ~ 1 hr after the burst.
We thank Tiantian Yuan, Fred Vogt and Rebecca Davis for performing this observation.
