G. Olofsson (Stockholm), Johan P. U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), and P. Jakobsson 
(Univ. Iceland) report:

We observed the field of GRB 081028 (Guidorzi et al., GCN 8421) with the 
NOT equipped with PolCor. Observations started on 2008 Oct 28, around 6 
UT (more accurate information will follow).

At a position consistent with the X-ray error circle, we detect a bright 
object at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 08:07:34.721
Dec(J2000) = +02:18:29.03

Given the small field of view, only four stars are available for 
astrometry. Assuming R = 15.7 for the USNO star at RA=08:07:33.70, Dec = 
+02:18:39.9, we compute R ~ 19.2 for the afterglow.

Our astrometry and photometry are consistent with those reported by 
Clemens et al. (GCN 8424). The object is not visible in the DSS nor in 
the SDSS, hence we are confident it is the afterglow of GRB 081028.

A finding chart is available on request.
