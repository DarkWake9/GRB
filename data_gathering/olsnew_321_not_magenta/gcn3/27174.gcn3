The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:05:49 UT on 24 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200224A (trigger 604213554.278888 / 200224212).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 177.9, Dec = -28.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 51m, -28d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 23.0 degrees.

[GCN OPS NOTE(24feb20): This is the third Circular in the sequence of 8 circulars
which were all labeled A because of the sequence assigner being offline.
This circular was orginally, incorrectly labelled A, but the true letter identity is B.]
