H.L. Xiao (PSI) , W. Hajdas (PSI) and R. Marcinkowski (PSI)   report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:
At 2017-01-14 22:01:10.0 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, POLAR detected GRB 170114A,
which was also observed by Fermi GBM (trigger #506124074) .

The POLAR light curve consists of one peak with duration (T90) of 8.0 +/- 0.5 s measured from T0.
The 0.5 s peak flux at T0 + 2.8 s  is equal to 7660 +/- 120 counts/sec.
POLAR recorded 26800 events from the burst.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 80 - 500 keV.

Using the best location from Fermi GBM, which is (J2000):
RA : 12.1 [deg]
Dec: -12.6 [deg]
the incident angle in the POLAR coordinate at T0 is:
Theta: 26.4 [deg]
Phi: 4.9 [deg]

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Calibration of the instrument is ongoing.
POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which was launched on-board the Chinese space
laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
