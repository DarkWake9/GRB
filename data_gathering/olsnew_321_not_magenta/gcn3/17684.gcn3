D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) and P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 150407A (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 17682),
collecting 2.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+68.5 ks
and T0+70.5 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field ranges from ~0.004
to ~0.009 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
1.4e-13 to 3.8e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020487.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
