In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190521g at T0 = 2019-05-21 03:02:29
(UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered
data found no event candidates within a time interval covering 100 sec
preceding the LIGO-Virgo T0. Later times were not covered by MCAL exposure
because of SAA interruption, until about + 800 sec from T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S190521g 90% c.l.
localization region (almost 60% of the given GW contour), from a minimum of
2.08E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 8.31E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral
model a single power law with photon index 1.5). The average off-axis angle
is about 60 degrees.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in
progress.
