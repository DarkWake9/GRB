E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), W. Rujopakarn (U Mich), report on behalf of the 
ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded 
to GRB 061007 (Swift trigger 232683). The first image was at 10:08:35.2 
UT, 26.4 s after the burst (9.2 s after the GCN notice time). The 
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a new 
object, not visible in the DSS (second epoch), with coordinates:

      03:05:19.6      -50:30:02.5    (J2000), with positional 
uncertainty of 1" or better

marked 13 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
