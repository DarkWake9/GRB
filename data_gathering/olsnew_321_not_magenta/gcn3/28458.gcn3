Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200919A
(trigger #996503) (Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 28454).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 168.899, 32.456 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 15m 35.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +32d 27' 21.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 62%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses
that start at ~T-60 s and end at ~T+25 s. The main peak
occurs at ~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 76.0 +- 6.9 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-61.47 to T+24.54 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.13 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+4.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
