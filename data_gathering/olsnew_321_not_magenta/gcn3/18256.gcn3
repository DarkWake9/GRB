Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150907B (trigger #654803)
(Roegiers, et al., GCN Circ. 18249).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 255.265, -63.798 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 01m 03.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 47' 51.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a Fred-like starting at ~T-1 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending around T+100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 62.0 +- 11.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.48 to T+64.53 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.17 +- 1.03, 
and Epeak of 67.4 +- 29.7 keV (chi squared 53.2 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+0.59 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.47 +- 0.18 (chi squared 59.8 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
