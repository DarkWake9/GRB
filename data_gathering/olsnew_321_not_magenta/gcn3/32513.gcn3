Following the report of the Swift/BAT/GUANO GRB 220831A (Tohuvavohu et 
al., GCN 32506; see also Wood & Meegan, GCN 32511) we observed the BAT 
error circle with the ESO Very Large Telescope, equipped with the HAWK-I 
near-infrared camera. Observations consisted in 20 min exposure in the J 
band, with a mean time of 19.4 hr after the GRB.

Lacking a deep reference image to check for variability, no claim of a 
new object can be made based solely on our data. Within the BAT error 
circle, several objects are apparent in the HAWK-I image which are not 
visible in the the Legacy survey (z and r bands), which are likely due 
to color effects.

A source is visible in the HAWK-I image which is consistent with the 
weak X-ray source reported by Dichiara et al. (GCN 32510), at 
coordinates (J2000):

RA = 01:37:00.95
Dec = -41:35:34.37

Its Vega magnitude is J = 21.9 +- 0.09, calibrated against one 2MASS 
star, and is not detected in the Legacy survey down to limiting 
magnitudes z > 23.1, r > 24 (all AB).


We also note the presence of the nearby galaxy NGC 625, with a NED 
distance ~4 Mpc, which is 23.6 arcmin (~30 kpc in projection) away from 
the BAT coordinates of GRB 220831A.

We acknowledge the support of the observing staff at Paranal. Further 
observations are planned.
