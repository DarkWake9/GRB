The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:39:37 UT on 2 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200402A (trigger 607513182.90837 / 200402403).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 50.5, Dec = 42.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 22m, 42d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
