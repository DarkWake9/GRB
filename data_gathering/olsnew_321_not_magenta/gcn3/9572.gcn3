D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), A. Neronov, 
V.Beckmann, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A long GRB with duration of about 11 s has been detected by IBAS in 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:26:21 UT on June 25th.

The refined coordinates (J2000)  are:

 RA:    2.2626 [degrees]
 DEC: -65.7816 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of  
about 2 ph/cmq/s (1 s integration time) and a fluence over the same energy
range of about  1.5e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
