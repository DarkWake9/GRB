Hurkett, J. P. Osborne, K. L. Page, M. R. Goad, A. A. Wells (U. Leicester), 
W. Voges (MPE), and N. Gehrels (GSFC)  report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050701 at 11:42:59 UT on 01 July 2005 
(Boyd et al. 2005, GCN 3556).  The BAT instrument incorrectly classified 
this as a known source in the on-board catalog and the observatory did not 
make an automated slew.  A ToO observation was uploaded at about 13:00 
UT.  The spacecraft slewed to the target and XRT began taking data in 
Manual State/PC mode at about 13:19:05 (5766 s post-burst).  Based on XRT 
quick-look data products at the MOC, we find a faint uncataloged X-ray 
source located at:

RA(J2000) = 15:09:01.9,
Dec(J2000) = -59:24:56.3.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds radius (90% 
containment).   This source is located 55 arcseconds from the BAT position 
in GCN 3556.  Further XRT results will be released as the standard pipeline 
data products are analyzed.
