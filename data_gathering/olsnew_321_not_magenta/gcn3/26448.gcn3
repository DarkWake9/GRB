on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S191215w at T0 = 2019-12-15
22:30:52.333 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0
shows that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less
than 10% of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR) (35% of 90% c.l. LR
is occulted by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV over time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of
the S191215w 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

from 2.0e-07 to 9.4e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 45% of
the LR over the time interval ( T0 + 100s ; T0 + 200s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion
of the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in
progress.
