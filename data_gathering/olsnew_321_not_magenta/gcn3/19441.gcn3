Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160519A (trigger #686818)
(D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 19436).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 71.122, 31.246 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  04h 44m 29.2s
  Dec(J2000) = +31d 14' 46.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 19%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that starts
at ~ T-1 s, peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+3 s. There are some weak emissions
extend till ~T+40 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 35.57 +- 6.11 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.99 to T+41.12 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.95 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.4 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
