Guziy (Univ. of Nikolaev) and D. R. Xiong, Y. F. Fan, J. M. Bai, C. J. Wang, Y. X. Xin, X. H. Zhao (Yunnan Observatories of CAS) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 210212A by Swift (Troja et al. GCNC 29487), the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang Astronomical Observatory (China) started to gather images after the twilight as soon as it was possible. No new source is detected within the Swift/XRT enhanced position (Beardmore et al. GCNC 29489) down to 19.7 mag in the co-added images (5x60 s, clear filer) starting at 13:11 UT on Feb 12. The non-detection is consistent with the limit reported by Swift/UVOT (Troja et al. GCNC 29487).

We thank the staff at Lijiang observatory for their excellent support.
