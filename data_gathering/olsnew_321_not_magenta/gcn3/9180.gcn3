Brajesh Kumar, Rupak Roy, Brijesh Kumar and S. B. Pandey (ARIES, NainiTal,
India, on behalf
of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

We observed swift GRB 090417B (GCN 9135) using 104 cm Sampurnanand optical
telescope
at A.R.I.E.S. Nainital on 17th April, 2009 at 16.244 hrs UT, under good sky
conditions using
2k*2k CCD detector.

No afterglow candidate was found in our co-added R_c band image (exp time =
5*300 sec)
within the error region of BAT. Photometry of the stacked frame poses an
upper limit of
~ 21 mag, in comparison to nearby USNO-B1 stars.
