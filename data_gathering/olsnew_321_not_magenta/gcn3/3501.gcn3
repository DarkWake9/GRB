The putative Swift-BAT burst GRB050528 (Trigger 130679 at 04:06:45 UT)
(GCN 3496) is still uncertain.  Intermittant problems with the transfer
of data from Malindi to the US have prevented a final determination
of the validity of this BAT trigger.  The file transfer problem
is being worked, and when we get the data from the trigger time interval,
we will issue an update.  We apologize for the delay and any inconvenience
in follow-up observing programs.
