T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 04:09:17 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080325 (trigger=307604).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 277.895, +36.511 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 31m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 30' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  Because this is a 64-sec long image trigger, the
TDRSS lightcurve does not show any significant signal (as is typical). 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:11:49.2 UT, 151.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 277.8920, +36.5221 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 31m 34.0s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 31' 19.5"
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 40 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to assess possible
redshift constraints using X-ray spectroscopy and the nH-z relation
from Grupe et al. (2007). 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 162 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. Image catalog data are not available
at this time. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board
covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete
to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.06. 




Burst Advocate for this burst is L. Vetere (vetere AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
