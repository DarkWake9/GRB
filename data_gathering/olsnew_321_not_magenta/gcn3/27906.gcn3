Observatory Team:

At 17:28:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200608A (trigger=976692).  Swift did not slew due to an
observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 309.629, -31.168 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 38m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = -31d 10' 05"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 90 sec. However, we can not rule out
the possibility that some of these variations are from other sources in 
the field of view until further ground analysis. The peak count rate
was ~400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~20 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 01:24 UT on 2020 June 11. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. J. Moss (mikejmoss3 AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
