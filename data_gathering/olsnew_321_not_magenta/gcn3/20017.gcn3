Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161007A (trigger #716127)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 20008).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 103.408, 23.289 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  06h 53m 37.9s
    Dec(J2000) = +23d 17' 18.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 87%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a peak starting from T+20 sec,
peaking at T+40 sec and ending at T+100 sec.  There is a hint of an
extended emission up to T+250 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 201.7 +- 40.3 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+18.2 to T+105.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.46 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+33.81 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
