Continuing the analysis for BAT GRB 090417B (trigger #349450)
(Cummings, GCN Circ 9139) using more downlinked data, we report that
this burst is very long.  The revised mask-weighted light curve
starts before T-200 sec (where we start collecting event data
on each trigger), slowly rises to a peak around T+400 sec
and slowly decreases to a minumum around T+1100 sec, then increases
to a second maximum around T+1650 sec, and then decreases again
with continuing emission past T+2100 sec (where the data stops).
The amplitudes of the two peaks are 0.09 +- 0.01 and 0.060 +- 0.006
ph/cm2/sec, resp.
