on behalf of the Swift BAT team:

GRB 041223 (Tueller et al., GCN #2898) was a spectrally hard burst.
Fits to the total Swift-BAT burst spectrum are consistent with a power
law, with a photon index of 1.05-1.15.

The BAT team did not quote a total band fluence in GCN 2898, due to
uncertainty in the response at high energies.  Now, with further
simulations and spectral analysis, we estimate that the 15-350 keV
fluence was ~5E-5 erg/cm^2.  The peak flux was 3E-6 erg/cm^2/s (15-350
keV; 1 s sampling), which is dominated by the highest energy band.
