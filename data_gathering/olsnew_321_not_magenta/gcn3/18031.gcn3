P. Romano (INAF-IASFPA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

We conclude that Swift trigger 649143 (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 18025) was 
the result of noise fluctuations and is not due to AX J1619.4-4945 or other 
astrophysical event.

We have analyzed the BAT data set from T-119 to T+148 sec from the recent 
telemetry downlink.  We find that there is no sign of significant emission from 
the trigger location at any point in this interval.

XRT observations with 471 seconds of data show a detection of 
AX J1619.4-4945 at 0.05 c/s, which is consistent with the quiescent flux level 
of this source.
