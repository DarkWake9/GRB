Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210514A (trigger #1048372)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 30009).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 2.947, -21.898 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  00h 11m 47.2s 
  Dec(J2000) = -21d 53' 54.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 79%.

The mask-weighted light curve showed a complex structure of five main peaks
with sub-peaks.  Emission started around T-1 sec and continued to T+75 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 70.21 +- 0.74 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.08 to T+75.13 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.65 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 8.7 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
