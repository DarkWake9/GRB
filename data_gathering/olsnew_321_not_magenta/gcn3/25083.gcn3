MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)  located in South Africa (South African Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB190718.2 (trigger No 915091, 22h 26m 07.44s , -41d 13m 15.60s, R=0.05) errorbox  18 sec after notice time and 44 sec after trigger time at 2019-07-18 04:41:59 UT, with upper limit up to  17.0 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenit distance = 40 deg. The sun  altitude  is -11.6 deg. 

MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope  located in Argentina (OAFA observatory of San Juan National University) was pointed to the Swift GRB190718.2 errorbox  32 sec after notice time and 57 sec after trigger time at 2019-07-18 04:42:12 UT, with upper limit up to  17.1 mag. The observations began at zenit distance = 33 deg. The sun  altitude  is -80.1 deg. 

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB190718.2 errorbox  55 sec after notice time and 80 sec after trigger time at 2019-07-18 04:42:35 UT, with upper limit up to  16.8 mag. The observations began at zenit distance = 71 deg. The sun  altitude  is -18.8 deg. 

The galactic latitude b = -60 deg., longitude l = 98 deg.
