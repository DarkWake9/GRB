A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, ISA-UMA), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC, UPV-EHU),
J. C. Tello, R. Cunniffe, A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez, A. Sota, M. Jelinek, S.
Jeong, O. Lara-Gil, S. R. Oates, R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC, Granada), P.
Kubanek (IP-ASCR, Prague), S. Pandey (ARIES),  and A. Garcia (GTC,IAC) report:

The field of GRB 140709A (Hagen et al. GCNC  16546) was observed in i'-band
with  the 10.4m GTC telescope in two epochs centered on July 9.12955 and
10.10966 UT (1.9 and 25.4 hours post burst). Comparison between those two
epochs reveals that the optical candidate reported by Castro-Tirado et al.
(GCNC 16554) has faded by ~0.7 mags (from i'~21.3 to 22.0, both in AB),
implying a shallow decay index of ~0.2.  A similar decay is measured in
z'-band.
