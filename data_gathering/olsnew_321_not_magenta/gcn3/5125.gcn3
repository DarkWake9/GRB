S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  Observations consisted of 5 x 150 s
exposures taken in the Kron R band.  The mean epoch of our observations
was approximately 03:50 13 May 2006 UT (~ 4.6 hrs after the burst).  We
clearly detect the afterglow and measure an R-band magnitude of R ~ 20.1
(calculated with respect to the USNO-B catalog).

Comparing with the early afterglow detection reported by Mundell and
Steele (GCN 5119), we measure a decay index of alpha ~ 1.0.  We note this
is slightly steeper than the value reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 5122),
although not significant enough to claim a break in the light curve.

Further observations are underway.
