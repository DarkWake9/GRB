NUMBER:  2640
SUBJECT: GRB 040812: a long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    04/08/12 06:52:50 GMT

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, M. Beck, J.Borkowsk
(ISDC) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A 20 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on August 12 at 06:01:50 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band (IBAS Alert # 1901)
Its coordinates (J2000)  are:

R.A. 16h 26m 05s
Dec. -44deg 42' 32''

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin  (90% c.l. radius)

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 0.6
photons/cmsq/s (5E-8 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).

A preliminary spectral analysis inidcates that this event is X-ray rich.
