A.J. Levan (Radboud Univ), M. Fraser (UCD), P. Jonker (SRON/Radboud Univ), D. Steeghs (Warwick), D.B. Malesani (DTU Space), L. Salmon, K. Maguire (UCD),  D. Perley, C. Copperwheat (LJMU), P. D’Avanzo (INAF) report for a larger collaboration:

We observed 17 galaxies within the 90% error volume of S190814bv (LVC GCN 25324) with the William Herschel Telescope, in co-ordination with several other telescopes on La Palma (Heintz et al. GCN 25325, Perley et al. GCN 25328, D’Avanzo et al. GCN 25331). Observations were obtained on 15 August 2019 between 03:28 and 04:49 UT.  Galaxies were selected from the HOGWARTS code (https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie/)). For each galaxy we obtained 3x60s r-band observations in good seeing. Comparison with archival Pan-STARRS imaging reveals no obvious counterparts in any cases to similar limiting magnitudes to the Pan-STARRS images, although we caution that fainter candidates close to their hosts could be omitted in such an inspection.

The locations of the galaxies observed are
