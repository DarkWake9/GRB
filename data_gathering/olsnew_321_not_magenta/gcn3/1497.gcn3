report:
 
The afterglow of GRB 020813 (Fox et al., GCN 1470) was observed 
at 250 GHz (1.2 mm) with the 37 channel Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer
(MAMBO) array (80 GHz bandwidth, 10.7 arcsec HPBW) at the IRAM 30 m
telescope on Pico Veleta (Spain), at the position reported by Rhoads
et al. (GCN 1474). 

The observation dates, average elevations, 250 GHz zenith opacities,
on-sky integration time, and (1/rms^2 weighted) average flux densities
are listed in the following table:

date    UT           EL   tau_z  t_int  flux [mJy]
-----------------------------------------------------
Aug 13, 19:10-21:10  32d   0.50  2950s  1.45 +-1.15
Aug 14, 23:10-23:55  31d   0.39  1260s  1.08 +-1.39

                         total:  4210s  1.30 +-0.89

Given the high line of sight opacity we were not able to detect
the GRB afterglow at sufficient significance.
Our flux density limits are consistent with those found by Bremer
et al. (GCN 1487) at 232 GHz, -0.63 +-2.06 mJy.
