TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1772

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

D.Gotz (IASF-Milano), P.Favre (ISDC), S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano),
J. Borkowski (ISDC), and the INTEGRAL Science Working team,
report:

The IPN  annulus actually intersects the INTEGRAL error circle given in
GCN 1768 at four points, not two:

          RA                               DEC
     282.572616=18 h 50 m 17 s      31.849899= 31 o  50 '  59 "
     282.664692=18 h 50 m 39 s      31.957916= 31 o  57 '  28 "
     282.546093=18 h 50 m 11 s      31.898856= 31 o  53 '  55 "
     282.601577=18 h 50 m 24 s      31.963983= 31 o  57 '  50 "

Thus the agreement between the annulus and the error circle is
improved, but the error box size increases to about 22 square
arcminutes.  A revised map has been posted at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/021219.
