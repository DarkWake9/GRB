S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB090518 (Evans et al., GCN 9386) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope beginning at 3:45 UT on 2009 May 18 (~
1.83 hr after the burst).  Observations were taken in the r', i', and z'
filters at high airmass.  We find no sources inside the enhanced XRT
error circle (Evans et al., GCN 9387), to the following limiting
magnitudes:

Filter     Magnitude
--------------------------------
r'         > 20.5
i'         > 20.0
z'         > 19.0

No correction has been applied for Galactic extinction along the line of
sight.
