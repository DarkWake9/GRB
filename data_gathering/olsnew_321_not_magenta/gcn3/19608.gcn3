The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160601A (Kocevski et al., GCN 19478) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jun 01.78, Jun 02.95, Jun 
04.95, and Jun 11.95 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Evans et al., GCN 19484), with 3sigma upper limits of 282 uJy, 
216 uJy, 108 uJy, and 132 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
