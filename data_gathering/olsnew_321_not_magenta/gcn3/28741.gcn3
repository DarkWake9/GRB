We observed the field of GRB 201014A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 28623, D'Elia 
et al., GCN 28626) with the Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph and 
Camera (HFOSC) mounted on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (IAO, 
Hanle). Three frames (each 300 sec) of the GRB field were obtained in 
the Bessell R-band in the average sky conditions. Preliminary PSF 
photometry on the stacked image was performed and calibrated against 
USNO-B1 catalogue stars. We do not detect any OT candidate (Pozanenko et 
al., GCN 28628, de Ugarte Postigo et al, GCN 28650, Dichiara et al. 
28654, Zhu et al, GCN 28655, Laskar et al. 28685, Kumar et al. 28689, 
Moskvitin et al. 28699) within the enhanced XRT position (Perri et al., 
GCN 28638).

The upper limit in the stacked image is the following:

DATE           UT    Filter Exposure(sec)  Frames  Upper limit (mag)
2020-10-15  15:55:29    R        300         3          21.7

We thank the staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the observations.
