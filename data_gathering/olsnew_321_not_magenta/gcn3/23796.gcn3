V. D'Elia (SSDC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and K. L. Page (U Leicester)
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 12:09:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located MAXI J1348-630 (trigger=885845).  Swift was already observing 
this position from the previous trigger 885807 (GCN 23795)
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 207.004, -63.270 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 48m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 16' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is normal for an image trigger, the 
light-curve showed no significant structure.
