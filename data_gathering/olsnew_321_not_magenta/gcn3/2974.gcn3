The Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) was pointed at GRB050124 ( GCN 2972, Markwardt
et al.; GCN 2973, Cummings et al.) on 2005/01/24 at 14:34 UT.  The spacecraft
did not autonomously slew to the burst since automated slewing was not enabled
at the time the burst occurred.  The observation was performed as a Target of
Opportunity beginning about 3 hours after the burst.  The first XRT exposure
was at 14:35:16 UT.  The observation continued until 15:17:12 UT.  The XRT was
in Auto State and the ToO was performed as if it were an automated burst
observation.  XRT attempted to determine a prompt centroid but found
insufficient counts.  It took one frame in Piled-up Photodiode mode, one in
Low-rate Photodiode mode, and then settled into Windowed Timing mode (1-D
position resolution, 2 ms timing) for the bulk of the observation (1100
frames), with about 220 frames in Photon-Counting mode (2-D position
resolution, 2.5s timing).

We processed the data on the ground and detect a bright X-ray source in this
field.  The X-ray centroid has an approximate location of:
RA(J2000) = 12:51:31.1
Dec(J2000) = 13:02:34.3.

This position is not corrected for stellar aberration, and we estimate an
uncertainty of about 30 arcseconds as a result.  A more accurate position will
be available once the data are processed by the XRT pipeline software.

Checks against SIMBAD and the HEASARC master X-ray catalog yielded no known
source at this position on the sky.   The XRT position is about 70 arcseconds
from the refined BAT positions (GCN 2973).

We have a total of about 600 counts from this object in the first observation
set.  The spectrum appears consistent with a power-law, but detailed fitting
awaits the pipeline-processed data.  Additional automated observations are in
progress when the afterglow field is observable by Swift.
