D. Svinkin, S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, D. Frederiks, A. Ridnaia,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN, and

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

The short-duration GRB 200313B
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 27379)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 605789837) and Konus-Wind, so 
far, at about 39432 s UT (10:57:12).

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=154.610 deg (10h 18m 26s) Dec(2000)=+8.761 deg (+8d 45' 41"),
whose radius is 60.602 +/- 2.419 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi-GBM one.

This localization may be improved.
