The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:29:49 UT on 21 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201121A (trigger 627614994.006474 / 201121062).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 210.8, Dec = -27.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 03m, -27d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 77.0 degrees.
