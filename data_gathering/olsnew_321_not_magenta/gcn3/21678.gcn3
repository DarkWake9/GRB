Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170823A (trigger #769177)
(Troja et al., GCN Circ. 21666).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 188.713, 35.549 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 34m 51.1s
  Dec(J2000) = +35d 32' 58.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 79%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked light curve that starts at
~ T0 and ends at ~T+90 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 69.4 +- 11.7 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.36 to T+87.31 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.06 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.6 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+21.40 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
