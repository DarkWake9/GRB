The long GRB 190103B (Swift-BAT trigger #881709: Lien et al.,
GCN Circ. 23602, Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 23606;
Konus-Wind observation: Tsvetkova et al., GCN Circ. 23612)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 21:03:46.478 UTC on 3 January 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows two multi-peaked pulses which
start at T-6.9 sec, peak at T+5.4 sec, and end at T+22.3 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
19.6 +- 2.5 sec and 9.1 +- 1.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
