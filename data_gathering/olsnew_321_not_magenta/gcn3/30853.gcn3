The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 15:39:51 UT on 19 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210919B (trigger 653758796.95736 / 210919653).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 215.2, Dec = -77.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 20m, -77d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53.0 degrees.
