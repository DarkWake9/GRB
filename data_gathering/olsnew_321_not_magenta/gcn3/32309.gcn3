We observed GRB 220701A (Evans et al. GCN 32306) with the Large
Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT).
Observations began on July 1, 2022 at 08:01:14 UT in r-band (~3.1 hr
after the GRB) for a total exposure of 1000 s at airmass 1.3 and
seeing 1.2". Within the XRT enhanced position (Evans et al. GCN 32308)
we do not detect a source to depth r > 24.3 AB mag.

Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and are not corrected
for Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance
with these observations.
