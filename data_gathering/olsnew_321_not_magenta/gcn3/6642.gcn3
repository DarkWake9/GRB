Using the data set from T-239 to T+352 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070721A (trigger #285653)
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN Circ. 6639).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 3.144, -28.530 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =   0h 12m 34.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -28d 31' 47" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 72%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve has a single peak starting at ~T-4 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+8 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
3.4 +- 0.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+3.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.46 +- 0.41.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.1 +- 1.8 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.12 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 
 
We note that the fluence ratio in a simple power-law fit between the
25-50 keV band and the 50-100 keV band is 1.38.  This fluence ratio is larger
than 1.32 which can be achieved in the Band function of alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.5,
and Epeak=30 keV.  Thus, preliminary analysis shows that Epeak of the burst
is very likely around or below 30 keV.  Therefore the burst can be classified
as an X-ray flash.
