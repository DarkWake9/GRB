Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We continued to monitor the XRT error box of
GRB 061028 defined Sakamoto et al. (GCNC 5762)
with TAROT. Early observations (Klotz et al.
GCNC 5763) did not shown any OT in this area.

Under excellent weather conditions, we can
now give the following upper limit derived
from a series of co-added 180s images images:

from t0+0.44 to t0+1.07 hour : R>20.1

where t0 is the BAT trigger date.
