SUBJECT: GRB010214, field photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired preliminary BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
the field of GRB010214 with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one
photometric night with poor seeing.  This 11x11arcmin field includes
the proposed counterpart and extends to approximately V=20.
All stars brighter than V=14 are saturated and should be used
with care.  We have placed the photometric data on our
anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb010214.dat
The current photometry has a potential external zero-point
error of about two percent that needs to be added in
quadrature to the Poisson errors given in the datafile.
The astrometry in this file is based on linear
plate solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0. The internal errors
are less than 100mas.

At least two additional nights of photometry will be added to the data
file when weather conditions permit.
