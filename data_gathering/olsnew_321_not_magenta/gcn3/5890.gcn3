T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The short hard GRB 061201 (Swift-BAT trigger #241840;
Marshall et al., GCN 5881; Markwardt et al., GCN 5882)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=57514.558 s UT (15:58:34.558).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~0.6 s,
fluence 5.33(-4.44, +0.70)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.528
3.19(-2.72, +0.72)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 3 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 0.36(-0.65, +0.40)
and Ep = 873(-284, +458) keV (chi2 = 79/67 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
