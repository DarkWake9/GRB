GWFUNC collaboration:

We observed the localization regions of the LIGO/Virgo gravitational 
wave trigger S191216ap (GCN #26454), the IceCube neutrino counterpart 
candidate (GCN #26460), and the HAWC gamma-ray counterpart candidate 
(GCN #26472), using the Nanshan 1-meter telescope with the FOV of 
1.3x1.3 deg^2. Observations started at 11:57:05 UT and ended at 15:19:31 
UT on 2019-12-17.

Our survey area covers No.1 (ra: 323.124298, dec: 5.346313) and No.4 
(ra: 323.298126, dec: 4.682521) GLADE galaxies, reported in Kumar et al. 
(GCN #26476). No 1. galaxy has m(r) ~ 15.67 mag in our image, being 
consistent with m(r) = 15.60 mag in SDSS. No. 4 galaxy has m(r) ~ 17.02 
mag in our image, being consistent with m(r) = 16.99 mag in SDSS. Any 
significant optical transient within these two galaxies can be ruled out.

Full data analysis of the searching is ongoing.
