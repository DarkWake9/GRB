report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:23:38.23 UT on 10 January 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150110A (trigger 442578221 / 150110433).
which was also detected by the MAXI/GSC (Negoro et al. 2015, GCN 17290)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the MAXI/GSC position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of 2 peaks
with a combined duration (T90) of about 74 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.05 s to T0+73.73 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.99 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 77.2 +/- 2.7 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.81 +/- 0.06)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+61.1 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 7.49 +/- .286 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
