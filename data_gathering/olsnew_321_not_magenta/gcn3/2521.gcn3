SUBJECT: GRB040106, follow-up radio observations

D. A. Frail (NRAO), M. Wieringa (ATNF) and A. M. Soderberg (Caltech)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"On 2004 Jan. 21.48 UT we carried out follow-up observations with the
VLA centered on the XMM X-ray source (GCN# 2508,2512) within the
INTEGRAL error circle (GCN#2505). We did not detect the ATCA radio
source claimed earlier (GCN#2516) in the preliminary XMM error circle.
The VLA flux density limits at the position of the revised XMM error
circle (GCN#2520) are 4 +/- 50 microJy and -77 +/- 85 microJy, at 8.46
and 4.86 GHz, respectively.

No further observations are planned."
