TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

Dear Colleagues:

This note is to inform you that,  under the aegis of our AO-9
program, we have requested observations of GRB 000926 (GCN 801) with the
Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory.  This burst with
a bright optical (GC 803, 804) and radio (GCN 805) afterglow appears
to be particularly well suited for detailed studies of the afterglow
and the circumburst medium.

We encourage intensive ground based observations of this burst so that
it will become a very well studied GRB. Particularly valuable are
intensive lightcurves at early times since the earliest HST observation
is at least a week away (as is the requested Chandra observation).  We
ourselves are planning to supplement the HST and CXO observations with
detailed multiwavelength observations at facilities to which our group
has access (e.g. Keck, Palomar, MDM, HET). In the radio, we will be
undertaking observations at VLA and OVRO and possibly other facilities
as well.

Shri Kulkarni, on behalf of a large international GRB collaboration.
