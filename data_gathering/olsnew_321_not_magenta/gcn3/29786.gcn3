Nat Butler (ASU) and Martin Jelinek (ASU AV CR Ondrejov) report:

We performed a joint inspection of the D50 (Jelinek et al., GCNC29780) and
RATIR (Butler et al.,  GCNC29784) images and agreed that the object
reported in both circulars is identical. Joint photometric fit of the data
provides a decay rate of 1.18 Â± 0.24 (chisq=1.68). Seeing this, we conclude
that this object is indeed the optical afterglow of GRB 210410A  (cf. Fermi
team, GCN 29777, Melandri et al., GCN 29778, Arimoto at al., GCN
29781, Ursi et al., GCNC 29782).

The preliminary coordinates reported by the D50 team are flawed and the
RATIR value, i.e. RA, Dec = 17:59:1.00, +45:21:44.6 (J2000, +/-0.5") should
be used.
