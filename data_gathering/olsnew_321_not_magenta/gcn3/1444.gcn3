report:

We have imaged of the error box for GRB 020625 / HETE #2081 
with the 0.70-m Cassegrain telescope of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory
(field 15x15 arcminutes). 

We obtained several frames which include the center of error box
and partially covered its area on 2002 Jun. 25.9138 
(10.5h after the burst) - 25.9861 UT. 

We do not identify any afterglow candidate on visual comparison with 
the DSS2 to a limit approximately R ~ 18.2 mag.
