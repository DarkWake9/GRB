I.A. Steele, C.M. Copperwheat, A.S. Piascik (Liverpool JMU) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We report Liverpool Telescope (La Palma) observations of iPTF-15dld and iPTF-15dni.

SPRAT Spectroscopy and IO:O broad band optical photometry of iPTF-15dld was obtained on the
night of 2015-11-06.  Interpolating over the host galaxy emission lines in the spectrum reveals
a continuum with broad emission features.  With the data to hand we are
not confident in subtraction of the host galaxy continuum from that of the transient.  The
spectrum is broadly consistent with the identification made as a Type Ic broad line
supernova in GCN18632 but we are not able to constrain the redshift or age.  Depending
on observation priorities we may schedule some further spectroscopy and photometry
at later times.

SPRAT Spectroscopy and IO:O redshifted H-alpha optical imaging of iPTF-15dni
was obtained on the night of 2015-11-05.  Comparison of the spectrum with our
earlier spectrum obtained on 2015-10-28 and reported in GCN18549 shows no
significant change in the H-alpha emission line.  Our H-alpha images show the galaxy
has many apparent star forming regions, although we can not resolve the location of the 
transient in H-alpha from the galaxy core without a reference image at this time.   
Depending on observation priorities we may schedule some further spectroscopy 
and photometry at later times.
