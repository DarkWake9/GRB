W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 07811
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
45 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.4E-06 erg/cm2, and
a peak flux of approximately  4.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 5000 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  11 h 58 m 30.84 s    -69 o 26 '   9.93 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 11 h 45 m 46.63 s    -69 o 40 '  56.36 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 10 h 32 m 13.96 s    -69 o 27 '  47.92 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 13 h 13 m  6.26 s    -66 o 58 '  57.37 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 12 h 10 m 52.13 s    -69 o  7 '  59.60 " 

This error box may be improved, but as Ulysses, Earth, and Mars
are still almost aligned, a small error box cannot be derived
for this event.
