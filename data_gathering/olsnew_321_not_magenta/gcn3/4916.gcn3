S. Covino (INAF/OABr), L.A. Antonelli (INAF/OAR), D. Fugazza, P. 
D'Avanzo (INAF/ OABr), and D. Malesani (SISSA), report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed again the field of GRB 060323 (Vetere et al., GCN 4904; 
Parsons et al., GCN 4912) with the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope. 
Observations were acquired in the V and R filters (20 min exposure). The 
mean time of the R-band exposure was Mar 24.239 UT (15.2 hr after the GRB).

The candidate afterglow inside the XRT error circle (Kennea et al., GCN 
4908) reported by Covino et al. (GCN 4911; see also Kann et al., GCN 
4913; Jensen et al., GCN 4915) is no longer visibile. The two datasets 
have comparable image quality. We therefore confirm this is the optical 
afterglow of GRB 060323.

We thank the TNG staff for their excellent support.
