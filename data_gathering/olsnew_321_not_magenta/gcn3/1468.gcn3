At 10:41:43.98 UTC (38503.98 s UT) on 12 Aug 2002, the HETE FREGATE and
WXM instruments detected event H2257, a long GRB.  The WXM flight
localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Position Notice at
10:50:48 UT, 9 min 4 sec after the burst.  Ground analysis produced a
refined location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at
13:19:48 UT, 158 minutes after the burst.  This location can be
expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle that is 10 arcminutes by 25
arcminutes and is centered at

RA = 20h 38m 48s, Dec = -05o 23' 34" (J2000).


The corners of the location rectangle lie at the following J2000
coordinates:

RA = 20h 39m 18s, Dec = -05o 35' 06"
RA = 20h 38m 38s, Dec = -05o 36' 36"
RA = 20h 38m 17s, Dec = -05o 12' 03"
RA = 20h 38m 57s, Dec = -05o 10' 34".


In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~20 seconds.
A  total of 1741 net counts were detected in the 8-40 keV band during
this interval, corresponding to a fluence of ~3.1 x 10-7 ergs cm-2.  The
peak flux averaged over 0.5 s was 4.9 x 10-8 ergs cm-2 s-1 (i.e., 1.6 x
Crab flux).  In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~20
seconds.  The WXM localization SNR was 6.3 in the X-detector and 8.3 in
the Y-detector.
