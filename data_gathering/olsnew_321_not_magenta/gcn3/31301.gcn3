The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 23:31:40 UT on 24 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211224A (trigger 662081505.061428 / 211224980).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 220.9, Dec = -41.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 43m, -41d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
