Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141031B (trigger #617149) (Gompertz, et al.,
GCN Circ. 16998).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 356.883, 41.355 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  23h 47m 31.9s
    Dec(J2000) = +41d 21' 19.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows one weak FRED peak.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
16.0 +- 3.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+1.21 to T+18.21 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.36 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.5 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.21 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.3 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
