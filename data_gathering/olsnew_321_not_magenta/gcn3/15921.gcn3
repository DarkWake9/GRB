We have observed the afterglow of 140304A (Gorbovskoy et al. GCN 15914, Evans et 
al. GCN 15915) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. 
Observations started at 20:19 UT on March 4 (i.e., 6.95 hr after the burst) in r and g-bands.
The afterglow is clearly detected in r-band at 20.5 mag, but undetected in g-band down to 
a 3-sigma limit of 21.5, pointing towards a high-redshift event at z ~ 5 if the Lyman break 
is between g and r-band. 

Further observations are ongoing.
