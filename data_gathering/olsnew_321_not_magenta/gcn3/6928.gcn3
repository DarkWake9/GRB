D. Stern (JPL), D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley), N. Reddy (NOAO), J. X. 
Prochaska (UCSC), H. Spinrad (UCB) and M. Dickinson (NOAO) report:

On the night of 2007 Oct. 11 we observed the afterglow of GRB 071010B 
(GCN 6871, Markwardt et al.; GCN 6873, Okansen et al.) with the Keck II 
10m telescope + DEIMOS, for a total integration time of 1260 seconds, 
starting at 14:41 UT.  The wavelength coverage was between 5230 and 
10480 Angstroms.

The detection of MgII previously reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 6888) and 
Prochaska et al. (GCN 6890) at a redshift of 0.947 is further confirmed, 
as is a weak detection of MgI 2852.

In addition, the [OII] 3727 doublet emission feature is well-detected at 
the same redshift, superimposed on the continuum.  [OIII] 5008 is also 
detected, as is (marginally) [OIII] 4960.

These results strongly suggest that the redshift of GRB 071010B and its 
host galaxy is most likely 0.947.
