D. Fugazza, S. Covino, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (INAF-OAR), P.
D'Avanzo, S. Campana, G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB) and E. Palazzi
(INAF-IASFBo) on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 111204A (Sonbas et al. GCN 12612) with the
3.6m TNG equipped with the NICS near-infrared camera. A sequence of JHK
band images were acquired starting on Dec 04.792 UT (i.e. ~5.4 hours after
the burst event) lasting 15, 10 and 20 minutes, respectively.

We do not detect any object inside the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et
al. GCN 12614) down to the following limiting magnitudes (3sigma c.l.,
calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue):

J > 19.7
H > 18.8
Ks > 18.8

We thank the TNG staff for their support, in particular Luca di Fabrizio
and Gianni Tessicini.
