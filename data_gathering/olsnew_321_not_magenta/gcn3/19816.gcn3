and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160814A (Kawakubo et al., GCN Circ. 19793;
Kozlova et al., GCN Circ. 19800) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 21:12:42.39 on 14 August 2016.  The burst signal was seen by
all CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing
computer, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows two episodes.  The first weak episode
starts from T-60 sec, peaks at T-55 sec and ends at T-50 sec.  The
second episode starts from T+1 sec, peaks at T+3 sec and ends at T+12 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 10 +- 1 sec (40-230 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
