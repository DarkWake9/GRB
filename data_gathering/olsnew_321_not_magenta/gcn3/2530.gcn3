Michel G. Breitfellner, Puri Munuera and Alberto Martos report:

Due to automated procedure errors, XMM-Newton has issued two
GCN circulars today with incorrect subject headers.  We here
re-issue the latest circular with a corrected header. Procedures
are being updated to avoid a recurrence of this problem.

Quick-Look-Analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of the
GRB040223 field (D. Gotz et al. GCN 2525), based on
7 ks exposures in the EPIC pn and MOS cameras,
respectively, shows the presence of a source within the
INTEGRAL error circle.

XMMU J163929.9-415601 (J2000):
R.A. = 16h 39m 29.9s  Decl. = -41deg 56'  1.4"
with an estimated EPIC/pn count rate of 0.002 [counts/sec];

At this stage of reduction the position error is expected to
be less than 6".
