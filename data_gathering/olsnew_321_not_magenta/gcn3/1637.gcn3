Ulysses, Konus, Helicon, and HETE-FREGATE observed this burst
at 23510 seconds (HETE trigger 2389).  As observed by Ulysses,
it had a duration ~10 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of ~4x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux over 0.5 s of ~3.4E-7 erg/cm2 s.  We have
triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma annulus centered
at RA, Decl=176.706, +36.394, whose radius is 79.291 +/- 0.062
degrees.

Earth-blocking, ecliptic latitude, and field-of-view considerations
limit the arrival direction to that section of the annulus between
RA, Decl=81, +25 degrees and RA, Decl=64, +44 degrees.  

This error box can be refined, but since the burst was not
observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived
for it.
