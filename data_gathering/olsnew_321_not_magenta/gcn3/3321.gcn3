on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT triggered (trigger=115881, GCN Circ 3320) at 13:29:35 UT
is not due to a GRB.  The trigger occured on the rising edge of the SAA.
Ground analysis has confirmed the very low image-domain detection significance.
A visual inspection of the mask-tagged light curve also shows no
significant emission.
