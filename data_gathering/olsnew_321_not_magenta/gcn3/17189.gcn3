report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:26:15.75 on December 15 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 141215A (trigger 440342778/141215560). 
GBM's location is consistent with the IPN 
Triangulation (K. Hurley et al. 2014, GCN 17186). 

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 
130 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of three peaks with a duration
(T90) of about 11 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+14.2 s 
is best fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.62 +/- 0.03
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 392 +/- 11 keV.
The spectrum is equally well fit by the BAND function 
with Beta = -3.5 +/- 0.5. 
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.94 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1 sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+10.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 20.6 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
