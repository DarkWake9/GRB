and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170607A (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 21214;
Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 21218; INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7864)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:17:56.98
on 7 June 2017.  The burst signal was seen only by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows two distinct peaks.  The first
peak starts at T+2 sec, peaks at T+4 sec and ends at T+8 sec.
The second peak starts at T+210 sec, peaks at T+215 sec and
ends at T+230 sec.  The T90 durations of the first peak and the
second peak measured by the SGM data separately are 4.0 +- 0.5 sec
and 10.5 +- 0.8 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
