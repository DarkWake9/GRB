GBM was observing 81% of the LIGO probability map for G275404 at the
event time, with much of the northern high probability region and half of
the southern arc observed. There is no GBM
on-board trigger around the event time. The untargeted ground-based
search of GBM data for short-duration GRBs (Briggs et al., in prep) found
no candidates close in time to G275404.
The targeted search of the GBM data ([1], [2]) also did not find a
significant gamma-ray signal. This search processes time scales of 0.256 to
8.192 s within 30 s of the LIGO event. No interesting gamma-ray candidate
was found within this time window.

Any prompt gamma-ray burst emission, above the GBM detection threshold,
must have been occulted by the Earth for Fermi.  The Earth-occulted region
is a circle with radius of 68 degrees, centered on RA, Dec = 134.5, +25.6.

Further analysis and upper limits will be reported later.
