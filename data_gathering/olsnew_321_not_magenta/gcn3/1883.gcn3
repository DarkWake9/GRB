TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1883
SUBJECT: GRB030226: Optical decay index

FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

D.W. Fox (Caltech), P.A. Price (RSAA/ANU), and H.W. Chen (MIT) report:  

"Observations from the Dupont telescope at Las Campanas reveal
continued fading of this afterglow (GCNs 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882).  In
four I-band images taken over the period from 0.1 to 0.2 days after
the burst (Epoch: 26 Feb 03:46:32 UT), the afterglow decay may be fit
with a power-law of index alpha~-0.85, as referenced against a large
number of stars in the field."
