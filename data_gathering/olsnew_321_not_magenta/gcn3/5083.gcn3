and the HXD-II team report: 

The short hard burst, GRB 060429 (Hurley et al., GCN 5039,  
Golenetskii et al., GCN 5067), triggered the Suzaku 
Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which is sensitive to an 
energy band of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 12:19:51 (UT). 
The observed light curve shows a single-peak structure
with a duration (T90) of 0.11 seconds. 
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.97 +- 0.17 X10^-6 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak flux was 3.2 +- 0.3 photons/cm2/sec 
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum 
is well fitted by a single power law with a photon index 
of 1.07 +- 0.13.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
The WAM in-flight calibration is still under way, and systematic 
errors, such as the flux calibration uncertainties of about 20%, 
are not included in the errors.

The WAM light curve of this event is available at

Further detailed analysis and the refinement are in progress.
