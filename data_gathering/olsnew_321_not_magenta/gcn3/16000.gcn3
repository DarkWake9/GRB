D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 02:12:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140320A (trigger=592544).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 281.857, -11.173 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 47m 26s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 10' 21"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with two peaks separated by ~140 sec and a total duration 
of about 150 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

No source was detected in 57 s of promptly downlinked data. We are
waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the XRT
counterpart. 

Due to partial real-time telemetry, no further information is
available at this time.  However the burst was also detected
by the Fermi-GBM instrument, verifying its reality. 
More details will be available following the next ground pass 
telemetry dump. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. K. Cannizzo (cannizzo AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
