SUBJECT: GRB 081012 - Enhanced Swift XRT position

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne and A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 1387 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 2 UVOT images, we find 
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment 
and matching to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 30.2009, -17.6383 which 
is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 02 00 48.22
Dec (J2000): -17 38 18.0

with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcsec (90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest 
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position 
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf), the current algorithm is 
an extension of this method. 

This circular is an offical product of the Swift XRT team.
