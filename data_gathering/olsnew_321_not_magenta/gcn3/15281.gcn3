J. R. Cummings (UMBC/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 2013-10-01T05:37:24, while Swift was slewing, GRB 131001A occurred.  The
BAT lightcurve shows a single 5-second long FRED peak.  In a mosaic of images
created from BAT slew data, a significant source was found at
RA, Dec 8.302, +25.557, which is

RA  (J2000)   00h 33m 12.4s
Dec (J2000)   25d 33' 27"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 1.8 arcmin.

A Swift TOO has been requested to locate the X-ray afterglow, and approved with
the source ID number20297.  Observations are in progress.
