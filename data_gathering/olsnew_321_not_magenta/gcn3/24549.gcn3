Report on behalf of the TAROT network and GRANDMA collaborations.

We performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo S190513bm event (GCN
#24522) with the TAROT-Chili (TCH) telescope operating with a clear
filter located at La Silla ESO observatory (LaS/ESO), and with the
TAROT-Calern (TCA) telescope operating with a clear filter located at
Calern site at the Cote d'Azur observatory.

The TCA observation started on 05/13/19 21:34:47 UTC which corresponds
approximately to 41 minutes after the GW trigger time.

We performed the following tiled observations :

TStart and TEnd refers respectively to the time of the first and last
exposure for a given tile. Observations are not necessarily continuous
in this interval.
The Probability refers to the 2D spatial
probability of the GW skymap enclosed in a given tile. Each tile is
1.9x1.9 degrees. The TCA  and TCH telescope observations cover
7% and 17% of the cumulative probability of the skymap respectively,
for a total of 24% coverage. The typical limiting magnitude is 18.0
for a 60.0 s exposure.

Potential optical transient candidates list will be sent
through another GCN circular depending on our data analysis.
