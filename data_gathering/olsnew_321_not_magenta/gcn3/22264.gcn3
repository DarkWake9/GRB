Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR, Stockholm University), A. J. Nayana
(NCRA-TIFR), Dipankar Bhattacharya (IUCAA), S. Bradley Cenko (NASA) and
Alessandra Corsi (Texas Tech University) report:

In our continuing follow up, we observed GRB 171205A (D'Elia et al., GCN 
Circ. 22177) with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2017 Dec 
19.07 UT at 1400 MHz band. We detect radio emission at the GRB position 
(Laskar et al.  GCN 22216) with a flux density o 782+/-57 uJy. The map rms 
is 33 uJy.

More observations are planned. We thank the GMRT staff to schedule the
observations.
