TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline and
E. Mazets, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed a gamma-ray burst on January 31,
2000 at 14:59:13 UT.  Its T90 duration was ~50 s and its 25-100
keV fluence was ~10^-5 erg/cm^2.  At present, it can only be localized
to two alternate ~55 sq. arcmin. error boxes given by the following 
preliminary centers and corners (~3 sigma confidence):

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   6 h 13 m 32.72 s    -51 o 55 '  36.77 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  6 h 13 m  8.83 s    -52 o  2 '  20.83 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  6 h 13 m 25.43 s    -51 o 50 '  11.43 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  6 h 13 m 40.09 s    -52 o  1 '   1.94 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  6 h 13 m 56.59 s    -51 o 48 '  52.07 "
 
     OR

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  10 h 48 m 50.99 s      4 o 34 '   1.70 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 10 h 49 m 21.03 s      4 o 35 '  42.55 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 10 h 48 m 31.31 s      4 o 36 '  35.98 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 10 h 49 m 10.65 s      4 o 31 '  26.95 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 10 h 48 m 20.91 s      4 o 32 '  19.87 " 

There is a fair chance that further processing will allow one
of these positions to be ruled out.
