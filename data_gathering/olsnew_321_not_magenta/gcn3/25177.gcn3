The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:17:56 UT on 27 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190727B (trigger 585951481.447196 / 190727846).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 130.6, Dec = -15.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 42m, -15d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44.0 degrees.
