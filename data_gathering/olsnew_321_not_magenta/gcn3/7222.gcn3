TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7222
SUBJECT: Swift trigger(=301779) is not a GRB

Swift trigger (=301779, trig_time=19:11:20.16 UT) is not due to a burst,
nor anything astrophysical.  This trigger is a result from the testing
of the SubThresold operational mode in Swift.  Some of the UVOT Notice types
(Source List and Image) were distributed to the world.  This distribution
was the result of stopping and restarting the GCN programs and as a result
the "state vector" of which triggers were to be considered SubThreshold and
which were normal triggers got lost.  And this restarting was done too quickly
after a prior SubThreshold trigger such that after the spacecraft came out
of a Malindi downlink pass, the TDRSS transmission channel resumed operations
and transmitted down the remaining UVOT notices.  We apologize for the
confusion and inconvenience.
