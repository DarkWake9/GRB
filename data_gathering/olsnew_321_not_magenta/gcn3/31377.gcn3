The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:03:12 UT on 3 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220103A (trigger 662936597.88881 / 220103877).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 36.9, Dec = -15.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 27m, -15d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 63.0 degrees.
