Using the full data set from T-4 to T+16 sec (all the data we will
get on this ground-detected burst), we report further analysis
of BAT GRB 051114 (trigger #163844) (Cummings, et al., GCN 4272). 
The BAT ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 226.266d,+60.156d
{15h 05m 04s,60d 09' 22"} [deg; J2000] +- 2 arcmin, (radius,
sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 78%. 

The light curve shows two peaks of roughly equal intensity, the 
second slightly softer, one from T+0.2 to T+0.9 sec and one from 
T+1.3 to T+2.7 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is (2.2 +- 0.3) sec (estimated 
error including systematics). 

The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.22 +- 0.27. 
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (1.32 +- 0.24) x 10^-7 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.2 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is (0.73 +- 0.16) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the
90% confidence level.
