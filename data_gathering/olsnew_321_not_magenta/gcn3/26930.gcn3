In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S200129m at T0 = 2020-01-29 06:54:58.435
(UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found
no event  candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, 100% of the S200129m 90% c.l. localization region was accessible to the
AGILE MCAL. 3-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible S200129m localization region,
from a minimum of 1.3E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 2.7E-06 erg cm^-2
(assuming as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the energy range
0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
