D. Xu (DARK/NBI), X. Zhang, G.-J. Feng, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the XRT field (Kennea et al., GCN 15335), which contains
an uncatalogued point source as the possible X-ray afterglow of GRB
131014A (Fitzpatrick et al., GCN 15332; Desiante et al., GCN 15333),
using the 1m telescope located Mt. Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We
obtained 2x600s R-band images at a high airmass of ~2.4 and at the
mean time of 2013-10-14 22:52:52 UT (i.e., 17.73 hr after the Fermi
trigger).

A faint source is marginally detected at the North-West border of the
XRT error circle in Kennea et al. (GCN 15335) in the stacked image,
and its position is consistent with that of the object already present
in the DSS finding chart at coordinates

R.A. (J2000) = 06:41:11.950
Dec. (J2000) = -19:05:46.94

However, the seemingly extended structure of the object within the XRT
error in the DSS chart is not present in our image, which sets a
constraint of R > ~20.5 mag for any source within the XRT error
circle, calibrated with nearby USNO B1 field.
