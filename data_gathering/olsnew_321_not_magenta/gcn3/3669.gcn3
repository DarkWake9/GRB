We have analyzed the Swift XRT data from the first orbit observation of 
GRB 050724 (Covino et al., GCN 3665). The new refined coordinates are: 
RA(J2000) =  16h 24m 45s  Dec(J2000) = -27 32 25.2. This position is 65 
arcseconds from the refined BAT position given in GCN 3667 (H. Krimm et 
al), and 9 arcseconds from the XRT position given in GCN 3665. We 
estimate an uncertainty of 6.3 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
However, we note that there is accumulating evidence of a time-dependent 
systematic shift in XRT positions derived from ground-processed data 
towards lower declinations than the optical counterparts. This effect is 
being investigated but is not yet understood.  Extrapolation of earlier 
positional errors suggests that the correct position could be 
approximately 7 arcseconds north of the position given above, which 
would be close to the on-board position given in GCN 3665.

A preliminary spectral fit (simple absorbed power-law) to the WT data 
yields a photon index of 1.93-/+0.05 in the [0.5-10] keV band. The 
derived NH is (5.7)E21 cm^-2, which is higher than the Galactic value 
(1.46E+21 cm-2; Dickey & Lockman 1990). The average (79-342 seconds from 
trigger) estimated unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux is 5.3E-9 ergs/s/cm2.

The light curves in Windowed Timing (WT) and Photon Counting (PC) mode 
start 79 and 343 seconds from the BAT trigger (T0), and they show a 
fading afterglow which can be fitted with a broken power law of slopes 
-3.2+/-0.1 and -0.8+/-0.2. The unabsorbed 0.5-10.0 keV flux at 24 hours 
after the burst is then estimated to 9E-14 ergs/s/cm2.
