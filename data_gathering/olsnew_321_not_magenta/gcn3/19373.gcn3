W. Fong and P. Milne (University of Arizona) report:

"We observed the field of GRB 160501A (Cummings et al., GCN 19365) with the
Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) mounted on the 3.8-m United Kingdom Infrared
Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea beginning on 2016 May 1.533 UT (12.1 hr
post-burst). We obtained observations in the J- and K-bands in 0.75"
seeing. Using the quick-look pipeline ORAC-DR, we do not detect any near-IR
source in or around enhanced X-ray position (Evans et al., GCN 19369).
Calibrated to 2MASS, we therefore place 3-sigma limits of J(AB)>19.7 mag
and K(AB)>19.2 mag on the near-IR afterglow of GRB 160501A at 12.1 hr
post-burst. We note that this analysis is preliminary and a final reduction
of the images are expected to be at least ~1.5 mag deeper.

We thank Tim Carroll, Watson Varricatt and Tom Kerr for their assistance in
planning and executing these observations."
