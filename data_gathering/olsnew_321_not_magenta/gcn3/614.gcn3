K. Hurley, E. Mazets, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses,
KONUS, and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, KONUS-Wind, and NEAR observed GRB000315 at 83980 s
UT.  The burst had a 25-100 keV fluence of ~4x10^-5 erg/cm^2
and a T90 duration of ~60 s.  Triangulation gives two alternate
error boxes, each ~16 sq. arcmin. in area, at the following
locations:


    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 22 h 43 m 20.56 s     17 o 59 '  35.54 "  (CENTER)
 22 h 43 m 26.35 s     17 o 58 '  14.67 "  (CORNER)
 22 h 43 m 11.47 s     17 o 56 '   5.72 "  (CORNER)
 22 h 43 m 29.63 s     18 o  3 '   5.58 "  (CORNER)
 22 h 43 m 14.76 s     18 o  0 '  56.38 "  (CORNER)
              OR  
    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 18 h 44 m 31.20 s     40 o 32 '  52.47 "  (CENTER)
 18 h 44 m 21.05 s     40 o 32 '  49.02 "  (CORNER)
 18 h 44 m 27.09 s     40 o 28 '  50.27 "  (CORNER)
 18 h 44 m 35.35 s     40 o 36 '  54.58 "  (CORNER)
 18 h 44 m 41.34 s     40 o 32 '  55.83 "  (CORNER)

There is a slight chance that further processing will
eliminate one of these error boxes.  Refinements to them
are possible.
