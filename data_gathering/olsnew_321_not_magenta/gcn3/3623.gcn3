report for the Swift team:


At 12:36:04 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 050716 (trigger=146227).  The BAT on-board calculated
location is RA,Dec 338.598d {+22h 34m 23s}, +38.696d {+38d 41' 46"}
(J2000), with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, including estimated
systematic uncertainty; 90% containment).  The BAT light curve showed
a multi-peak structure with a duration of at least 40 seconds.  The
15-350 keV peak count rate was ~1300 counts/sec, measured by BAT at
~10 seconds after the trigger.

The spacecraft slewed immediately and the XRT began observing the
burst at 12:37:40 UT (96 seconds after the BAT trigger). The XRT found
a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source. The on board calculated position
is:

RA:     22h 34m 20.4s (J2000),
Dec:   -38d 40' 56.7" (J2000).

This position is 60.6 arcseconds from the BAT position.  The estimated
uncertainty is 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).


The Swift Ultra Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) observations began at
12:37:43 UT, 99 seconds after the BAT trigger. The first data taken
after the spacecraft settled was a 100 sec exposure using the V filter
with the midpoint of the observation at 149 sec after the BAT
trigger. Based on comparisons to the DSS, we detect no new source at
the XRT position.
