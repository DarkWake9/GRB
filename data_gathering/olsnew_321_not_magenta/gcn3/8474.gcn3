V. Mangano, V. La Parola (INAF-IASF PA), P. Evans (U. Leicester)
report on behalf the Swift XRT Team:


Swift slewed to the target (trigger=333666, Parsons et al.,
GCN Circ. 8473) at about 10:14:00 UT.
Using promptly downlinked XRT data we find an uncatalogued
source located at RA,Dec = 100.4835, -54.7211
which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) =  06 41 56.04
DEC (J2000.0) =  -54 43 15.9

with an uncertainty of 4.04 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This location is 39.4 arcsec from the BAT position, inside the BAT
error circle.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
