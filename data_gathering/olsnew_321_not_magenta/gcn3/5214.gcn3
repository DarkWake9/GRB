Using the data set from T-119.2 to T+182.9 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060604 (trigger #213486)
(Page, et al., GCN 5212).  The BAT ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) 
337.233, -10.937 deg {22h 28m 55.8s, -10d 56' 14.8"} (J2000) +- 2.9 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 72%.

The burst was very weak in BAT. There was some low-level soft emission 
over ~25 seconds starting at T-50, followed by the main peak at T+0.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10 +- 3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.4 to T+8.3 is best fit by a simple 
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.90 +- 0.41.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+2.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
