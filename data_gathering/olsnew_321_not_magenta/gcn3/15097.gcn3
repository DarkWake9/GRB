At 01:46:55 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130816A (trigger=566545).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 197.167, -58.948 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 08m 40s
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 56' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 01:48:23.2 UT, 87.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 197.1399, -58.9452
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 13h 08m 33.59s
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 56' 42.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 51 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (3.87 x
10^21 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 4
(+4.03/-3.22) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 91 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the large, but uncertain extinction expected. The
crowded field also makes the identification of a new source more difficult. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. T. Holland (sholland AT stsci.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
