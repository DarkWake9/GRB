Johan Fynbo (DARK/NBI), Pierre-Olivier Quirion (Univ. Aarhus), Dong Xu,
Daniele Malesani, C. C. Thoene, J. Hjorth, B. Milvang-Jensen (DARK/NBI),
and Pall Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 080603B (Mangano et al., GCN 7794) with the
NOT telescope. We obtained R-band imaging and a low resolution
spectrum using the AlFOSC instrument. Based on the detection of
Lyman-alpha and a number of relatively strong metal lines we infer a
redshift of 2.69.
