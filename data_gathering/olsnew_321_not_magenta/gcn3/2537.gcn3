"We have observed the entire HETE-2 error region of GRB040228
(Nakagawa et al. GCN2536) with Kiso observatory 1.05 m Schmidt
telescope using 2kx2k CCD camera which field of view is 50 x 50
arcmin.  We obtained Rc-band data sets (300 sec x 4 frames), starting
at Feb. 28 12:11 UT (0.5 days after the burst). The limiting magnitude
for each images is about 19.5 mag.  Comparison with DSS II red images,
no new object was detected down to the limiting magnitude."
