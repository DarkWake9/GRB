Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 061110B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 238174) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 621.9s after the GRB trigger
(6.1s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
from 22 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2006-11-10T21:58:45.120

The first image is 90.0s exposure in tracking mode.
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+622s to t0+712s : R > 16.6

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+622s to t0+1098s : R > 16.9

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

Further observations are planed.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 61.2688 lat=-31.7065
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.2 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
