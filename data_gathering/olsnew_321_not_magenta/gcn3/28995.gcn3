Using the data set from T-239 to T+130 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201203A (trigger #1010946)
(Dichiara et al., GCN Circ. 28985).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 38.055, -26.505 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 32m 13.1s
   Dec(J2000) = -26d 30' 19.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 91%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 12.18 +- 2.10 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.73 to T+12.84 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.78 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.9 +- 0.5 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.49 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
