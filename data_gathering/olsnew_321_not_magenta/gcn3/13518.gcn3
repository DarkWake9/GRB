We observed the region of  optical afterglow (Cenko et al., GCN 13489)  of
IPN localized GRB 120716A (Hurley et al., GCN 13487)  with AZT-11 telescope
of CrAO observatory starting on July 19  (UT) 18:51 under seeing  of about
3.3 arsces.   We do not detected  optical afterglow  up to R=20.8. The
photometry is based on the  USNO-B1.0 star 0996-0576906 (20 52 01.46 +09 36
17.8)  assuming R=15.97:
