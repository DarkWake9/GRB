SUBJECT: GRB050209: TAROT optical observations

Alain Klotz (CESR-OHP), and Michel Boer, (OHP) on behalf of the TAROT team
report:

"We imaged the entire field of GRB 050209 with the TAROT robotic telescope
located at the Calern observatory, France. Observations started 26 seconds
after the receipt of the GCN notice, i.e. approx. 2h25 after the event. The
position was at an elevation of 22 degrees above the western horizon. No new
source was detected after a comparison with the USNO A2-0 catalogue. From a
frame to frame study no decaying source was found. We co-added 84 30s
images: we reach a limiting R magnitude of 19.2.
