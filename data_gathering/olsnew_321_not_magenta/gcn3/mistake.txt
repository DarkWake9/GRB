This Circular was a mistaken submission.  This is usaully due
to a Circular recipient using an email program that does not
pay attention to the "reply-to" field in the original email.
It has been removed from the list and the official archive.
In this particular instance, the Circular Number was not rolled back.

Sincerly,
Scott Barthelmy
