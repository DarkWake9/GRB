We observed the field of Swift trigger 420256 (Hoversten et al., GCNC 
10654) with the 0.5m telescope D50 in Ondrejov (Czech Republic), starting 
at 02:49:04 UT, i.e. 302s after the trigger. A sequence of 20s unfiltered 
images was obtained. We coadded 15x20s exposure, obtaining an image with a 
limitting magnitude Rc~18.0, with an effective exposure time 539s after 
the trigger. We do not detect any new source in combined or single images.
