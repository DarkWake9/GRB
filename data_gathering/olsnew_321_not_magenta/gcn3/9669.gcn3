SUBJECT: Swift problem fixed

The anomaly with the Swift on-board solid state recorder has been
resolved and the mission is back to autonomous slewing for GRBs.
Normal observing and TOO requests will be enabled tomorrow (July
16) morning.

The anomaly was resolved by sending a "stop all transfers"
command to the recorder on July 15 at ~1500UT.  This essentially
reset the input and output interfaces.  Data dumps following the
commanding indicate that the recorder is working normally again.
An investigation on the root cause is in progress.
