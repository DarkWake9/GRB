A. Stefanescu, F. Schrey, G. Kanbach, S. Duscha, M. Mühlegger, N.
Prymak, H. Steinle (MPE Munich) of the OPTIMA-Burst Team report the 
following:
"OPTIMA-Burst at the 1.3m Skinakas Observatory, located on Crete, Greece
observed the Swift XRT-Errorbox of GRB 060707 at 00:30 UT (3h after the
Burst).
We detected a faint source at the edge of the XRT-errorcircle (GCN
Circular #5285). We estimate the brightness of this source in a 10min
white-light image as 20.3+-.5mag. The position of the source is RA
23:48:19 Dec -17:54:18.4 (J2000). There is no source at this position in
the USNO-A2 Catalog, and no minor planet according to MPChecker.
  This source seems compatible with the source reported in GCN Circular 
5290"
