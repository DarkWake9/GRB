report:

Mars Odyssey and Konus-Wind observed GRB051022 (=H3950, GCN 4131
and 4137).  We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA, Decl(J2000)=47.9138, +16.5422 degrees, whose radius is
46.4533 +/- 0.0684 degrees (3 sigma).  The center line of this
annulus passes 0.004 degrees from the HETE SXC position, and
the annulus just encompasses the SXC error circle, without
substantially reducing its area.  We also confirm that this
burst was exceptionally bright, and that its duration, as observed
by HEND (>~50 keV), was about 200 s.  More details will follow.
