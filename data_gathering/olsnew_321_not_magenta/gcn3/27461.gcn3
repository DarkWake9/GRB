The AGILE satellite detected the short burst GRB 200327A reported by
Fermi/GBM (GCN #27458), that also triggered the automatic AGILE
Mini-CALorimeter (MCAL) GRB alert Notice (ID 512427408), published at:
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/agile_mcal.html.

The event was detected by MCAL at T0 = 2020-03-27 20:56:48.25 +/- 0.01 s
(UTC), lasting ~0.13 s and releasing a total number of ~150 counts in the
detector, above a background rate of ~530 Hz. The MCAL light curve can be
found at:
http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/GRB_067116_512427408.252268.png. The
time-integrated spectrum of the burst in 0.13 s can be fitted in the energy
range 0.4-10 MeV with a single power-law with ph.ind. = 2.56 -0.43/+0.54,
resulting in a reduced chi-squared of 1.19 (8 d.o.f.). The burst fluence in
the same energy range and time interval is 6.34e-07 erg/cm^2 (90%
confidence level).

At the T0, the event localization according to Fermi/GBM, RA = 233.4, Dec =
2.4 (J2000) was outside the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID)
Field-of-View.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
