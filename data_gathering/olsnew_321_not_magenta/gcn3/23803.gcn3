on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 09:20:09 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located MAXI J1631-479 (trigger=886486).  Swift slewed immediately to the
source. The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA, Dec 247.718, -47.807 which is
   RA(J2000) = 16h 30m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 48' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure.

The XRT began observing the field at 09:22:18.0 UT, 128.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, X-ray source located at RA, Dec
247.8086, -47.8071 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 16h 31m 14.06s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 48' 25.6"
with an uncertainty of 5.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment),
consistent with the known the known position of MAXI J1631-479. No event
data are yet available to determine the column density using X-ray
spectroscopy.
