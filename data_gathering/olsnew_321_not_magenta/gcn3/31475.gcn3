We observed the field of GRB 220117B detected by Swift (Melandri et al., 
GCN 31468) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. Observations automatically started at 20:07:36 UT on 2022-01-17, 
i.e., 128 s after the BAT trigger, and a series of 40 s, 60 s, 90 s 
frames were obtained in the Sloan r-band.

No uncatalogued optical transient is detected in our stacked images at 
the Swift-XRT position (GCN 31468), down to limiting magnitudes of 
r~18.5, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
