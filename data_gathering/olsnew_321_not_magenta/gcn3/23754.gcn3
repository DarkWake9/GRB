SUBJECT: GRB 190114C: REM optical/NIR detection (CORRECTION)

P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), on behalf of the REM team, report:

We noticed a typo in our GCN Circular 23729 (D'Avanzo et al.), reporting about REM observations of GRB 190114C. 
In that GCN Circular we reported a H-band magnitude, while the filter used to measure the NIR afterglow magnitude was J.

So, the magnitudes we measure in the REM images of GRB 190114C are:

r = 18.6 +/- 0.2
J = 16.7 +/- 0.1

(AB; calibrated against the pan-STARRS and the 2MASS catalogues), at a mean time of about 4.3 hours after the GRB. 

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
