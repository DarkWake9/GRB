Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210226A (trigger #1034721)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 29568).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 124.153, 57.585 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 16m 36.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +57d 35' 06.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 47%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 20.80 +- 1.68 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.92 to T+20.95 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.44 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
