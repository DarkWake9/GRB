Dale A. Frail (NRAO), P. Brian Cameron (Caltech), and Alicia
M. Soderberg (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 051109A (GCN 4213) with the Very Large
Array at 8.5 GHz around November 11.15 UT. At the position of the
optical transient (GCN 4211) there is a weak radio source with flux
density 117 ± 24 uJy.  We identify this as the radio afterglow of
GRB 051109A.
