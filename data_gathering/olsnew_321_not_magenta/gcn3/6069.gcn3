TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6069
SUBJECT: GRB070124: Swift-XRT Follow-up Observation
DATE:    07/02/02 00:13:08 GMT
FROM:    Loredana Vetere at PSU  <vetere@astro.psu.edu>

L. Vetere, J. Racusin, C. Pagani, D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

The entire IPN error box for GRB 070124 (Hurley et al., GCN 6022) has
been observed by XRT in three different pointings (target id. 20046,
20048, 20049 for the central, upper and lower part, respectively) with
different exposure times:

 target id           Tstart                     Tend             expo
   20046     2007-01-25  15:36:39.9    2007-01-31  22:55:58.2   22.5ks
   20048     2007-01-31  00:26:23.5    2007-01-31  23:03:57.7    6.1ks
   20049     2007-01-31  00:34:25.5    2007-01-31  23:12:56.4    6.5ks

Only four sources are detected inside the IPN error box with the following
positions (uncertainty of 5 arcsec, radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty) and count rates:

    Ra(J2000)    Dec(J2000)       count/s         target id
   14 45 03.4   +54 27 56.4   (1.2 +/- 0.3)E-03     20046
   14 46 09.9   +54 38 58.2   (6.9 +/- 2.6)E-04     20046
   14 44 53.2   +54 26 30.5   (1.8 +/- 0.4)E-03     20046
   14 44 53.9   +54 26 37.2   (1.8 +/- 0.8)E-03     20048

None of these sources shows a fading behaviour, we thus conclude that
XRT did not detect the X-ray afterglow of GRB 070124.
