SUBJECT: GRB 190324A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    19/03/25 00:51:49 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

M. Perri (ASDC), G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester),
J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU) and J.A. Kennea (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 190324A at 23:38:59.4 UT,
3297.9 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 49.62054,
-47.21240 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 18m 28.93s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 12' 44.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 145 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.75 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 7
(+3.19/-2.76) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
