SUBJECT: GRB 190714B: Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization
DATE:    19/07/14 22:18:39 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

At 13:44:39 UT on 14 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 190714B (trigger 584804684.038996 / 190714573).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 71.2, Dec = -6.1 with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 106.7 degrees.
