(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 141031B (Gompertz et al., GCN 16998) 
with  Zeiss-1000 (East) 1m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical 
Observatory on Oct., 31  starting on (UT) 15:39:02, i.e. ~0.7 hours 
after burst trigger. We took several images in R-filter of 600 exposure. 
In the first image we do not detect any object brighter than R=21.5 in 
XRT error circle (Gompertz et al., GCN 16998).

Details of the photometry are following:
