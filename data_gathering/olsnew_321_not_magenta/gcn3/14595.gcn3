We observed the field of GRB 130505A (Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circular
14563) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/05 7.13 to
2013/05 7.22 UTC (42.84 to 44.87 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 0.36 hours exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.14 hours
exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

The optical counterpart (Evans et al., GCN Circular 14569) is clearly
identified. We obtain the following detections and 3-sigma upper limits:

 r' = 21.10 ± 0.27
 i' = 20.98 ± 0.23
 Z	> 21.17
 Y	> 19.15
 J	> 18.38
 H	> 17.15

These magnitudes are in the AB system, are calibrated by comparison with
SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, and not corrected for Galactic extinction in the
direction of the GRB. The quoted uncertainties on the detections are 1
sigma.

We thus confirm the fading reported by other observers at earlier epochs
(Kuroda et al., GCN Circular 14568; Xu et al, GCN Circular 14570; Xin et
al., GCN Circular 14571; Hentunen et al, GCN Circular 14572; Krugly et
al., GCN Circular 14585; and Kann et al., GCN Circular 14593).

No further observations of this source are planned.

Mártir.
