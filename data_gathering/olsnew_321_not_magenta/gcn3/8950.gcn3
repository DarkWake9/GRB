National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),

(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the SWIFT-BAT position of recently re-activated Soft
Gamma-ray Repeater source SGR J1550-5418 or AXP 1E1547-5408 (GCN 8833)
at 4.800 and 4.928 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
between 01:00:00 UT and 22:00:00 UT on February 21/22, 2009.

The ATCA observations of SGR J1550-5418 were conducted immediately
before the VLBI ToO observations of the source with the Australian Long
Baseline Array (LBA).

We clearly detected a radio source at the position of the SGR J1550-5418
at the frequencies of 4.800 & 4.928 GHz. The data at these frequencies
were combined to make an image and the radio flux density at the source
position found out to be 68.3 +/- 4.3 mJy/beam.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
