Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150110B (trigger #624606)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 17291).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 289.374, 32.529 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 17m 29.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +32d 31' 43.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks starting at ~T-8 sec,
peaking at ~T-5 and ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.6 +- 0.95 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.94 to T+3.77 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.89 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.9 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
