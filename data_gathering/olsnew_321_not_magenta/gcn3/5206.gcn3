Using the data set from T-119.7 to T+182.3 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060602A
(trigger #213180)  (Schady, et al., GCN 5196).  The BAT 
ground-calculated position
is (RA,Dec) = 149.576, 0.322 deg {9h 58m 18.3s, 0d 19' 20.7"} (J2000)
+- 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial 
coding was 43%.

The light curve shows a single broad triangular shaped peak lasting from
~T+0 to ~T+70 sec.  The burst is most prominent in the 50-100 keV band and
shows clear evidence of hard to soft spectral evolution.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 60 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.7 to T+67.0 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.14 +- 0.16. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.6 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+7.74 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
