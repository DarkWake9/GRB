We observed  the field of  GRB 181110A   (Evans et al., GCN 23413)  with 
RC-1000 telescopes of CHILESCOPE observatory. Observation started on 
Nov. 11 (UT) 01:02:08 in r'-filter and were performed under moderate 
seeing conditions of 1.5''.  We detect optical afterglow  (Evans et al., 
GCN 2341;  Yamanaka et al., GCN  23414; Murata et al., GCN  23415; 
Denisenko et al., GCN   23416; Perley et al., GCN  23421; Bolmer  et 
al., GCN   23422).
