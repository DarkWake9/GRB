SUBJECT: GRB 190320A: Swift-XRT observations

J.A. Kennea (PSU), G. Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), M. Perri (ASDC), P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 190320A at 02:01:48.5 UT,
2831.9 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 117.84887,
-45.88801 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 51m 23.73s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 53' 16.8"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 95 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data does not constrain the column density.
