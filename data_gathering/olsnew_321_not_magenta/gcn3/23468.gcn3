The long GRB 181119A (Insight-HXMT/HE detection: Yi et al., GCN Circ. 23430;
AstroSat CZTI detection: Sharma et al., GCN Circ. 23438) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 14:32:16.825 UTC
on 19 November 2018. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows three main peaks which start at T+0.3 sec and
end at T+15.8 sec. The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM 
data are
15.0 +- 0.4 sec and 8.1 +- 3.2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
