report:

"We have imaged a 7' x 7' region centred on the SWIFT/
BAT error box for GRB 051006 (Norris et al. GCNC 4061)
with the 1.5-m OSN telescope at the Observatorio de
Sierra Nevada starting on Oct 6.105 UT, i.e. 6.0 hours
after the onset of the event) under fair meteorological
conditions.  Within the SWIFT/XRT error box (Morris et
al. GCNC 4062), the co-added I-band image (10 x 300 s
exposure time) shows three sources at the following
coordinates (J2000):

ID       RA          Dec
#1   07 23 13.85 +09 30 28.3
#2   07 23 14.11 +09 30 20.4
#3   07 23 13.61 +09 30 23.7

with 0.4" error. Source 1 is a bright star present in
the DSS-2.  Source 2 is also present in the DSS-2 (blue).
Source 3 is below the detection limit of the DSS-2.

Additional observations will continue tonight (if weather
permits)."
