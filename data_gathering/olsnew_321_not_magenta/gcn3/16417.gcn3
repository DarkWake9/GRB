(U. Leicester), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), B.P. Gompertz (U.
Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), M. de Pasquale
(INAF-IASFPA) and M. De Pasquale report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 7.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 140619A (De Pasquale  et
al. GCN Circ. 16415),  from 129 s to 30.3 ks after the	BAT trigger.
The data comprise 112 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s
were taken while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 16416).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.1 ks) can be modelled with  a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.93 (+/-0.09).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 0.67 (+/-0.05). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.9 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.09 (+0.15, -0.14)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 2.5 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.4 x 10^-11 (5.1 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     2.5 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 7.7 sigma
Photon index:	     2.09 (+0.15, -0.14)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.93, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.031 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.1 x
10^-12 (1.6 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
