NUMBER:  21060
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G284239: Identification of a GW Burst Candidate
DATE:    17/05/03 14:54:04 GMT
FROM:    Alan Weinstein at Caltech/LIGO  <ajw@ligo.caltech.edu>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration report:

The oLIB Burst analysis (Lynch et al, arXiv:1511.05955) identified
candidate G284239 during real-time processing of data from LIGO
Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at
2017-05-02 22:26:07.910 UTC (GPS time: 1177799185.910).

G284239 is a low-significance short-duration burst candidate. Its
false alarm rate, as determined by the online analysis, is 1.26e-07 Hz
or about 4 per year. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

No other GW event candidates were identified within a 300 s window
before or after G284239.

A sky map, LIB_skymap.fits.gz, is available to be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page.  This is the preferred sky map at this time.
The 50% confidence region covers 1029 squares degrees and the 90%
confidence region covers 3593 square degrees.

The GCN Notice and Circular were delayed by more than 16 hours
due to a technical problem, now resolved.

Updates on our analysis of this event will be sent as they become
available.
