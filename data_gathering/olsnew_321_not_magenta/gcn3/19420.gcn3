F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and T.G.R. Roegiers (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The afterglow of the LAT-triggered GRB 160509A (Longo et al., GCN Circ. 19403)
has been detected in the X-ray (Kennea et al., GCN Circ. 19408),
optical (Levan et al., GCN Circ. 19410; Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 19416),
near-IR (Tanvir et al., GCN Circ. 19419), and radio (Alexander et al. GCN Circ. 19414) bands.
No afterglow was seen in the initial UVOT observation in the u filter
(Marshall and Roegiers, GCN Circ. 19412). As detailed in the table below,
additional UVOT observations also show no detections.
All the upper limits are at 2-sigma confidence.

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.31 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
