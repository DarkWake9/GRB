A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), and M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

We report further analysis of Swift trigger #946234
(Bernardini  et al., GCN Circ. 26587).

Using the BAT data set from T-61 to T+4 sec, nothing significant
is detected in the BAT mask-weighted light curves or in
the 15-350 keV image.

No further XRT data are available for this trigger.

We thus conclude that this event is indeed due to noise
fluctuation near the SAA.
