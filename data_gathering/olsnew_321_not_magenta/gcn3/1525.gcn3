At 15:35:15.64 UTC (56115.64 s UT) on 27 August, the HETE FREGATE and 
WXM instruments detected and localized a short burst from the soft
gamma repeater SGR1900+14. This burst is the first event from this source
localized by the WXM this year, and possibly indicates the onset of 
an active period for SGR1900+14.  The coordinates (J2000) of the burst are:

  R.A. = 286.856 (19h07m25s.51)

  Dec. =  +9.14 (+9o08'43")

The 90% confidence error circle for this localization is 16 arcmin in 
radius.  SGR1900+14 lies 11 arcmin from the center of the WXM error circle.

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was ~50 ms. A total of 207 
counts were detected during that interval, corresponding to a fluence 
of ~4 x 10-8 ergs cm-2 . The peak flux was >1 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 s 
(ie >40 x Crab flux).
