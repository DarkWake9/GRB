A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have imaged the entire IPN error box (Hurley, et al. GCN 754)
for GRB 000727 with the NOFS 1.0-m telescope with a
Tektronix 2048x2048 CCD and Cousins R filter.  Conditions
were marginal with poor seeing, bright sky and light cirrus.
Compared against the POSS-II red plate, we reach approximately
the same depth.  Only one, very marginal, object appears on
our frame but does not appear on the POSS-II scan.  This
object is likely just a red star, but is reported here for
completeness.  The J2000 coordinates and USNO-A2.0 red
magnitude are:
  11:45:26.90  +17:22:20.9  20.7  +/- 0.3

The magnitude is based on the bright star just to the south
at J2000 position and USNO-A2.0 red magnitude of:
  11:45:27.84 +17:21:33.1  15.70

A 4.5x4.5 arcmin finding chart for this object is
embarrassingly given at:
