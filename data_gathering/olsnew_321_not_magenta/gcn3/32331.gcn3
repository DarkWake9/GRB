report:

We imaged the field of GRB 220706A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 1114937, D'Ai et al. GCN 32329) with the Zadko
robotic telescope (D=100cm) located at the observatory -
Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 157.6s after the GRB trigger
(123.9s after the notice). The elevation of the field
increased from 18 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.
At the position of the X-ray afterglow reported by
Evans et al. (GCN 32330), we do not detect any source
using a clear filter.
t0+157.6s to t0+167.6s : R > 14.5

We co-added a series of long exposures:
t0+1414s to t0+1962s : R > 17.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 73.7767 lat=-74.3612
