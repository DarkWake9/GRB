SUBJECT: GRB060526: optical observations

V.Rumyantsev (CrAO),   A. Pozanenko (IKI)   on behalf   of larger GRB follow
up collaboration report:

We observed optical transient of GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN  5162, French
& Jelinek GCN 5165, Rykoff et al. GCN 5166) with the Shajn 2.6m telescope of
CrAO between May 27 (UT) 18:27 - 20:05 in R and B bands. In combined images
we detect OT in R and do not detect it in B-band. The photometry  of the OT
and upper limits are following:

Mid time   Filter Exp.    OT, mag.    Limiting mag.
(UT)              sec

May 27.803  R    18x60    20.25 +/-0.04   23.0
May 27.777  B     6x120     -             20.6

The photometry calibration is based on USNO A2.0 field stars. (We note that
R magnitudes of field stars in USNO A2.0 are somewhat brighter (~0.2m) than
those in USNO B1.0). The R-combined image can be found in
