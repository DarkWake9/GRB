report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 01:35:47.79 UT on 27 January 2017, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 170127C (trigger 507173752 / 170127067).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is

RA, Dec = 336.380, -63.400

(J2000 degrees, equivalent to 22 h 25 m, -63 d 24 '), with an uncertainty
of 1.95 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32]).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
by the GBM Flight Software owing to the high peak flux
of the GRB. This ARR was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM
in-flight location. The initial angle from the Fermi-LAT boresight
to the GBM ground location is 140 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 0.210 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is 0.27 +/- 0.09 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 859 +/- 34 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.4 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 in the 10-1000 keV band
is 84 +/- 5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
