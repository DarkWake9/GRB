We began to observe GRB100413 (Holland et al., GCN 10581, Ivanov et al.
GCN 10582) with Xinglong TNT telescope at 17:44:03(UT),10min 35s after
the burst. A series of white, R band images were obtained. No new source
(Ivanov et al. GCN 10582) is found in the XRT errorbars within the
combined 20*20s white band data. The 3 sigma upper limit is about 20.6
mag  derived from USNO-B1.0,at the mean time of 13 min after the burst.


Further observations are encouraging.
