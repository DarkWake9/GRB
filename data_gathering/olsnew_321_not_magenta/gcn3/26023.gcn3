The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 22:58:20 UT on 17 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191017C (trigger 593045905.586428 / 191017957).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 134.6, Dec = 15.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 58m, 15d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
