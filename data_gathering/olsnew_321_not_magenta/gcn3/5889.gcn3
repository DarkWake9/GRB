"We observed the field of GRB 061202 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 5886) with
the robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). A set of
observations was performed automatically in the optical and near
infrared (NIR) filters (V, R, I and J, H, K, z) starting on 2006 December 2
at 08:14 UT, about 4 minutes after the BAT trigger.
Preliminary analysis of the whole dataset does not show any new source 
inside the XRT error box.

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes in the stacked optical R and NIR J, H, K 
images (800s, 600s, 1000s, 600s total integration time, respectively) are:

   R~18.0
   J~16.8
   H~16.4
   K~14.8
