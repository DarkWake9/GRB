report:

HETE Fregate, WXM, and SXC detected GRB 051022(=H3590) at 13:07:58 on 
22 October 2005.  The messages sent from the satellite in real time 
indicate that the burst is both valid and unusually bright.

Because of a dropout of the internet connection to our ground station at 
Cayenne, additional no data were downlinked at the last contact:  if this 
dropout persists, we will not have complete spectral and temporal data 
from GRB051022 until 19h UT.

The HETE team believes that the coordinates distributed in real time
are correct, and we urge that followup observations of these coordinates
be made.

The localization distributed in real time from the WXM was
 
  RA = 23h 55m 53s, Dec = +19d 37' 43" (J2000)
 
with a 90% confidence error region of 14' radius.

The localization distributed in real time from the SXC was

  RA =  23h 56m 00s, DEC = +19d 35' 51" (J2000)

with a 90% confidence error radius of 2.5 arcminutes.

Since the SXC coordinates cannot be independently verified until after the 
full data set is downlinked, we urge imaging of the full WXM error region.
