MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB130313A 27 sec after 
notice and 45 sec after GRB time at 2013-03-13 16:08:56.268 UT in two 
polarizations. On our first (10s exposure) set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within SWIFT error-box (ra=15 45 39 dec=+00 21 34 r=0.05 d).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 15.0 mag.

MASTER II  robotic telescope 
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB130313A 85 sec after GRB time at 
2013-03-13 16:09:36.11 UT in two polarizations. On our first (20s 
exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 13.3 mag. Such a low limit is 
connected to large zenith distance of observed field (z>85 deg).

The observations are continued.
