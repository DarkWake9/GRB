GRB 000528 Optical Observations

B. L. Jensen, J. Hjorth, H. Pedersen (University of Copenhagen),
J. Gorosabel (DSRI), J. A. L. Aguerri (IAC), and A. A. Kaas (NOT)
report on behalf of a larger European collaboration:


"We have imaged the error circle of GRB 000528 (Piro & Gandolfi, BeppoSAX Mail 
## 00/10, 00/11) with the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope. Two 300-s R-band 
exposures were obtained with ALFOSC on 28.90 May 2000 UT. The data were 
obtained at high (2.7) airmass but in fairly good seeing (1.4" FWHM) and 
reach a limiting magnitude of about R = 22.3. No obvious candidate optical 
counterpart to GRB 000528 is found down to a limit of R ~ 21.5 by comparison 
with the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS-2, AAO SES red). The NOT image is posted at 
http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb000528/ ."
