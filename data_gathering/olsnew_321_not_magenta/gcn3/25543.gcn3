report:

Following the detection of desgw-190814j (AT2019nxe) (Soares-Santos et al.,
GCNC 25425) and desgw-190814q (AT2019obc) (Soares-Santos et al., GCNC 25438 )
within the error area of the GW event S190814bv (LVC, GCNC 25324), we obtained
imaging and optical spectra covering the range 5100-10000 A with the 10.4m GTC
telescope equipped with OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) starting on Aug 23, 02:10 UT.

AT2019nxe is located 1.8 arcsec away from the center of the host galaxy and on
Aug 23, 02:15 UT the magnitude was measured to be r = 20.39 +/- 0.07.  The spectrum
(broad lines) is consistent with a SNIa near the maximum at the nearby host galaxy
redshift (z = 0.0777 +/- 0.0005, based on the narrow emission lines from the galaxy).

AT2019obc is located 1.8 arcsec away from the center of the host galaxy.  Cross-
correlating the spectrum (broad lines) with supernova template spectra in SNID
(Blondin & Tonry, 2007), we find a good match to the spectra of SNIa at few days
post maximum at a redshift of 0.216 +/- 0.005.

Therefore we consider that both AT2019nxe and AT2019obc are unrelated to the GW
event S190814bv.
