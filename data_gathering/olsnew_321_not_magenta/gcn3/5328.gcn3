report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:


We imaged the field of GRB 060714 (Krimm et al. GCN 5311) with the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). A set  
of observations was performed automatically in the near infrared (J,  
H, K) starting on July 14.987 (about 8.5 hours after the BAT trigger)
for a total exposure time of 100 sec on each filter.

We do not detected the possible afterglow candidate reported by
Krimm et al. (GCN 5311) inside the X-ray refined error circle
(Perri et al. GCN 5321) down to a limiting magnitude of J > 16.5,
H > 16.1 and K > 15.3.
