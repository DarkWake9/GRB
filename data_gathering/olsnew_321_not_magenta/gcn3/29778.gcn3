A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), J. A. Kennea (PSU) and N. J. Klingler (PSU)
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

Swift BAT triggered on GRB 210410A, previously reported by Fermi/GBM (GCN #29777). 
Due to a telemetry drop-out, no prompt BAT data are available, however XRT has 
localized the source. 

Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA, Dec 269.75417, 45.36339 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 59m 01.00s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 21' 48.2"
with an uncertainty of 6.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
position may be improved as more data are received; the latest position
is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No spectrum from the
promptly downlinked event data is yet available to determine the column
density. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Melandri (andrea.melandri AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
