of the Swift UVOT team

The Swift UltraViolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of INTEGRAL
burst GRB080603A (INTEGRAL trigger number 5283, Paizis et al., GCN Circ. 7790),
on June 3, 2008, at 14:11:20 UT, 173 minutes after the initial trigger in
the UVOT v filter.

We detect a fading source at position :

RA=18:37:38.21 Dec=+62:44:38.40 (279.40921 +62.74400 ddeg (J2000)).

The initial magnitude observed for GRB080603A  is given below for the
first observation in the UVOT v filters:

Filter Tstart(s) Tstop(s)  Exp(s)  Magnitude

v      10389     10499     109.   19.16 +/- 0.35

The magnitude decrease observed was 1.2 magnitudes per hour.

The values quoted above are on the UVOT Photometric System
(Poole et al, 2008, MNRAS 383,627). They are not corrected for the
expected galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.044 in the direction of
the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
