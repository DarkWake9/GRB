TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4199
SUBJECT: GRB 051105A, radio observations

FROM:    Dale A. Frail at NRAO  <dfrail@nrao.edu>

D. A. Frail (NRAO) and P. B. Cameron (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 051105A (GCN 4188; GCN 4194) with the
Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz beginning November 5.80 UT. Within the
±2.5 arcmin BAT error radius we find one radio source in excess of
5-sigma with a flux density of 190 ± 17 uJy at RA(J2000)=17 41 3.19
DEC(J2000) = +34 59 04.1, with (conservative) astrometric errors of
order 1 arcsec.

There are no radio sources at the positions of the four XRT sources
listed in GCN 4195.

Given the relatively large size of the BAT error circle, and the lack
of any flux variations we cannot determine whether this radio source
is related to GRB 051105A. Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."

[GCN OPS NOTE(10dec06): The burst name in the Subject-line was changed
from "051005A" to "051105A" to agree with the contents of the Circular.]
