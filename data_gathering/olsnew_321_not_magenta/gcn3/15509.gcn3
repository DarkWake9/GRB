There are two telescope from MASTER-NET was pointed to the  GRB131122A.

MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB131122A 69 sec  after notice 
time and 76 sec after GRB time at 2013-11-22 21:26:33.898 UT in two 
polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within INTEGRAL trigger N 6392 error-box (ra=10 11 02 dec=+57 
38 22 r=0.054667). The polaroids have RA and DEC orientation on this 
observatory.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.4 mag

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the 
GRB131122A 76 sec  after notice time and 82 sec after GRB time at 
2013-11-22 21:26:39.328 UT in two polarizations. On our first (20s 
exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within INTEGRAL trigger 
N 6392 error-box (ra=10 11 02 dec=+57 38 22 r=0.054667). The polaroids are 
oriented under corners 45 and 135 to the RA axis on this observatory.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.3 mag
