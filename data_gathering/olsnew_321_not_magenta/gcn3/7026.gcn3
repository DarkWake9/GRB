T. Ishimura, Y. Yatsu, T. Shimokawabe, N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) and
M. Yoshida (NAOJ) report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 071020 (Holland et al. , GCN6949) with
the 3-color 50cm MITSuME Telescope at Akeno, Japan from UT 16:21 to
UT 19:53 on Oct. 20, 9.3 hours after the trigger.

In the co-added images of Ic and Rc bands, we detected the optical
afterglow reported by Schaefer et al. (GCN 6948).  Photometric
calibration was done using the USNO-B1.0 (Ic-band) and NOMAD (g'- and
Rc-bands) catalogs.  The results are following:
