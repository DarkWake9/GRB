The short-duration GRB 190706D
(IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN 25036)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=61390.044 s UT (17:03:10.044).

The burst light curve shows a a single pulse
which starts at ~T0-0.3 s and has a total duration of ~0.5 s.
The emission is seen up to ~3 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 7.44 (-1.10,+1.24)x10^-7 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.082 s,
of 2.37 (-0.35,+0.40)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the bulk of the burst emission was detected before
the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.294 s to T0+0.172 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -0.71 (-0.30,+0.36), and Ep = 246 (-51,+70) keV.
