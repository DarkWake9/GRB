The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 03:43:09 UT on 13 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190913A (trigger 590038994.332068 / 190913155).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 264.4, Dec = 18.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 37m, 18d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 19.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 73.0 degrees.
