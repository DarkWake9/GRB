We searched for previous observations at the position of the UVOT candidate (Breeveld et al. GCN Circ. 24296) in archival DECam data which we have compiled and processed as part of the Blanco Images of the Southern Sky (BLISS) project (PIs: Soares-Santos, Drlica-Wagner). The candidate was identified as part of the counterpart search for the LVC event S190425z (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration GCN (Circ. 24168).

We find a faint object <1 arcsec away from the UVOT candidate. Visual inspection suggests it is a galaxy. Its AB magnitude is  r=22.95+-0.096 (MAG_AUTO) at position (J2000):
RA 255.57996 deg
Dec -12.48536 deg
We suggest to observe this object in other bands or spectroscopically to assess its origin and redshift.
