SUBJECT: GRB 111026A: Swift detection of a burst

W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC), V. D'Elia (ASDC),
P. A. Evans (U Leicester), C. Guidorzi (U Ferrara),
O. M. Littlejohns (U Leicester), C. J. Mountford (U Leicester) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:47:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111026A (trigger=506291).  A pointing constraint prevented 
Swift from slewing immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 244.275, -47.495 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 17m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 29' 41"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked 
structure with a duration of about 1.5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 14:29 UT on 2012 January 12. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

This burst is only two degrees off the Galactic plane and could be 
a Galactic transient. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is W. H. Baumgartner (wayne AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
