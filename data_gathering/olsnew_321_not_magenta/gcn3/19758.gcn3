E. Burns (UAH) and P. Jenke (UAH) report on behalf of the GBM Team:

At 01:55:04 UTC on July 31 2016 the IceCube collaboration observed an
event that has a high probability of being an astrophysical neutrino at
RA 215.1090, Dec -0.4581 (J2000) (AMON ICECUBE HESE 128290 6888376).
This position was occulted by the Earth for Fermi at the time the neutrino
was
detected. GBM therefore cannot set any limits on impulsive emission.

Measurements using the Earth Occultation technique around this position
place a three sigma flux upper limit of about 230 mCrab between 12 and
100 keV between July 30th and August 1st.
