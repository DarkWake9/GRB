Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090509 (trigger #351525)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 9325).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 241.426, -28.420 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 05m 42.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -28d 25' 12.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 29%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-4 sec, peaking at ~T+21 sec, and ending at ~T=3 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 20.4 +- 1.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.1 to T+22.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.54 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+20.73 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
