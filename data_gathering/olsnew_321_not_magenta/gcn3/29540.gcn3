S.Dichiara (UMD, NASA-GSFC) and E. Troja (UMD, NASA-GSFC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 210212A (Troja et al., GCN Circ. 29487)
using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell Discovery
Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ. Observations started on February 19,
at 03:55:50 UT (about 7 days after the Swift trigger) with SDSS g, r, i
and z filters.

The extended source previously reported by Heintz et al. (GCN Circ.
29498) and Dichiara et al. (GCN Circ. 29507) is detected in all bands.
We measure a magnitude of r~23.3 +/- 0.2 AB calibrated against the
Pan-STARRS DR1 catalog and not corrected for Galactic extinction. A
comparison to earlier epochs shows no significant rebrightening.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
