Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160506A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 685245) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 62.1s after the GRB trigger
(14.0s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
41 degrees above horizon but clouds were presents in the sky.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+62.1s to t0+122.1s : Rlim = 12.7

Then the observations were stopped due to the bad weather
and start again 39 minutes later. We co-added a series
of exposures:
t0+2366s to t0+3314s : Rlim = 16.7

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
