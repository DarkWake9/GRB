* Rs is a filter designed by C. Schuler which follows Rc very closely.
* Times are midpoints
* Detailed reports (observing equipment, location, conditions, etc.)
and many original FITS files available at
ftp://ftp.aavso.org/grb/GRB030329 or by e-mailing aavso@aavso.org.
 * Lubcke, Hambsch et al., Granslo, Brown, Hohman, and Aquino
used Henden et al. photometry (GCN 2023) for comparison.  
Kereszty used comp star A described on the finder chart by
Rumyantsev et al. (GCN 2005) Durig et al. used comp star A
described on the finder chart by Martini et al.(GCN 2012).
 * Lubcke, Hambsch et al. and Brown have time series data
available.  These observations bracket their datasets.


  The CCD used by Kereszty plus other components of the AAVSO
International GRB network were funded by a generous grant from
the Curry Foundation.
