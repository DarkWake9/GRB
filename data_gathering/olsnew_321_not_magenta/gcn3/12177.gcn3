(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 110719A (Sakamoto  et al. GCN 12173) with 
0.45-m telescope Ïf ISON-NM observatory  on  July 19 starting (UT) 06:54:39. 
We took 30 unfiltered images.  In a stacked image we do not detect any 
source within enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 12176) up to 
19.7m.  The photometry is based on the USNO-B1.0  1245-0023215 star 
(RA=01:38:11.95, Dec=+34:35:52.6) assuming R=13.72.
