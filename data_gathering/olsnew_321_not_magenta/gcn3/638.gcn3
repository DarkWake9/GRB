TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  638
SUBJECT: GRB000416 BRJK observations
DATE:    00/04/18 14:48:46 GMT
FROM:    Brad Schaefer at Yale U  <schaefer@grb2.physics.yale.edu>

Bradley E. Schaefer (Yale) reports:

"I have taken images of the improved (2' radius) error box for GRB000416
(Gandolfi, BeppoSAX mail 00/08) in the B, R, J, and K bands with the Yale
1-m telescope on Cerro Tololo.  Images started at UT 05:18 on 18 April.
At this time, the only comparison is with the Digital Sky Survey, even
though my images go considerably deeper. My images do not show any optical
transient in this comparison.  Further observations or radio images might
yet reveal a counterpart."
