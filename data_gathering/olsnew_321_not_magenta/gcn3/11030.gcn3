larger collaboration report:

"Following the detection of GRB 100725B by Swift (Baumgartner et al.
GCNC 10983), we have obtained optical images with the 0.6m TELMA robotic
telescope at the BOOTES-2 station located in Southern Spain.

At the position of the X-ray afterglow detected by SWIFT/XRT (Goad et
al. GCNC 10986) we do not detect any optical source down to i' < 19 in
the co-added 187 images (60-s each, using an i' band filter, at 20:41 UT,
i.e. 9.3-hr after the onset of the burst).
