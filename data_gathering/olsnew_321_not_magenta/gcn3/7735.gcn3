TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7735
SUBJECT: GRB 080516: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    08/05/16 07:56:46 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 799 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
data for GRB 080516, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 120.64196, -26.15962 which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 08 02 34.07
Dec (J2000): -26 09 34.6

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest position
can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position enhancement is
described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf), the current algorithm is an
extension of this method.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
