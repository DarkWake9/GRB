MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB060213
  (GRB_TIME is 2006-02-13 13:11:09 UT).
First image was at 2006-02-15 20:28:35 UT, 2 days 07:17:25.45
after the GRB time (GCN 4765). The exposition is 30 sec for all images.
Our upper limit on the sum of 20 images is about  17.5 m (there is a 
moonlight). Robot doesn't find OT-candidate in error box.

Our unfiltered images were calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8R + 0.2B).
The JPG-image will be  available at
