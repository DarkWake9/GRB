report:

The optical counterpart of GRB 071112C (GCN 7059) was observed with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey), under poor observational conditions. First image was
taken 16.7 min after the burst. Assuming R=16.0 and B=16.76 magnitudes for
nearby star USNO-B1.0 1183-0043866 we estimated the following magnitudes for
the OT:

18:49:39 UT, B=18.8
18:54:08 UT, R=18.7

During the first hour after the burst the power law slope of the fading OT
flux is -0.83 +- 0.09 in R band and is approximatly similar in BVI.
