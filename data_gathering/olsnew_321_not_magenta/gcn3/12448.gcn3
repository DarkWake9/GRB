"We observed the field of GRB 111016A (Mangano et al., GCN
12439) with 0.5m robotic telescope D50 in Ondrejov observatory
(Czech Republic).  The observation started at 01:59:08 UT on
October 17, 2011, approx.  5.5 hours after the Swift trigger.
We report no detection of the optical counterpart on the
unfiltered images within the error circle given by SWIFT-XRT
(Evans et al., GCN 12441). The upper limit of 19.5 mag in
R-band was estimated using nearby sources from GSC2.2
catalogue."
