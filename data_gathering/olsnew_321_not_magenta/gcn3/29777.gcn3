The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:53:16 UT on 10 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210410A (trigger 639708801.519268 / 210410037).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 268.1, Dec = 47.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 52m, 47d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 50.0 degrees.
