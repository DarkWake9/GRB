The AGILE Mini-CALorimeter (MCAL) detected the GRB 200716C at T0 =
2020-07-16 22:57:41.38 +/- 0.01 s (UTC), reported by Swift-BAT (GCN #28122,
#28124), Fermi-GBM (GCN #28123), BOOTES-1 (GCN #28126), Swift-XRT (GCN
#28128, #28129, #28131), and Fermi-LAT (GCN #28130).

The event consists of two main episodes, lasting ~0.64 s and ~0.26 s,
respectively, which released a total number of 623 counts and 416 counts
in the detector (in the 0.4-100 MeV energy range), above an average
background rate of 650 Hz.

The time-integrated spectrum of the first episode can be fitted in the
energy range 0.4-20 MeV with single power-law with ph.ind. = 2.40
-0.29/+0.32, resulting in a reduced chi-squared of 1.15 (21 d.o.f.) and a
fluence of 4.6e-06 ergs/cm^2 (90% confidence level). The time-integrated
spectrum of the second episode can be fitted in the energy range 0.4-20
MeV with single power-law with ph.ind. = 2.51 -0.37/+0.43, resulting in a
reduced chi-squared of 1.08 (21 d.o.f.) and a fluence of 5.7e-06 ergs/cm^2
(90% confidence level).

The event is also clearly visible in the scientific ratemeters (RMs) of
the MCAL (0.4-100 MeV) and Anti-Coincidence (50-200 keV) detectors. Their
light curves can be found at

The AGILE/MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in
the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in
progress. Automatic MCAL GRB alert Notices can be found at:
