collaboration report:

GRB 121117A (Cummings et al., GCN 13967) field was observed with the 2-m
telescope
at the Mt. Peak Terskol since 6 hours after the trigger (2012-11-17,
14:50:02 -- 15:05:20 UT).
We obtained 3 x 300 sec. images in R and did not detect any source
(reported in Oates et al.,
GCN 13973 and in Nicuesa Guelbenzuet al., GCN 13976) down to a limiting
magnitude of ~21.1 mag
as well as the Indian team observing at the same time (Kumar et al.,  GCN
13980).
Calibrations were done by the same nearby USNO-B1 stars as in Volnova et
al., GCN 13978.
The magnitude was not corrected for the Galactic extinction E(B-V) = 0.06.
