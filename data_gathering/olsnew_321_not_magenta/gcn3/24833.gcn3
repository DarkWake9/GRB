(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 190610A (Palmer et al. GCN Circ. 24783),
collecting 5.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+292.3 ks
and T0+300.5 ks. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected consistent with being
within 187 arcsec of the Swift/BAT position, it is below the RASS limit
and shows no definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the present time
we cannot confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this source are
given below:

Source 7:
  RA (J2000.0):  46.2216  =  03:04:53.17
  Dec (J2000.0): -7.6824  =  -07:40:56.7
  Error: 5.3 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: (1.76 [+0.83, -0.64])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 111 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (1.17 [+0.55, -0.42])e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)


We note that the position of this afterglow candidate is consistent
with the galaxy SDSS J030452.77-074055.3 (r=21.5 AB), which has unknown
redshift. 

Five uncatalogued sources were also detected too far from the GRB
position to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
