Brajesh Kumar and S. B. Pandey (ARIES Nainital India,
on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

We observed the LAT detected GRB 130305A error-box (Cummings & Palmer GCN
14257; Guiriec et al. GCN 14260; Yu & Xiong GCN 14261) using 1.04m
telescope
at ARIES Nainital on 2013:03:05, 18:28:30 UT, ~6.8 hours after the
Swift/BAT detection.

Four frames in R_c pass-band 300sec each were acquired in good sky
conditions.
In the co-added image (4x300 sec), we did not detect any optical transient
within the XRT error circle (Malesani et al. GCN 14263) down to a limiting
magnitude of 21 mag. The photometry was performed in comparison to nearby
USNO- B1 stars.
