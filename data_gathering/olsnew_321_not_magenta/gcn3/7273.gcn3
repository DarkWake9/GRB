A. C. Updike (Clemson University), P. A. Milne (U Arizona), G. G.
Williams (MMTO), and D. H. Hartmann (CU) report on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS team:

The 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope began observations of the field of GRB
080207 (Racusin et al., GCN 7264) approximately 13 hours and 16 min
after the trigger. Observations consisted of 58x60 second exposures in
the R band, under decent weather conditions.

No afterglow was detected within the XRT refined error circle (Beardmore
et al., GCN 7265) down to a limiting magnitude of 20.8 (as derived from
USNO B1.0 R2 magnitudes upon comparison to field stars).
