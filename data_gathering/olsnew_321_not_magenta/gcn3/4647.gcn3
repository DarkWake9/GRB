TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4647
SUBJECT: GRB060203: Observations with SARA
DATE:    06/02/04 04:08:20 GMT
FROM:    Autumn Homewood at Clemson U  <ahomewo@clemson.edu>

T.P. McIntyre, S.P. Fuller, K.V. Garimella, A.L. Homewood, D.H. Hartmann
(Clemson University), M.A.Leake (Valdosta State University), on behalf of
the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team, report:

We observed the Swift location box (Retter et al, GCN 4641) of GRB060203
with the SARA 0.9-m at Kitt Peak. We co-added 5 R-Band exposures of 300
seconds each, for a total integrated exposure time of 25 minutes,
beginning about two hours after the burst at UT02:02:07.  At the position
given in GCN
4644 (Burrows) of the faint, possibly fading, and uncataloged X-ray source:

 RA(J2000) = 6h 54m 3.9s
 Dec(J2000) = +71d 48' 39"

we detect no new sources to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 19.2 mag compared
to the USNOA2.0 catalogue.  Additionally, to the same limiting magnitude,
we find no new source across the complete original Swift error box of a
three arc-minute radius about:

 RA(J2000) = 06h 54m 03s
 Dec(J2000) = +71d 49' 25"

Observations/analysis ongoing.
