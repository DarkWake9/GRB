E. Bozzo (ISDC, Versoix), D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S. Mereghetti (IASF Milano), C. Ferrigno, L. Gibaud (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A refined analysis of a larger IBIS/ISGRI dataset corresponding to the GRB120711A (GCN 13434), revealed a faint emission, lasting for at least ~1000s, after the main outburst.
Being this duration unusual for a GRB, we are at present unable to rule out a different nature for this event (e.g. a bright transient in the direction of the LMC).

The event has been detected also using the SPI Anti Coincidence System (ACS) on board of INTEGRAL which is not saturated and shows a highly structured light-curve at the peak http://www.isdc.unige.ch/~bozzo/lightcurve.dat .

Further observations are encouraged.
