The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North automatically began observing
GRB 120911A (Cannizzo et al. GCN Circ. 13744) on September 11 2012,
08:17:24 UT corresponding to ~70 minutes post burst trigger
with BVRi' filters. Within the XRT error circle (Campana et al.
GCN Circ. 13746), we don't see any uncatalogued object down
to the following limits:

Mid time from       Exposure        Filter       Limit
GRB (hr)            (s)
----------------------------------------------------------
1.37                240             R > 20.9
1.45                220             i' > 21.2
----------------------------------------------------------

We note the presence of a faint, uncatalogued object
in the i' band, lying at 5.8" from the XRT centroid, with
a magnitude of i=21.0 +- 0.2 (calibrated against USNOB1 nearby
stars) at the following position:

RA(J2000) =  23:51:56.06
Dec(J2000)= +63:05:49.2

with an error of 0.6". Presently we cannot make any statement
about its temporal behaviour.
