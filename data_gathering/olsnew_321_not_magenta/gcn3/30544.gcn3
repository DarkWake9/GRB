The short GRB 210727A (BALROG localization: Biltzinger et al.,

IPN triangulation: Ridnaia et al., GCN Circ. 30541;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/210727A.gcn3) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 09:50:46.605 UTC on 27 July 2021.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at
T-0.38 sec and ends at T+0.64 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by
the SGM data are 0.96 +- 0.14 sec and 0.51 +- 0.09 sec (40-1000 keV),
respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
