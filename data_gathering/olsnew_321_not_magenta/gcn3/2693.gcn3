A very bright SGR burst was detected by Konus-Wind on August 28
at 42581.338 s UT.
This burst also triggered HETE at 42569.952 s UT (H3514).
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 317.135 deg, Decl(2000) = -17.624 deg,
whose radius is 42.448 +/- 1.601 deg (3 sigma).
As this annulus includes the position of SGR 1806-20
and Konus ecliptic latitude response indicates
that the burst source lays near ecliptic plane,
we believe that SGR 1806-20 is the source of this event.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a duration of 0.7 s, a
fluence  ~4.0x10^-5 erg/cm^2, and  a peak flux ~1x10^-4 erg/cm^2 s
(both in 20-200 keV range).

The value of the spectral parameter kT for an OTTB spectral model
(dN/dE ~ E^{-1} exp(-E/kT)) was 26 keV.

This burst is the brightest one from this SGR detected
so far by Konus-Wind. It is stronger, than the burst on 040825
(GCN 2665) by a factor of about 1.7 in fluence
and peak flux.
