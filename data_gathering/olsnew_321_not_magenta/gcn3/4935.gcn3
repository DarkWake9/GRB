FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley (UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory) and D. Gotz (CEA/SAP, Saclay),
on behalf of larger teams, report:

In view of the resurgence of activity of SGR1900+14 (GCN 4923, 4933),
we have called two ToO observations of this source.

INTEGRAL will observe it almost continuously between April 1 13:32 and April 3 06:21.

XMM will observe it for 25 ksec starting April 1 15:00.

Observations at other wavelengths, particularly the radio and infrared,
are encouraged.  Observers should consult the INTEGRAL and XMM websites
for any last-minute schedule changes.
