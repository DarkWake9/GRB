K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the
NEAR and Konus-Wind GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR detected this burst at 70956 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~10 s, a 25-150 keV
fluence of 2.6 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s
of 4.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 s^-1.  We have localized it to a 
preliminary 3 sigma error box whose area is ~25 sq. arcmin. and
whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 11 h 45 m 10.54 s     17 o 24 '  34.44 "  (CENTER)
 11 h 45 m 14.07 s     17 o 25 '  11.88 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 44 m 35.46 s     17 o 31 '  24.63 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 45 m 45.47 s     17 o 17 '  43.53 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 45 m  7.01 s     17 o 23 '  56.99 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined.

(NOTE: Ulysses and NEAR have had very high background rates
for the past several weeks due to solar protons, which explains
the the recent decrease in the IPN event rate.  Both instruments
have now returned to their normal background rates.)
