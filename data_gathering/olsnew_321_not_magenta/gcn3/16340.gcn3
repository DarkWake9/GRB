At 09:28:06 the IPN detected GRB 140529A.  Swift was slewing at this time.  A
mosaic of images from BAT event data shows a very strong detection at
RA, Dec 228.816, -41.044, which is

RA (J2000)   15h 15m 15.8s 	
Dec (J2000) -41d 02' 39"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 1.5 arcmin.

The burst consisted of a single FRED peak about 5 seconds long.  The maximum
count rate in BAT was about 5000 counts/sec.

A Swift TOO has been requested.
