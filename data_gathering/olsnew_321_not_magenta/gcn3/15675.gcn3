S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of GRB140103A (Mangano et al., GCN 15656) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations were obtained in the i’ filter at a median time of 11:40 UT on 2014 January 3 (11.15 hr after the Swift trigger time).  We do not detect any sources within the XRT localization (Mangano, GCN 15666).  Using several nearby point sources from SDSS for reference, we calculate an upper limit of i’ > 22.9 mag at this time.
