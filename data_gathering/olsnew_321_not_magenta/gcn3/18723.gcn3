The short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 151222A
(Fermi GBM detection: Hoi-Fung Yu, GCN Circ. 18715;
IPN triangulation: Hurley, et al., GCN Circ. 18720)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=29415.138  s UT (08:10:15.138).

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~0.5 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.20(-0.23,+0.28)x10^-6 erg/cm2
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.048 s,
of 1.03(-0.11,+0.13)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

Since a major fraction of the burst counts was accumulated
before the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.
Modeling the 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(measured from T0-0.434 s to T0+0.094 s)
by the cutoff power law yields the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha=0.13(-0.44,+0.64),
and the peak energy Ep=625(-118,+220) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
