We continued to observe the field of GRB 150518A (Kawamuro, et al., GCN
17825) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir for two further epochs.

Our first full epoch now extends from 2015/05 20.15 to 2015/05 20.47 UTC
(29.94 to 37.69 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 6.04
hours exposure in the r, i and z bands.

For the previously reported SDSS galaxy (Xu, et al., GCN 17829; Mao,
et al., GCN 17830; Littlejohns, et al., GCN 17831), in comparison with
the SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections:


  r     21.27 +/- 0.04
  i     21.02 +/- 0.04
  z     20.53 +/- 0.24

The second epoch of RATIR observations ranged from 2015/05 21.21 to
2015/05 21.45 UTC (55.33 to 61.20 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 3.59 hours exposure in the r and i bands, and
1.07 hours in the z band. For the same SDSS galaxy, again in
comparison with the SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections
and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r     21.40 +/- 0.08
  i     21.08 +/- 0.08
  z     > 17.70

The third epoch of RATIR observations was from 2015/05 22.15 to
2015/05 22.47 UTC (77.99 to 85.61 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 6.04 hours exposure in the r, i and z bands.
In this epoch, we obtain the following detections of the SDSS galaxy:

  r     21.34 +/- 0.04
  i     21.08 +/- 0.04
  z     20.80 +/- 0.35

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Combining the r and i band observations from the second and third
epochs, we find marginal evidence that the source has faded, changing
by 0.07 +/-0.04 magnitudes when compared to the first epoch of RATIR
observations (Littlejohns, et al., GCN 17831). During the full first
epoch of observations, we also observed marginal (1-sigma) evidence
for fading by 0.05 magnitudes in the r and i bands. Finally, we note
that image subtraction between the third and first epochs, in both r
and i band, yield positive residuals in the Swift-XRT error circle at
the 1-sigma level.

Pedro Mártir.
