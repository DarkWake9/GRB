GRB 160814A, localized by MAXI/GSC (Kawakubo et al., GCN 19793)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked structure,
started at ~T0(MAXI)-70.3 s with a total duration of ~ 71 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB160814A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
5.5(-0.3,+0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(MAXI)-11.4 s, of 4.3(-0.6,+0.8)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1000 keV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0(MAXI)-70.3 s to ~T0(MAXI)+0.4 s)
by a simple power-law model yields a power law
index of -2.2(-0.1,+0.1), chi2=1.3/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
