SUBJECT: LIGO-Virgo S190412m: Search for neutrino counterparts with IceCube

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events 
consistent with the sky localization of S190412m in a time range of 1000 
seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-04-12 05:22:24.166 UTC to 
2019-04-12 05:39:04.166 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good 
quality data. No track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with 
the 90% spatial containment of S190412A calculated from the map 
circulated in the initial notice.

IceCube's sensitivity to point sources within the location spanned by 
the 90% spatial containment of S190412m ranges from
0.029 to 0.048 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at
