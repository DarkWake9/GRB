The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:06:59 UT on 8 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191008A (trigger 592211224.080392 / 191008297).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 61.7, Dec = 51.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 06m, 51d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 19.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
