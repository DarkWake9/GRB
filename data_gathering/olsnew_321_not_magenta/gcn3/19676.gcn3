P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:49:03.50 UT on 09 July 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and 
located GRB 160709A (trigger 489786547 / 160709826), which was also detected by the LAT
(Guiriec et al. 2016, GCN 19675). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 48 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two peaks with a duration (T90) of 
about 5.6 s (50-300 keV) beginning 64 ms before the trigger time.
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.26 s to T0+0.83 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.43 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 2211 +/- 131 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.33 +/- 0.09)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.06 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
