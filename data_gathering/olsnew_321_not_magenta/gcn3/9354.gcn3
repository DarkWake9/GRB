D. A. Frail (NRAO) and P. Chandra (RMC) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to image a field toward the
short, bright Fermi-LAT burst GRB 090510 (GCN # 9350, 9334). The VLA
observed at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on three epochs, May 11.48, May
12.48 and May 13.52 UT. There is no radio source detected at the
position of the optical afterglow (GCN #9340). Adding the data
together for all three epochs, the 3-sigma limit is 84 uJy. No further
observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
