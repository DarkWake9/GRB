J. S. Bloom, on behalf of a larger collaboration, reports:

"The Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL)  
autonomously began observing the field of GRB 051109a (Swift trigger  
163136) at 2005-11-09 01:13:55.59 UTC (1min35 sec after the trigger).  
In the first several individual 7.8 second exposures we detected the  
candidate afterglow proposed by Rykoff et al. (GCN #4211) in  
simultaneous J, H, and Ks imaging. Further observations are in  
progress as well as analysis."
