S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), M.Beck, S.Shaw, P.Lubinski,
J.Borkowski (ISDC) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report

From further analysis of GRB 040827 we derived an improved position at:

R.A.:  15h   16m  59.8s
Dec.  -16deg 08' 21''

with an uncertainty of  2.5 arcmin

Note that this updated position is consistent with the one in the IBAS
Alert Packet, but due to an error is at about 5 arcmin form that reported
in GCN 2670.
