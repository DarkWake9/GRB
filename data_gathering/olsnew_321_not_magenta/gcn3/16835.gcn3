V. Pelassa (UAH) and D. Yu (MPE) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:15:13.54 UT on 19 September 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140919A (trigger 432832516 / 140919636),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Gropp et al. 2014, GCN 16831).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle of the Swift position from the Fermi LAT boresight is 34.6 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 109 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5.12 s to T0+123.91 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.80 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 103 +/- 18 keV
(Castor statistics 1085.8 for 610 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.20 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.248 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
