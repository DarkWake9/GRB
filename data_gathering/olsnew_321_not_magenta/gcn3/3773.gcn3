on behalf of the Swift team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=149118) at 18:04:00 UT on 05 Aug 2005
is very likely not a GRB.  At the time of the trigger there is only a
weak excess in the lightcurve and a very weak excess in the image data.

Ground analysis of the XRT data does not show any X-ray source within the 
BAT error circle in 2.2ks of accumulated observations.  We therefore 
conclude from the XRT data that Trigger 149118 is very likely not a GRB.
