report:

We continue to monitor the OT of GRB030329 (GCN  2005, 2028).

The OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985)  was imaged Cassegrain 38-cm
telescope of CrAO.  Several 240 sec. exposures in  R (Johnson) spectral band
were obtained. Based on filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN 2023)  we
estimate the OT magnitude as

Mid Time (UT)                  exposure             OT
March, 31 17:50:40            240 sec         16.92 +/-0.04

Taking into account R=16.8 +/- 0.1 at  18:43  obtained by A. Zeh, et al.
(GCN 2048) one may suggest that light curve of OT starts new episode of
re-brightening or flattering is still continuing.

Detailed calibration and observations are continuing.
