The Swift observation of the field of IceCube 201021A (GCN Circ. 28715)
reported in GCN Circ. 28724 (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/28724.gcn3)
had not finished, there has been 300s more observation time and a fifth
source has been detected. We report it here for completeness.
  
A fifth X-ray source has been found, which is unknown but with count rate
consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not claim it
as the likely counterpart to IceCube 201021A.

The fifth detected source was:

Source no:   5
RA (J2000):  260.56090 [degrees] = 17h 22m 14.62s
Dec (J2000): +14.5899 [degrees] = +14d 35' 23.6"
Error:       +6.5 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 4.3 (+2.3, -1.7) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       1.8 (+1.0, -0.7) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1
