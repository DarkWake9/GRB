SUBJECT: GRB 180805A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1075 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT
images for GRB 180805A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 167.56626, -45.33222 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 11h 10m 15.90s
Dec (J2000): -45d 19' 56.0"

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
