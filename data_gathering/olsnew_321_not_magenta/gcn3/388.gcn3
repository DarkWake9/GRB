N. Masetti, E. Pian, E. Palazzi, F. Frontera (ITESRE, CNR, Bologna),
J. van Paradijs (U. of Amsterdam and U. of Alabama in Huntsville) and
C. Kouveliotou (USRA/MSFC) report on behalf of the
Amsterdam/Huntsville and BeppoSAX GRB optical follow-up teams:

Three 10-min low resolution spectra, covering 3500-8000 Angstrom, were
taken of the optical counterpart to GRB 990712 (Bakos et al., GCN
#387) with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) VLT-UT1 telescope,
starting July 13.17 UT 1999. We detect pronounced emission lines, as
well as some absorption features, that we identify as follows: MgII
(blend of 2796 and 2803) and MgI (2852) in absorption, [OII] (3727),
H-gamma (4340), H-beta (4861) and [OIII] (4959 and 5007) in emission.
>From these lines we determine a preliminary redshift at 0.430 +/- 0.005.
