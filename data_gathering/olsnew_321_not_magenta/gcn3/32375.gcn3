Aaron Tohuvavohu (U Toronto), James DeLaunay (UAlabama), Gayathri
Raman (PSU), Jamie A. Kennea (PSU), report:

Swift/BAT did not localize GRB 220710A onboard (T0:
2022-07-10T03:29:34 UTC, GECAM trig utn220710_032932_GECAMb).

The GECAM notice, distributed in near real-time, triggered the Swift
Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray Urgent Archiver for Novel
Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, ApJ, 900, 1).

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 200 seconds of BAT event-mode data from
[-50,+150] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested
event mode data was delivered to the ground.

The burst is detected in BAT with a duration of ~25 seconds.
The burst occurred during a Swift slew.
The burst position is found with an image SNR of 20.

The BAT position is
RA, Dec = 221.592, 20.657 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  = 14h 46m 22.08s
   Dec(J2000) =  20d 39′ 25.2″
with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin.

XRT and UVOT follow-up has been requested
Results of follow-up observations will be reported in future circulars.

GUANO is a fully autonomous, extremely low latency, spacecraft
commanding pipeline designed for targeted recovery of BAT event mode
data around the times of compelling astrophysical events to enable
more sensitive GRB searches.
