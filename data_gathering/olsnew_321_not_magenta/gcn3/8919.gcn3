SUBJECT: Swift_BAT_Lightcurve Notice for Trigger Number 344565 is not valid

Scott Barthelmy (GSFC) for the Swift Team:

At about 02:38 UT a lone Swift-BAT Lightcurve notice
was distributed with a trigger number 344565.
This notice is not correct.  It is not due to a real GRB,
nor to anything astrophysical.  It was the result
of a combination of a BAT Subthreshold trigger [1] and
a particular high error-rate stretch of TDRSS telemetry [2].

We apologize for any inconvenience.

[1] The BAT Subthreshold operational mode is being tested.
Currently, this notice type is not being publically distributed.

[2] The CRC error rate was 20 times the normal rate.
