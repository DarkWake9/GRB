The long GRB 080211 (Hurley et al., GCN 7295)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=26622.790 s UT (07:23:42.790).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 4.66(-0.19, +0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+5.824 s
of (6.66 +/- 1.22)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+27.648 s) can be fitted (in the 20 keV-2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -0.85 +/- 0.06
and Ep = 356(-22, +25) keV (chi2 = 70.6/62 dof).

The spectrum of the most intense part (from T0 to T0+5.888 s)
is well fitted (in the same range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha =  -0.67 +/- 0.09
and Ep = 484(-40, +45) keV (chi2 = 53.2/62 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.61(-0.11, +0.13),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.62(-1.48, +0.40),
the peak energy Ep = 441(-61, +62) keV (chi2 = 50.0/61 dof).
The fluence of this part is (1.81 +/- 0.11)x10^-5 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
