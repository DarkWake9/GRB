Following the detection of GRB 081029 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 8435), we 
triggered observations with the UVES camera, mounted at ESO-VLT. The 
observations were performed using both dichroics. We took two  spectra 
starting around Oct 29 at 02:06 UT (about 23 minutes after the burst) 
and covering the range 300-1000 nm.

We detect several absorption features, both ground and fine structure, 
namely, the SiII 1253, SiII 1260, SiII* 1264, OI 1302, SiII 1304, SiII* 
1309, CII 1334 and CII* 1335. These features are interpreted as produced 
by the gas in the GRB host galaxy, at the redshift z=3.8479+/-0.0002

Further analysis is in progress.

We are very grateful for the excellent support of the VLT staff and in 
particular to Antonio De Ugarte Postigo.
