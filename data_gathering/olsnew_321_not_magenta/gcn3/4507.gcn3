"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060114 (GCN 4505) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 16:05:57 UT on Jan.10.
After co-adding a set of 33 images (16:05:57 - 16:54:00 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 16.2 mag."
