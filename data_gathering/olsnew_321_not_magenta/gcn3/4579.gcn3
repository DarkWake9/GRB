SUBJECT: GRB 060124: Confirmation of the Afterglow

FROM:    Alexander Kann at TLS Tautenburg  <kann@tls-tautenburg.de>

D. A. Kann, M. Henze & U. Laux report on behalf of the Tautenburg GRB team:

We reobserved the candidate optical afterglow (D. A. Kann, GCN 4577) of Swift 
GRB 060124 (S. T. Holland et al., GCN 4570) with the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt 
telescope under worsening weather conditions (thin haze) in V, Rc and Ic for 300 
sec each, starting at about 20:35 UT.

The object has significantly faded, being near the detection limit of the images. We 
thus confirm the afterglow nature of the candidate we reported earlier.
