A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:27:17 UT on 3 October 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and located
GRB 081003C (trigger 244740438 / 081003.644).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 270.0, Dec = +20.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 18h 00m, +20d 54'),
with an uncertainty of 3.7 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi
LAT boresight is 48 degrees.

This GRB has several peaks, with T90 (50-300 keV) = 67 s and
T50 (50-300 keV) = 31 s. The time-averaged spectrum (8-1000 keV) from
T0-4 to T0+51 s is best fit by a power law with index = -1.41 +/- 0.06.
The fluence (50-300 keV) is 5.4E-6 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; the final
results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
