We observed the field of GRB 140129A (Melandri, et al., GCN 15760) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/01 30.13 to 2014/01 30.23 UTC (23.82 to
26.22 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.36 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.56 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS
DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections and upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r     22.67 +/- 0.13
  i     22.32 +/- 0.11
  Z     22.19 +/- 0.27
  Y     21.94 +/- 0.37
  J     > 21.78
  H     > 21.28

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The afterglow has faded by several
magnitudes in all bands since our observations last night (Cucchiara et
al., GCN 15762).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
