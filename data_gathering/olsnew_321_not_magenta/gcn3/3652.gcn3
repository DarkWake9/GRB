Reichart report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically observed the refined XRT
localization of GRB 050717 (Hurkett et al., GCN 3636) beginning 13.0 hours
after the burst.

We do not detect a source within this localization.  3-sigma limiting
magnitudes are based on 5 USNO-B1.0 stars:

Mean Time 	Integration 	Filter 	Limiting 	Telescope
Since GRB 	Time 			Magnitude

13h 40m		58 x 80s	Rc	21.7		PROMPT-5
16h 01m 	70 x 80s	Ic	21.5		PROMPT-5

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
