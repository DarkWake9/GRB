A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 10:59:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201229A (trigger=1015088).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 210.708, +48.197 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 14h 02m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +48d 11' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 7 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:01:22.2 UT, 111.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 210.6891,
48.1976 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 14h 02m 45.39s
   Dec(J2000) = +48d 11' 51.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 45 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.78
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 116 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	14:02:45.41 = 210.68921
  DEC(J2000) = +48:11:53.8  =  48.19828
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.62 arc sec. This position is 3.1
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
18.19 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.01.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
