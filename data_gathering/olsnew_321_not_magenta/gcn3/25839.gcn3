In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190924h at T0 = 2019-09-24
02:18:46 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 10% of the S190924h 90 c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are
obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions
within the accessible S190924h localization region, from a minimum of
1.60E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.42E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as
spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in
the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in
progress.
