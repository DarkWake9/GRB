Edo Berger (Carnegie Observatories), Nidia Morrell (LCO), Brian Schmidt
(RSAA, ANU), Derek Fox (Caltech), and Paul Price (IfA, Hawaii) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Starting on 2005, April 12.267 UT (41 min after the burst) we imaged the
BAT error circle of GRB 050412 (GCN 3237) with the DuPont 100-inch
telescope at LCO in the R-band.  Two 10-minute images were obtained.  A
comparison to DSS reveals no new sources to the limit of the survey
(R~20.5 mag).  Furthermore, no sources exhibit a clear fading behavior
between the two images to a limit of R~20.5 mag and delta-R~0.2 mag."
