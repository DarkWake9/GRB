C. Pagani (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

We report on Swift-XRT observations of the Fermi/GBM and
Fermi/LAT-detected GRB 140402A (Jenke & Yu, GCN Circ. 16070; Bissaldi,
Vianello & Chiang, GCN Circ. 16069).

The XRT observations consist of two pointings, the first centred on the
reported Fermi/LAT GRB position (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 16069), the
second on the position derived from ground analysis of Swift-BAT data
(Cummings, GCN Circ. 16071).

The first XRT pointing consists of 4.5 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode
data, from 33.3 ks to 51.2 ks after the Fermi/LAT trigger, and is centred
on the LAT position. No source is detected in the XRT data. The 3-sigma
upper limit on the count rate is 3.6E-03 cts/s, which is 1.8E-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1 using a typical flux conversion of 5E-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1. These
data only partially cover the BAT refined error circle (Cummings, GCN
Circ. 16073).

The second XRT pointing consists of 4.9 ks of PC mode data, from 56 ks to
107 ks after the Fermi/LAT trigger, and is centred on the BAT position. No
source is detected in the XRT data. The 3-sigma upper limit on the count
rate is 3.0E-03 cts/s, which is 1.5E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 using a typical
flux conversion of 5E-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
