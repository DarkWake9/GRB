A. Moskvitin (SAO RAS, Russia) report on behalf of the larger team.

We observed the field of GRB160623A (Vianello et al., GCNC #19553;
Mailyan et al., GCNC #19555) with the 1-meter telescope Zeiss-1000
of SAO RAS on June, 27.884 (4.676 days after the trigger).
A set of 8 x 300 sec. frames in Rc band were obtained.

The OT (coordinates reported by Pozanenko et al., GCNC #19561)
is clearly visible in the stacked image as the object
with the brightness R = 21.7 +/- 0.2. This estimation is based
on the USNO-B1 stars described by Mazaeva et al. (GCNC #19574).
