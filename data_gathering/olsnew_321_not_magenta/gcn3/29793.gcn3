Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210410A (trigger #1042113)
(Melandri et al., GCN Circ. 29778).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 269.741, 45.359 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 58m 57.8s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 21' 31.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 55%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED pulse that starts at ~T0, peaks
at ~T0, peaks at ~T+2 s, and ends at ~T+100 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 52.88 +- 4.15 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.00 to T+66.06 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.04 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.74 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
