Dale A. Frail (NRAO) and Derek Fox (PSU) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We used the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) to observe the
localization of the Swift burst GRB 100413A (Trigger #419404; Holland
et al., GCN 10581), an X-ray bright event without any optical or NIR
counterpart to deep limits (Xin et al., GCN 10583; Updike et al., GCN
10587; Guidorzi et al., GCN 10589; Filgas et al., GCN 10592). Within
the revised XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 10584) we detect a
single 8.5 GHz radio source with flux density 159 +/- 15 uJy and
position R.A. 17:44:53.16, Dec. +15:50:03.2 (J2000), with 1-sigma
astrometric uncertainty of +/-0.6 arcsec.

The EVLA is undergoing active commissioning and as such these results
should be considered preliminary. Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
