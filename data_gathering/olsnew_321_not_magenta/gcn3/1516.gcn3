on behalf of the KISO GRB Team report:

"We have observed the entire HETE-2 SXC error circle of GRB020819
(Vanderspek et al., GCN1508) with the KISO observatory 1.05m schmidt
telescope starting at Aug 19.747 UT.  A combined image of all
exposures (3x300sec) gives limiting magnitude of R ~ 19 mag using r
magnitudes of near USNO_A2.0 stars as photometric
references. Comparison with DSS II red images, no new object was
detected down to the limiting magnitude. Also, the candidate reported
by Henden et al. (GCN1510) was not detected."
