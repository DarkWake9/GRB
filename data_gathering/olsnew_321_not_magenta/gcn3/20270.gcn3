 Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161214B (trigger #726885) (D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 20257). The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 3.857, 7.342 deg which is
	 RA(J2000) = 00h 15m 25.6s 
	 Dec(J2000) = +07d 20' 30.7‚Äù 
 with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The partial coding was 64%. 

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, FRED-shaped peak, beginning at
T-2 sec, peaking at T+0 sec and fading to background by T+30 sec. There is a 
soft precursor at T-74 sec, which was detected on board at too low significance
to trigger. T90 (15-350 keV) is 24.8 +- 3.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.42 to T+30.75 sec is best fit by a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.76 +- 0.09. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
