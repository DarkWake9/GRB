Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 171102B (trigger #785510)
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 22082).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 288.096, 22.434 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 12m 23.0s
   Dec(J2000) = +22d 26' 03.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 22%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~ T-6 s and
ends at ~ T+14 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 17.8 +- 3.1 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.18 to T+13.72 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.16 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.3 +- 1.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.51 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
