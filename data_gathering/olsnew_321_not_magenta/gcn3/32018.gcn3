The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:41:56 UT on 11 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220511A (trigger 673969321.870432 / 220511571).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 285.4, Dec = 17.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 01m, 17d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110.0 degrees.
