The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:05:35 UT on 21 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220821A (trigger 682758340.440514 / 220821296).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 133.6, Dec = 28.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 54m, 28d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
