Dado, Dar and De Rujula report:

The very bright radio afterglow^1 of the far off-axis (low luminosity)
GRB171205A at the outskirts of its host galaxy^2 at redshift z=0.0368
(agular distance Da~ 150 Mpc), provides another rare opportunity, like
GRBs^3 980425 and 030329, to measure the apparent hyperluminal separation
of the jet-produced afterglow from the anticipated supernova, which
launched it^3. The CB model relation Ep \propto Eiso^{1/3} for far 
off-axis GRBs^4, and its estimated isotropic energy release in the 
observed 15-150 keV band^5, Eiso~ 5.7E49 erg, yield, in the CB model^3, 
Ep~100 keV, viewing angle of @~(2/Ep(eV))^1/2~4.5 mrad, and a hyperluminal
velocity^3 V~ 2c/@ ~450c.

With such a hyperluminal velocity, the radio afterglow separation from the
SN, which launched it, will reach ~ 200 mas! after a year, easily resolved 
in VLBI and VLA radio follow-up observations.

If the afterglow of GRB171205A was a SN-less^6 GRB, produced by a highly
relativistic jet launched in a phase transition of a neutron star
(to quark star ?), the above estimate will not be valid for the separation
of the radio afterglow from the GRB position, if its late-time afterglow
was produced by a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar^7 (MSP).

We strongly urge VLA and VLBI follow up observations of the radio 
afterglow of GRB171205A.
