MASTER-IAC robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L) ,
located in Teyde Observatory (IAC, Spain),
was pointed to the IPN (Svinkin et al. GCN22864, Kozlova et al. GCN22868) Triangulation GRB180626C / Fermi trigger 551697835 
(GRB_Time  18/06/26 09:23:50.65UT; RA,Dec(2000)=19h 00m 14s +44d 49' 12" (GRB_ERROR: 8.21 deg radius, statistical only  , see 
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/551697835.fermi) also inspected by ZTF (Coughlin et al. GCN22871)
  at 2018-06-26 21:37:30UT-22:53:48 with unfiltered  mlim=19.1 (180s expositions);
2018-06-27 03:34:57-03:53:20 with mlim=19.7 on summary expositions (5sigma, exp=540s).
The observations started on zenit distance = 41 degrees.  The sun  altitude  was -17.66 degree.

MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope located in South Africa started Fermi 
inspection  5834 sec after notice time and 37433 sec after trigger time at  2018-06-26 19:51:28 UT.
The 5-sigma upper limit on our second (180s exposure)  set is about 16.2mag.
The observations started on zenit distance = 89 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 22 degree.
The moon (98 % bright part) is 64 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 69. The sun  altitude  was -52.2 degree.


MASTER-Amur robotic telescope, located at BSPU, was pointed to Fermi 
trigger 551697835 on 2018-06-27 14:09:39UT, and observed till  14:57:32.584UT with mlim=18.0(180s exp)

MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope, located at Kislovodsk Solar Station 
of Pulkovo observatory, started Fermi trigger inspection at 2018-06-27 20:53:26 UT.
The 5-sigma upper limit on our first (180s exposure)  set is about 18.8mag .
The observations started on zenit distance =  6 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 22 degree.
The moon (100 % bright part) is 26 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 68 .The sun  altitude  is -22.8 degree.

New OT, that could be connected with GRB, wasn't found.
