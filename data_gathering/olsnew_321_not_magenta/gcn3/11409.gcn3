GRB 101114A: GROND Upper limits

J. Elliott, R. Filgas and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf
of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 101114A (Swift trigger 438392; Sakamoto et
al., GCN #11405) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al.
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 00:42 UT in twilight and just before reaching the
20 deg above horizon telescope limit, on November 16, 48 hours after the
GRB trigger, and have total exposure of 425 s in g'r'i'z' and 720 s in JHK.
They were performed at an average seeing of 2.5" and at an average airmass
of 2.7.

We do not detect a source within the Swift-XRT error circle reported by
Evans (GCN #11406) down to the following 3 sigma upper limits (all in AB):

g' > 21.8,

r' > 22.1,

i' > 21.7,

z' > 21.5,

J > 20.3,

H > 19.8 and

K > 19.2

The given limits are derived based on calibrating the images against GROND
zeropoints and 2MASS field stars and are not corrected for the Galactic
foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)= 0.19 in the
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
