Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201029A (trigger #1003002)
(S. Dichiara et al., GCN Circ. 28803).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 229.607, 44.473 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 18m 25.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 28' 21.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about 150 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 120.55 +- 9.54 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.19 to T+133.11 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.09 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
