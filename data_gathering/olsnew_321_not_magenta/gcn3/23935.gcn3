P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the AGILE and MAXI
detected burst GRB 190305A (Ursi et al. GCN Circ. 23930, Nakahira et
al. GCN Circ.23933) in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The
total exposure time is 4.4 ks, distributed over 7 tiles; the maximum
exposure at a single sky location was 1.4 ks. The data were collected
between T0+31.9 ks and T0+43.5 ks, and are entirely in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. 

Six uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected.  Source 1 is
significantly brighter than the other candidates and  it is marginally
above the RASS limit, although,  at the moment, we cannot assess if it
is fading.

Details of these sources are given below:
