D. Bersier, J. Rhoads, A. Fruchter (STScI), A. Levan (U. of
Leicester), M. Albrecht (Bochum) and B. Reipurth (Hawaii) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 040730 (Gotz et al., GCN 2634) with
the Infrared Side Port Imager (ISPI) on the CTIO Blanco-4m telescope,
starting 0.11d after the burst.  We obtained several images on Jul 30
and Jul 31 UT in the J, H, and Ks bands.  The 10' field of view was
centered on the GRB position and covering the whole error box (2').

We used an image subtraction technique to search for any variable object
in the Ks-band data.  In this passband the foreground extinction is
approximately 0.4 magnitude. We find no variable object in our first
night data. Similarly, the comparison of the first and second night data
reveal no transient, to a limiting magnitude of approximately Ks=17.6 (5
sigma).
