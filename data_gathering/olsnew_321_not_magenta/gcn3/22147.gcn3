The long GRB 171119A (IPN Triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN 22146)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=85705.835 s UT (23:48:25.835)

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~33 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(4.6 ± 0.5)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 64-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+5.248, of (1.7 ± 0.2)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+39.936 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.84 (-0.09,+0.09),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.71 (-0.69,+0.27),
the peak energy Ep = 232 (-19,+22) keV,
chi2 = 94/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate (measured from T0+0.256 s
to T0+5.632 s) is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.55 (-0.12,+0.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.33 (-0.22,+0.17),
the peak energy Ep = 255 (-33,+32) keV,
chi2 = 122/97 dof.
