G. Kosugi, H. Furusawa, Y. Komiyama, K. Sekiguchi, M. Iye,
and N. Kawai on behalf of the Subaru GRB team report:

We have observed the afterglow candidate of GRB 030913
(=H2849: GCN 2383, 2388) with the Subaru 8.2m telescope
atop Mauna Kea on 2003 September 22.4 UT (9 days after
the burst).  A 600 sec V-band imaging observation was
taken place with SuprimeCam (FOV: 24'x30') centered at
the OT candidate reported by Guziy et al (GCN 2391).
A galaxy (V = 23.0 +/- 0.2) was detected at the position
of the OT candidate.  We also detected a point-like
source (V = 25.2 +/- 0.3) at about 1.5 arcsec north from
the galaxy.
