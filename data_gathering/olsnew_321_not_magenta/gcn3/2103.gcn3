report:

We had been observing the OT of GRB030328 (HETE #2650, Peterson and Price,
GCN 1974) from 17:16UT 28/03/2003 (~5h after GRB) to 00:35UT 29/03/2003
(~13h after GRB). Sky conditions were quite poor, because of low position
of the object (25 degrees above the horizont at culmination). We obtained
about 70 one- to 3-minute exposures in R filter. There is no OT on the sum
of exposures for the 1-st hour of observations up to 17.7 R magnitude (3
sigma). There is no OT on the sum of all images up to 18.3 R magnitude (3
sigma).

It agrees with the powerlaw index alpha=-1 (GCN 1977, Peterson and Price).
