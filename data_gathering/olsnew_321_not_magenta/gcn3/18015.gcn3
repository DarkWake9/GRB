P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:23:00.16 UT on July 11 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150711A (trigger 458331784/150711766),
which was also detected by 
Swift (M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB) et al. 2015, GCN 18011). 
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/XRT location.  

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight
 is 28 degrees.

The GBM light curve is a single peak with a 
duration (T90) of about 14s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-13s to T0+19s 
is well fit by a power law with an exponential high-energy cutoff. 
The power law index is -1.16 +/- 0.07
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 117 +/- 10 keV. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.8 +/- 0.06)E-06 ergs/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.7s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
