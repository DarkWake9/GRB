report:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 190106A (Sonbas et al., GCN 
23615) using the Xinglong-2.16m telescope equipped with BFOSC. We 
acquired 1x3600 s and then 1x2400 s spectra starting at 14:02:39 UT on 
2019-01-06, i.e., 27.9 mins after the burst. The optical afterglow was 
R~16 mag at this time.

 From preliminary analysis, a continuum is detected across the spectral 
range of 3600 - 9000 AA. A few absorption features are also detected due 
to Fe II, Al II, Mn II, Mg II doublet, and Mg I, at a redshift of 
z~0.896, which we propose as the likely redshift of the GRB.
