J. Kemp, N. Mirabal, J. Halpern (Columbia), J. Parker (SwRI),
D. Harkavy (Harvard), E. Costa, & L. Piro (IAS/CNR, Frascati) 
report on behalf of the BeppoSAX team and the MDM Observatory 
GRB follow-up team's southern extension:

"We imaged the BeppoSAX WFC error circle of GRB 990806 (Piro GCN 392)
starting on Aug. 7.19 UT using the CTIO 4m and 0.9m telescopes.
In a 5 minute V-band exposure on the 4m, no new object brighter
than the limit of the various sky survey plates is seen.  The same 
is true of a series of ten 10 minute R-band images obtained on the
0.9m between Aug. 7.21 and 7.42 UT.  No variable object is seen.
The 5-sigma limiting magnitude of the summed R-band image is 23.0. 

Photometric calibration was obtained using the Landolt standard
field of PG 2213-006.  For possible future reference, we give 
recalibrated magnitudes of several stars from the USNO-A2.0 catalog:
