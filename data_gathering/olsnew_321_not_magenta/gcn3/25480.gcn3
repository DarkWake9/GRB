collaboration

We observed the location of DG19wxnjc/AT2019npv (GCN 25393) on 2019
August 24 with the VLA at C band. No radio emission from AT2019npv is
detected, and we report a 3sigma upper limit of about 12 uJy on the 6
GHz flux density.

We thank the NRAO staff for the quick scheduling of this observation and
help with obtaining the data.
