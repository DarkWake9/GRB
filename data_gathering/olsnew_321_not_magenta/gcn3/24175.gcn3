M. J. B. Rosell, Matthew Shetrone, J. Craig Wheeler, Aaron Zimmerman, Chad Hanna, Lifan Wang, Greg Zeimann, and Richard Matzner on behalf of the LIGO Hobby-Eberly Telescope Response (LIGHETR) team report the spectroscopic observation of the field of S190425z (GCN #24168) with the VIRUS IFU array. We sampled a prioritized list of 5 galaxies from the GLADE catalog that overlapped with the LIGO probability map and the observable pupil of the HET. The resulting data cube covers the wavelength 350 to 550 nm with a resolving power of 750. The effective limiting magnitude in the B band was 22 magnitudes. Each field is 50x50 arc seconds. We observed, in order, galaxies:
254.780334-5.741986
254.505371-1.822693
253.245255+2.400985
241.236267+23.932871
247.400574+15.658440
Report of the results will be submitted later.
