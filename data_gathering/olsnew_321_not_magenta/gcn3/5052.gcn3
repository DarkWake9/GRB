A. Cucchiara (Penn State), P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii), D.B. Fox, (Penn
State), S.B. Cenko (SRL, Caltech) and B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 060502 (La Parola et al., 
GCN  5047, Cenko et al., 5048)
with the GMOS instrument on Gemini North telescope.  Observations 
consisted of 2 x
1800 sec exposures with the R400 grating, commencing at 2006 May 2.34
UTC.  In the summed spectrum, we identify an absorption system
consisting of Fe II, Mg II and Mg I at a redshift of z ~ 1.51.  No other
absorption or emission line systems are apparent.
 

We acknowledge the rapid response effort of Gemini personnel that
yielded these data.
