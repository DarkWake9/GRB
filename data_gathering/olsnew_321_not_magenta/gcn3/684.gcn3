NUMBER:  684
SUBJECT: GRB000529: BeppoSAX NFI follow-up preliminary analysis

FROM:    Giangiacomo Gandolfi at IAS/CNR Frascati  <gandolfi@ias.rm.cnr.it>

A BeppoSAX follow up of GRB000529 with the Narrow Field Instruments
started around May 29 at 16:10 UT, i.e. about 7.5 hours after the GRB.

A preliminary analysis of the MECS (1.6-10 keV) data shows a possibly
fading source in the field.

R.A.(2000)= 2.451
DEC(2000)= -61.465

with an error radius of 2'.

A more detailed analysis is in progress.
