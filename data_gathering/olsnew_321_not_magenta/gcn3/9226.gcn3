SUBJECT: GRB 090424: SDSS Galaxy at the Swift position

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and S.T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) report:

We note the presence of the extended source  SDSS J123805.09+165014.6 in 
the UVOT error circle of GRB 090424 (Cannizzo et al. GCN Circ 9223); 
0.1" away from the Swift-UVOT position. This potential host galaxy has a 
photo-z of 0.26. GRB 090424 was detected in the u-band by Swift/UVOT, 
which is consistent with a low redshift origin of the burst.
