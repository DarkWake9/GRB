We observed the inner part of the error box obtained by the HAWC collaboration (Martinez-Castellano GCN #26472) during the follow-up of the GW trigger S191216ap (GCN #26454) with the 152cm Cassini Telescope at Loiano Observatory. The pointing was performed using the R filter. Four 10min exposures have been obtained starting at 18:12:29 on 2019-12-17 (UT), covering a mosaic of ~20'x20'. The observation was affected by bad seeing (4"), low elevation, and passing clouds.

In preliminary analysis, assuming R=14.4 for the star at coordinates RA,DEC(J2000) 21:33:59, +05:16:21.5), for the galaxy #1 reported by Singer et al (GCN #26479) we measure R=16.6+-0.1. This is consistent with r=16.5 reported in SDSS catalog, within the photometric system and filter differences.

No other obvious candidate is visible down to R=18.5 mag and in comparison to DSS2 survey.
