report:

We have analyzed the full FREGATE+WXM data for HETE trigger H3934
(GRB051021.56).

The 30-400 keV light curve has two sharp peaks, separated by about 10 s,
superposed on a gentler rise-and-fall. The burst had a T90 duration of 38s
in the 7-40 keV band, and of 27s in the 30-400 keV band.  Emission in the
2-25 keV band appears to continue for at least 90s post-trigger, mostly
below 10 keV.

The integrated spectrum is well-fit by a cutoff power-law function.  The
best-fit parameters are:

alpha = -1.16 --- 90% confidence interval is [-1.25 -1.06]
Epeak = 94.2  --- 90% confidence interval is [76.7 , 111.7]

The 2-30 keV fluence is 3x10^-6 erg/cm2, while the 30-400 keV fluence is 
6 x 10^-6 keV.  Since the ratio S(2-30)/S(30-400) is 0.41, this event is
classified as an X-Ray Rich GRB.

The pseudo-redshift estimated for this burst is pz = 1.4.
