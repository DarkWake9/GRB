E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"Beginning on March 15.57 UT we used the VLA to observe a field centered
at the position of the optical transient reported by Castro-Tirado, et al
(GCN 612).  There are no radio sources brighter than a 3-sigma level of
205 microJy at 8.46 GHz within a radius of 20" from the location of the
optical transient.  Further observations are planned."
