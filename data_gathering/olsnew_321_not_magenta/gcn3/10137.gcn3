G. W. Christie (Stardome Obs., New Zealand),
S. Dong (IAS, Princeton), A. de Ugarte
Postigo (INAF-OAB, Italy) and T. Natusch
(Stardome Obs., New Zealand) report:

We observed the field of GRB 091029 (Swift
trigger 372210, Grupe et al. GCN 10097) with
the Stardome 0.4m telescope located in
Auckland (New Zealand) starting at 07:55UT,
3.90 hours after BAT trigger. We used a SG530
filter that transmits wavelengths above 5300
Angstroms and a SBIG ST-L-6303E CCD (KAF-6303E
detector).

A nearly continuous series of 300s images was
taken until 16:30UT under mostly clear
conditions (seeing: 1.6-2.5"). These were
co-added making 15 stacks of 6 images (1800s
exposure each).

The fading afterglow (Filgas et al., GCN 10098;
LaCluyze et al., GCN 10099; de Ugarte Postigo
et al., GCN 10104; Marshall et al. GCN 10108)
was clearly detected in all images over the
observing period, yielding the following psf
photometry(DOPHOT):

29.66081   11.910    20.41    0.17

where delT is the mid-exposure time in hours
since trigger. Photometric calibration was
done against USNOB1 0340-0030262 RA (J2000.0):
04h 00m 38.61s,  DEC( J2000.0): -55d 55' 37.3"
assuming R1=16.40.

The mean power-law index over this interval
was -0.94 (+/-0.05). Astrometry of the images
gave the afterglow position (UCAC2) as:

RA (J2000.0) = 04h 00m 42.62s
DEC (J2000.0) = -55d 57' 20.2"

with an uncertainty of 0.18"

This position is in agreement with Marshall et
al. (GCN 10108) and Grupe et al. (GCN 10097).
