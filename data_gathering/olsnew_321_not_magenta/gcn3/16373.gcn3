SUBJECT: GRB 140606B: Swift XRT refined analysis

V. Mangano and D.N. Burrows (PSU)
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT performed a second 5 ks ToO observation of the field of
GRB 140606B on June 09 2014, starting about 273.8 ks since the
Fermi/GBM trigger.
The XRT source reported in Mangano et al. (GCN Circ. 16366) is still
detected. The X-ray position, with a 90% error radius of 2.3 arcsec,
is 1.9 arcsec from  the optical  afterglow candidate iPTF14bfu
proposed by Singer et al. (GCN Circ. 16360).
The XRT light curve shows marginal evidence of decay. Further observations
are planned to confirm it.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
