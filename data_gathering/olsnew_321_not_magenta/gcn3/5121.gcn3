behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) with  the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). Observations 
were performed automatically in the near infrared (J, H, K, z bands) 
starting 62 s after the GCN alert (almost 14 minutes after the GRB).

The first observations were performed at about airmass 6.8, under 
difficult conditions.

Preliminary analysis of the dataset does not show any new source down to 
approximately H = 15.2 at the position of the optical afterglow reported 
by Cummings et al. (GCN 5117) and Mundell et al. (GCNs 5118, 5119).

Further observations and analysis are still in progress.

This message is citeable.
