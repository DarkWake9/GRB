SUBJECT: GRB 200306C: SAO RAS observations of OT
DATE:    20/03/07 01:20:14 GMT
FROM:    Moskvitin Alexander at SAO RAS  <mosk@sao.ru>

A. Moskvitin on behalf of the larger GRB follow-up team report.

We observed the field of the GRB 200306C (Gropp et al. GCNC #27326)
with the 1-m telescope of SAO RAS in BVRc filters. The observations
were started in semi-automatic mode since 2 minutes after the trigger.

We clearly detected the OT discovered by Swift/UVOT, MASTER-Net
(Lipunov et al. GCNC #27324/27325/27327), FRAM-ORM (Jelinek et al.
GCNC #27328), BOOTES-1 (Hu et al., GCNC #27329) with the coordinates:
R. A. = 13:14:13.44, Decl. = +11:16:11.8 +/- 0".5, Epoch = 2000.0.

Preliminary R band photometry of the OT:

Tmid-T0, s   exp., s   Rmag +/- err

151          30        15.29 +/- 0.06
183          30        15.77 +/- 0.03
230          30        15.97 +/- 0.12
276          30        16.14 +/- 0.04
388          60        16.49 +/- 0.05
464          60        16.69 +/- 0.07
541          60        16.99 +/- 0.04

The calibration were done against nearby SDSS stars (Lupton, 2005).
