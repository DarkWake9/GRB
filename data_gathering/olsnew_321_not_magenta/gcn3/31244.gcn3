The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:21:07 UT on 16 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211216B (trigger 661353672.391664 / 211216556).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 100.8, Dec = 60.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 43m, 60d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100.0 degrees.
