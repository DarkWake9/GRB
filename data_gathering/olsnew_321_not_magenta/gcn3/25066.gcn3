report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the trigger time
(T0=2019-07-12 01:15:17.38 UTC) of this high-energy neutrino event 
(GCN #25057), which was monitored without any occultation by 
the Earth. 

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) 
are found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales(1 s, 10 s) coming from the position
of this neutrino event, the 5-sigma upper-limits fluence 
(0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1s:  0.5e-07 erg cm^-2   
10s: 3.1e-07 erg cm^-2 

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1s:  0.8e-07 erg cm^-2   
10s: 5.1e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1s:  2.6e-07 erg cm^-2  
10s: 1.5e-06 erg cm^-2 

Further analysis will be reported in the following circulars.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
