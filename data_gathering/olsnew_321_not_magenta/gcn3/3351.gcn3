A. Gomboc, C. Mundell and M. Bode (Liverpool) on behalf of the 
ROBONET collaboration report: 

"The 2m Faulkes Telescope North on Haleakala automatically reacted to the
INTEGRAL trigger for GRB050504 (GCN3348). The robotic pipeline, based on a
series of short exposures, didn't detect any new source up to R ~ 19 at
3.7 minutes after the burst. The bright source mentioned in GCN3347 and
GCN3349 by Cenko et al. affects our sensitivity over a significant
fraction of the error circle too.
Further observations are in progress."
