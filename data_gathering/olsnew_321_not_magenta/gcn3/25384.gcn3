We obtained spectroscopy of transients located within the error region of S190814bv (LVC GCN 25333). Observations were taken of desgw-190814e (AT2019nqs: Herner et al., GCN 25373; Dichiara et al., GCN 25374) and DESsevhc (AT2019npy; Andreoni et al., GCN 25362) with the VLT equipped with X-shooter on 17 August 2019.

The spectrum of desgw-190814e (AT2019nqs) exhibits clear emission lines of H-alpha and [N II] at a redshift of z = 0.1263 +/- 0.001. The continuum contains significant host galaxy contamination, but is consistent with an old type Ia or Ibc supernova (around 20-50 days post-maximum) whose sub-type cannot be reliably determined.  This classification was determined using DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019), redshift of 0.126, and adding host contamination (Sa-type spectrum at roughly 60%). More refined classification will require further work. This redshift corresponds to a distance of almost 600 Mpc and lies >6 sigma from the inferred GW distance. We therefore conclude that desgw-190814e is not associated with S190814bv.

No discrete features are readily identified in the noisy spectrum of DESsevhc (AT2019npy). The source exhibits a red continuum but no obvious broad lines from a transient or narrow emission lines from a host galaxy. The source does not appear spectrally similar to AT2017gfo.

We thank the staff at Paranal for their excellent assistance with these observations.
