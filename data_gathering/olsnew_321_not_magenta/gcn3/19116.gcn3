Five telescopes of  MASTER Net of   robotic telescope   participated in 
the observation of the GRB 160227A. Two telescopes  detected 
prompt  optical emission. We discovery very strong OT variations with time 
~100 sec correlated with gamma ray flux (Sakamoto et al., 19106).

MASTER-Ural  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Ural was pointed to the  GRB160227A 30 sec after notice time 
and 115 sec after trigger time at 2016-02-27 19:34:03 UT. On our first 
(20s exposure)  set we  found 1 optical transient within SWIFT error-box 
(Siegel et al GCN 19098; Gorbovskoy et al GCN 19099) at a position:
RA   12h 59m 14.13s
Dec +78d 40m 44.2s
With magnitude automatical magnitude ~ 17.3
We definetly see OT  at a number of single and coadd images. OT was 
observed during ~ 1 hours. We see OT decay from 17.0 to 19.1 mag in the 
time interval from 115 to 2647 sec atger the trigger.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.5 mag on first single image and 
up to 19.5 mag at on coadd images in later time.

MASTER-Kislovodsk  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB160227A  (Siegel et al GCN 
19098) 52 sec after notice time and 137 sec after trigger time at 
2016-02-27 19:34:25 UT. On our first (30s exposure)  set we  marginaly see 
optical transient (Siegel et al GCN 19098, Gorbovskoy et al GCN 19099) 
within SWIFT error-box.  OT also definetly seen at a number of coadd 
images. OT was observed for about 4 hours. We see OT decay from 18.1 to ~ 
20.5 mag in the time interval from 152 to 12900 sec atger the trigger.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.5 mag on first single image and 
up to 21.0 mag at on coadd images in later time.


MASTER-IAC  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in IAC was pointed to the  GRB160227A 49 sec after notice time and 
137 sec after trigger time at 2016-02-27 19:34:25 UT. On our first (30s 
exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box. 
The observations started on evening sky (Sun altitude ~ -6 deg). 
Therefore, the first exposure upper limit is very low.  We definetly see 
OT  at a number of coadd images, starting ~ 1 hour after the trigger. OT 
was observed for about 2 hours. We see OT decay from 19.0 to 20.0 mag in 
the time interval from 3400 to 9200 sec atger the trigger.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14.5 mag (due to bright evening sky 
) on first single image and up to 21.0 mag at on coadd images in later 
time.


MASTER-Tunka  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Astrophysical Center Tunka  was pointed to the  GRB160227A 17 
sec after notice time and 103 sec after trigger time at 2016-02-27 19:33:51 UT. On our first 
(20s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box. The observations made on not very well weather condition and 
was finished 10 after GRB, due to snow coming.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 15.3 mag on first single image.


MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB160227A  8 sec after 
notice time and 93 sec after trigger time at 2016-02-27 19:33:41 UT. On 
our first (20s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within 
SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.0 mag on first single image.
