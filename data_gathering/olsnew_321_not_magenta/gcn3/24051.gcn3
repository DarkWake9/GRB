Gaurav Waratkar(IITB), Harsh Kumar (IITB), Viraj Karambelkar (IITB), Tsewang Stanzin (IAO, IIA), Varun Bhalerao (IITB), G.C. Anupama (IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:

We observed the uncertainty region of GRB190404C (Yamada et al, GCN 24049) at UT 18:08:20 UT corresponding to 4.9 hrs after the alert and obtained an r band image of 600 seconds. We find a new uncatalogued source within the MAXI 90% confidence region:

T - T0   |  RA (J2000) | Dec (J2000) | Filt. | Magnitude |
4.9 hrs    14:44:00.896  -22:40:33.02    r    19.62 +/- 0.13 

The source has faded out in a subsequent image obtained at UT 19:47. Further observations are under way.

GROWTH India telescope is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA).
