The short burst from SGR 1935+2154 (MAXI, Sugita et al. GCN Circ. 19545;
Fermi-GBM trigger #488128598; INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7490) triggered the CALET
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 15:16:38.82 on 20 June 2016.  The burst signal
was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T0-0.2 sec and
ends at T0.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 0.16 +- 0.04 sec (40-100 keV).
The light curve is available at

Furthermore, we noticed that the following short bursts from SGR 1935+2154
are also seen in the CGBM survey data.

- 2016-06-02 12:19:30 (Fermi-GBM: bn160602514)
- 2016-06-23 21:19:42 (a possible burst; no confirmation by other instrument)
- 2016-06-23 21:23:36 (Fermi-GBM: bn160623891)
- 2016-06-25 08:04:52 (Fermi-GBM: bn160625337)
- 2016-06-26 09:40:12 (Fermi-GBM: bn160626403)

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center
located at the Waseda University.
