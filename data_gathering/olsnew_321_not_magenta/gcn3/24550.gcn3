The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 04:33:03 UT on 15 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190515A (trigger 579587588.135176 / 190515190).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 137.2, Dec = 39.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 08m, 39d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 35.0 degrees.
