and the CALET collaboration:

The short-duration GRB 160726A (Starling, et al., GCN circ. 19731;
Hamburg, et al., GCN circ. 19732; Frederiks, et al. GCN circ. 19733)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 01:34:08.25
on 26 July 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two peaks.  The first weak episode
peaks at T-0.55 s.  The second peak starts at T-0.1 s, peaks at T+0.1 s
and ends at T+0.3 s.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
0.83 +- 0.09 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
