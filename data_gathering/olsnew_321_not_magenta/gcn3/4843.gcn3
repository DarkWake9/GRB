M. Andreev (Institute of Astronomy), E. Pavlenko (CrAO),  A. Pozanenko
(IKI)  on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed GRB 060218/SN 2006aj  (Cusumano et al. GCN 4775) in V-band with
the 60 cm telescope of  peak Terskol observatory on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.  A
series of 60 s exposures were taken in both epochs.

Using SDSS pre-burst observations (Cool et al. GCN 4777) we estimate
brightness of the optical afterglow + SN:


Mid  time,      exp.,     V mag
(UT)            (s)
Feb.22  17:08  147x60 s   18.00 +/- 0.01
Feb.23  18:20   12x60 s   17.82 +/- 0.03

The brightening rate in V between Feb. 22 and Feb. 23 is 0.16m per day.
