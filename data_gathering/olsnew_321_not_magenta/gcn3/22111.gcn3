The long-duration GRB 171102A (Yassine et al., GCN circ. 21615;
Stanbro et al., GCN circ. 22083; Kozlova et al., GCN circ. 22091;
Tsvetkova et al., GCN circ. 22094; INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7955) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:33:36.14 on 2 November 2017.
The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem
in one of the ground alert processing script, the GCN notice was not distributed
automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows a complex structure with a precursor around
T0.  The precursor emission starts at T-2 sec and ends at T+2 sec.  The main burst
episode starts at T+30 sec, peaks at T+48 sec and ends at T+60 sec.  The T90
duration measured by the SGM data is 21.9 +- 0.3 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
