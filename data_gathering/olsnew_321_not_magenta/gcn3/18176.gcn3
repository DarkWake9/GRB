and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration, very intense GRB 150819B has been detected by Fermi 
(GBM trigger 461673203 / 150819440), Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), 
so far, at about 37999 s UT (10:33:19).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    59.386 (03h 57m 33s) +39.701 (+39d 42' 05")
  Corners:
    59.157 (03h 56m 38s) +40.372 (+40d 22' 21")
    59.671 (03h 58m 41s) +39.060 (+39d 03' 35")
    59.608 (03h 58m 26s) +39.029 (+39d 01' 45")
    59.093 (03h 56m 22s) +40.341 (+40d 20' 29")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 272 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 1.4 deg (the minimum one is 3.4 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 81 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
