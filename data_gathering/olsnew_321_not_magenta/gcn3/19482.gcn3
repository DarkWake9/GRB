report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160601A (Kocevski et al., GCN 19478)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 14:57 UT on 1st June, 14 min after
the BAT trigger, to 15:22 UT. The total exposure of 10.0 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the XRT error circle down to the limiting magnitude of
Ks=16.1 (Vega, S/N=3). The photometric calibration was made
against 2MASS field stars.
