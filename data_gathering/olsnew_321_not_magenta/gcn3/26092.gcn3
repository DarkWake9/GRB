and Y. Xin (Yunnan Nacional Astronomical Observatory), on behalf of a 
larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 191029A by Swift (Evans et al. GCNC 
26088), the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope at Lijiang Astronomical 
Observatory (China) automatic slewed to the GRB position and gathered 
g-band images starting at 11:31:27 UT (0.26 h after trigger, once the 
field became reachable). No optical afterglow is found down to 19.2 mag 
(at 0.9 h median time after trigger). Once the XRT position was 
available, we also took several images (clear filter) starting at 13:38 
UT. No optical afterglow was found down to 20.3 mag (at 2.5 h median 
time post trigger) at the enhaced XRT position (Osborne et al. GCNC 
26090). This is in agreement with Romanov et al. (GCNC 26091).

We thank the staff at Lijiang Observatory for their excellent support.
