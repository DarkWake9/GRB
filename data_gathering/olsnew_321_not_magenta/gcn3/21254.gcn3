and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170606A (Fermi-GBM trigger #518483662)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:14:14.82
on 6 June 2017.  The burst signal was seen only by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts
at T+3 sec, peaks at T+4.5 sec and ends at T+8 sec.  The T90 duration
measured by the SGM data is 3.9 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
