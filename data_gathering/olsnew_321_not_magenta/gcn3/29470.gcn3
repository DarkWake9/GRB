The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:43:18 UT on 11 Feb 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210211A (trigger 634725803.658592 / 210211363).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 283.8, Dec = -55.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 55m, -55d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 45.0 degrees.
