G. Cannizzaro (SRON/Radboud Univ), I. Pastor-Marazuela (API/ASTRON), P. Jonker (SRON/Radboud Univ) report on behalf of the GW@WHT collaboration:

We obtained optical spectroscopy of Gaia19dzi (GCN 25716), an optical transient within the LIGO/Virgo S190901ap  sky localisation (GCN 25606) with the ACAM instrument mounted on the William Herschel Telescope located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. We cross-correlate the transient spectra with a library of supernova template spectra using the code SNID (Blondin and Tonry, 2007). 


Gaia19dzi is classified as a SNIa, with a redshift of z=0.06.
