Ulysses and HETE-FREGATE (H2436) observed this GRB at 32792 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10 seconds and
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.0E-06 erg/cm2.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000) = 0.042, -35.331 degrees, whose radius is 84.393 +/-  0.083
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
