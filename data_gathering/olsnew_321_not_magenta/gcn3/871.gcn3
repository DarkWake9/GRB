"Using the ALFOSC on the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope, we have
obtained 4700sec of further R-band imaging of the Optical Transient 
(OT) of GRB 000926 (GCN #801, #803, #804) on 2000 October 27.
The seeing was 1.1 arcsec.

Near the position of the OT we detect extended emission, which most
likely is from the host galaxy of GRB000926. There are several knots of
emission. One of these knots coincides with the precise position of the
OT. The magnitude of the galaxy measured in a circular aperture with
diameter 5.7 arcsec is about R=23.9 in good agreement with estimates
based on the flattening of the OT light-curve (GCN #840, #850).

A 10.5x10.5 arcsec^2 section of the combined R-band image centred on 
the position of the OT (marked by a circle) can be seen at
