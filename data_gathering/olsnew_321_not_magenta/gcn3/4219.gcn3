K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 The error region of GRB 051109 (Tagliaferri et al. GCN 4213) was
observed by the 0.3 m telescopes in the New Mexico Skies
Observatory. Starting at 01:17:46 UT (326 s after the burst), 120 s
exposures in Ic band was obtained. We also observed the field in Rc
band (120 s exposures) with another 0.3 m telescope at the same site,
starting at 01:29:39 UT.

 As a result of the preliminary analysis, the optical afterglow
(Rykoff et al. GCN 4211) is detected in Ic band as follows, relative
to USNO-B1.0 I magnitude.
