S. T. Holland (STScI) and
E. A. Helder (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

     The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB
121123A starting 131 s after the BAT trigger (Helder et al., 2012,
GCNC 13982).  The refined UVOT position is

     RA (J2000)  20:29:16.30  =  307.31792 (deg)
    Dec (J2000) -11:51:35.6   =  -11.85989 (deg)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.44 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence,
statistical + systematic).  We observe a slow decay of the optical
afterglow, consistent with that reported by Xu et al., (2012, GCNC
13986).  The afterglow is weakly detected in white at approximately 40
ks after the BAT trigger.  However, the UVOT photometry is affected by
a bright (B ~ 14 mag) star (USNO B1.0 0781-0714667) located
approximately 22 arcsec north of the afterglow, so the late-time
behavior of the optical afterglow's light curve requires further
analysis.  Preliminary UVOT photometry, and 3-sigma upper limits, for
the afterglow are presented below.

------------------------------------------------------

    The detection in the UVOT u band, combined with the non-detection
in the UVOT uvw1 band, is consistent with GRB 121123A having a
redshift of approximately 1.5 < z < 3.4.

    The quoted magnitudes and upper limits have not been corrected for
the Galactic extinction along the line of sight to this burst of
E_{B-V} = 0.05 mag (Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJS, 737, 103).  The
photometry is in the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011,
AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373).
