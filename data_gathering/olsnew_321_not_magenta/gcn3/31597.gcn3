H. Kumar(IITB), J. Stanzin (IAO), V. Bhalerao(IITB), G. C. Anupama(IIA), S.
Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH-India team:

We observed ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc discovered by Zwicky Transient Facility
(Andreoni et al., (GCN 31590) and further followed-up by D. A. Perley et
al., (GCN 31592), N. Pankov et al., (GCN 31593) D. A. Perley et al., (GCN
31594) and T. Ahumada et al., (GCN 31595); with the 0.7m GROWTH-India
Telescope (GIT). We obtained multiple 300-sec exposures in the r' and
i’ filters.
The source is clearly detected in the stacked images. The photometric
results follow as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (mid) | Filter |  Exposure  |  Magnitude (AB) |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

2459626.37303  |  r’  |  300 x 6 |  20.46 +/- 0.09  |

2459626.28331  |  i’  |  300 x 5 |  20.08 +/- 0.08  |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The photometric results are in agreement with the decay reported by N.
Pankov et al., (GCN 31593) and D. A. Perley et al., (GCN 31594). The
magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS DR1 (Chambers et al., 2016) and
not corrected for Galactic extinction.


The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) with funding from DST-SERB and
IUSSTF. It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle),
operated by IIA. We acknowledge funding by the IITB alumni batch of 1994,
which partially supports operations of the telescope. Telescope technical
