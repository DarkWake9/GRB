H.-F. Yu (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:03:22.32 UT on 21 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140721A (trigger 427622605 / 140721336).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is 
RA = 175.7, Dec = -41.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 11h 42m 48s, 
-41d 12'), with an uncertainty of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma
containment, statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-pulse feature with a duration
(T90) of about 128 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from 
T0-6.400 s to T0+84.737 s is well fit by a Band function with 
Epeak = 129.0 +/- 10.2 keV, alpha = -1.05 +/- 0.05, 
and beta = -1.98 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.95 +/- 0.08)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+18.752 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 14.0 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
