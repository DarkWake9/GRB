on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 220524B (IPN triangulation: Kozyrev et al., GCN 32117)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=57898.077 s UT (16:04:58.077).

The burst light curve shows two multipeaked pulses
in the interval from ~T0-3 s to ~T0+20 s.
The emission is seen up to ~6 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220524_T57898/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a fluence of (1.6 ± 0.5)x10^-5 erg/cm^2 and
a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0 + 16.576 s,
of (7.4 ± 2.3)x10^-6 erg/cm^2/s (both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+24.832 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range by
a Band function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.31 (-0.26,+0.44),
the high energy photon index beta = -1.96 (-0.76,+0.21),
the peak energy Ep = 249 (-130,+380) keV,
chi2 = 94/97 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
