D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at 31368 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 30 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  8.5E-07 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)=0.654 -35.254 degrees, whose radius is 81.705 +/-  0.108
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.

As the Mars Odyssey spacecraft was in safe mode, with all instruments
off, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
