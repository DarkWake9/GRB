Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 211223C (trigger #1090656)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 31288).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 227.165, -26.878 deg which is

   RA(J2000)  =  15h 08m 39.7s

   Dec(J2000) = -26d 52' 41.0"

with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The
partial coding was 32%.



The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about 20
sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 15.00 +- 5.00 sec (estimated error including
systematics).



The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.01 to T+8.99 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.15 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-06
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.01 sec in the 15-150
keV band is 3.1 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
