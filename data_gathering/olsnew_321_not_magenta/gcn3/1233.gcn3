SUBJECT: IPN detection of further activity from SGR1806-20

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and
S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and C. Guidorzi,
E. Montanari, F. Frontera, and M. Feroci, on behalf of the BeppoSAX
GRBM team, report:

The IPN continues to detect activity which is probably from SGR1806-20.  
The updated event list is now:


DATE	TIME	ULYSSES		BEPPOSAX	KONUS		
____    ____    _______         ________        _____

020117	81788	YES		IN SAA		WEAK RESPONSE
020118	71671	YES		YES		YES
020122	38499	YES		NO DATA		YES
020124  79251*	YES
020125  36444*	YES

*TIME AT ULYSSES, WHICH WAS ABOUT 1250 LIGHT-SECONDS FROM EARTH;
EARTH-CROSSING TIME FOR SGR1806 IS ABOUT 75 S LATER

The bursts on the 17th, 18th, and 22nd have all been triangulated to
annuli which are consistent with the position of SGR1806.  The bursts
on the 24th and 25th are definitely SGR-like, in that their durations
are ~30 ms; there are too few photons in the Ulysses data to determine
their spectra, however.  We are searching for confirmation of them in
the GRBM and KONUS data, which will allow triangulation.
