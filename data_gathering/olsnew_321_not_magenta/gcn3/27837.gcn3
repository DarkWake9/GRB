Z.P. Zhu, S.Y. Fu, X. Liu, D. Xu (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 Senior High 
School), X. Zhang, J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 2005528A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 27832) using 
the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 
5x120s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 15:55:41 UT on 
2020-05-28, i.e., 5.47 hr after the burst.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the enhanced XRT 
position (Evans et al., GCN 27836), down to a limiting magnitude of 
r~20.1, calibrated with nearby SDSS field.
