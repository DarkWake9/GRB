The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:27:21 UT on 5 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200405A (trigger 607771646.555024 / 200405394).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 59.8, Dec = -28.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 59m, -28d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
