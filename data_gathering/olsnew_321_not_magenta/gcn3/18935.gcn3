We observed the field of GRB 160121A (Hagen et al., GCN Circular 18912)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/01 24.13 to
2016/01 24.42 UTC (61.29 to 68.12 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 4.27 hours exposure in the r, i and z bands.

We no longer detect the source previously reported by Watson et al.
(GCN Circular 18924). In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs,
we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limits:

   r > 22.97
   i > 22.94
   z > 20.10

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
