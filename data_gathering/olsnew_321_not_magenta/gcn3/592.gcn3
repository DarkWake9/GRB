TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  592
SUBJECT: GRB000301C - Host galaxy not detected in R (?)
DATE:    00/03/05 20:12:30 GMT
FROM:    Christian Veillet at CFHT  <veillet@cfht.hawaii.edu>

The candidate for the optical transient (OT) associated with the gamma ray burst
GRB000301c has been observed in imaging mode with MOS on the 3.6-m CFH Telescope
in the course of the French GRB follow-up program at CFHT (M. Boer, CESR,
C. Veillet, CFHT).

The R image mentioned in GCN588 has been examined for a possible detection
of the galaxy observed in the near IR (GCN586-587).

Nothing is detected at the reported position (1"E 2"N). The detection limit in 
this area of the field is at R~25.

The OT itself has no significant elongation compared to nearby stars.

"Something" is detected at -1"E 2"N though. It was not visible on the 
previous R image taken on March 3.5 due to a much poorer seeing (~1.5").
Its magnitude (if real) is 24.7 +/- .3 .

Should I add that more deep imaging is needed?...
