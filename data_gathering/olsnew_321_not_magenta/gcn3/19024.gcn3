SUBJECT: GRB 160220A: Swift-XRT observations

S. Campana (INAF-OAB), G. Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU) and J.A.
Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 160220A at 02:19:23.8 UT,
3238.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 236.95167,
-18.56501 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 15h 47m 48.40s
   Dec(J2000) = -18d 33' 54.0"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 97 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.09
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
