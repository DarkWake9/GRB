A.A. Breeveld (MSSL/UCL) and D. Grupe (PSU) report on behalf of the  
Swift UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT started settled observations of the burst GRB081222  
(Grupe et al. GCN Circ. 8691) with the finding chart exposure in  
white, 60s after the BAT trigger. The afterglow is detected in the  
white and u filters at:
01h 30m 57.59s  -34d 05' 41.49" with a 0.5" 90% confidence limit.
This position is consistent with the XRT (Grupe et al. GCN Circ.  
8691), REM (Covino et al. GCN Circ. 8692) and GROND (Updike et al. GCN  
Circ. 8693) positions. The two white exposures show that the afterglow  
is fading with an estimated temporal slope of alpha = 0.85. The  
initial UVOT magnitudes are as follows:
Filter   Tstart(s)   Tstop(s)   Exp(s)   Magnitude
white   60            210           147.4     14.84+/-0.02
white   873          1023         147.4     17.36+/-0.03
u          272           522           245.8     16.32+/-0.03
The values quoted above are in the UVOT photometric system (Poole et  
al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) and are not corrected for the expected  
Galactic extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)=0.021 mag  
in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
