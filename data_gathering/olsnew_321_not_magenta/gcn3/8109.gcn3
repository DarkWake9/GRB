M.S. Briggs (UAH), A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU), report on behalf of 
the GLAST Burst Monitor Team:

"At 17:17:07 UT on 2008 August 17, the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 080817B (trigger 240686228 / 080817.720).

The on-ground calculated location is RA= 72.9, Dec= -11.8 (J2000 degrees)
(equivalent to J2000 04h 51m, -11d 48') with an uncertainty of 7.5 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally a
systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The
angle from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) boresight is 68 degrees.

This GRB was about 6 s long with 3 peaks.  Preliminary spectral results
are that the spectrum of the main peak, from T-0.955 to T+1.723 s
is best fit with a power-law with index -1.07 +/- 0.04.  The fluence of 
the event is 2.6E-6 ergs per square cm from 25 to 1000 keV."
