on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 12:06:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200922A (trigger=997024).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 296.915, -55.204 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 47m 40s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 12' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~10000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:08:02.2 UT, 75.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 296.95425, -55.20245 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 47m 49.02s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 12' 08.8"
with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 80 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 4.71
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 8.21e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White
filter  starting 85 seconds after the BAT trigger. The 2.7'x2.7'
sub-image covers 100% of  the XRT error circle. There is a 14.4 mag
source at (296.95361,-55.20447)  8.3 arc seconds from the center of
the XRT error region. There is a  much weaker source at the same
position in the DSS. No  correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of  0.05.
