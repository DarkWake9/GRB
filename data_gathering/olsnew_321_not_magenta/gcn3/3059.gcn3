TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3059
SUBJECT: INTEGRAL detection of GRB 050223

S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck
(ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS
Localization Team report:


GRB 050223, discovered by Swift (Giommi et al. GCN 3054, Mitani et al.
GCN 3055), has been also detected by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board
INTEGRAL.

The burst occurred during a 200 sec long time interval in which the
automatic distribution of IBAS Alerts was disabled due to the temporary
switch-off of one of the 8 modules of the IBIS/ISGRI detector.

The GRB coordinates (J2000) derived from an off-line analysis are:

RA:   271.4002 [degrees]
DEC:  -62.4739 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

The peak flux measured with IBIS/ISGRI is 0.6 ph/cmsq/s (20-200 keV, 1 s
integration time).
