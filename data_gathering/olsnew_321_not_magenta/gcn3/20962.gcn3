We have analysed 7.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 170331A, from 127 s to 19.2
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 12 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.99 (+0.12, -0.10).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.5 (+/-0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  5.6 (+1.7, -1.5) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 4.7 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.3 x 10^-11 (7.8 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     5.6 (+1.7, -1.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 4.7 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 5.8 sigma
Photon index:	     2.5 (+/-0.3)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.99, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.1 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.7 x
10^-14 (8.9 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
