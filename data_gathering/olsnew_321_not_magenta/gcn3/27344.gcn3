The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:26:59 UT on 7 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200307A (trigger 605309224.181756 / 200307894).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 84.2, Dec = -46.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 36m, -46d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 22.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.0 degrees.
