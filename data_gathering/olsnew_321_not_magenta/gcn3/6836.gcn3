on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Gemini Nod & Shuffle spectroscopy on the host of GRB 070714B shows a 
single emission line at 7165 A.  A photometric redshift based on Gemini 
grizJHK observations with GMOS and NIRI strongly implies that this is 
the 3727 A [O II] line.  This places the host at a redshift of z=.92

The Swift BAT discovery data show the burst to have had a short, hard 
main component of three seconds duration followed by a soft, longer 
duration tail (Sakamoto et al. GCN 6623).  The main component also shows 
a small spectral lag (Norris et al. GCN 6631).  Both of these 
observations are consistent with GRB 070714B being a short GRB.  This 
then would be the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift of a 
short burst.

The observed fluence of 7.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 (Barbier et al. GCN 6638) 
at a redshift of z=.92 corresponds to an isotropic energy release of 
Eiso = 1.6 x 10^51 erg.
