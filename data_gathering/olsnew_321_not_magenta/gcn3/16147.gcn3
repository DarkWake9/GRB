M. M. Chester (PSU), E. Sonbas (NASA/GSFC/Adiyaman Univ.), K. L. Page 
(U Leicester), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), and S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:


Swift/UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 2946 seconds after the BAT trigger. A faint source (19.6 +/- 0.4 mag) 
is detected in the White filter which is consistent with the candidate reported 
by Elenin et al. (GCN Circ. 16143) but not consistent with the Swift/XRT position 
reported by D. N. Burrows et al. (GCN Circ. 16146).  The separation from the XRT 
position is 9.6 arcsec.  The preliminary UVOT position is

   RA (J2000)  197.28546 (13:09:08.51)
  Dec (J2000)   49.84133 (+49:50:28.8)

with an estimated uncertainty of 1.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence,
statistical + systematic).  No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.01.
