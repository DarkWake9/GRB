J.C. Tello, R. Sánchez-Ramirez, M. Jelinek (IAA-CSIC Granada), J. Gorosabel
(UPV/EHU-IAA/CSIC), W. Allen (Vintage Lane Obs.), Ph. Yock (Auckland
Univ.), P. Kubanek (IP AS CR & IAA-CSIC), and A. J. Castro-Tirado
(IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 130508A (Holland et al., GCNC 14607),
detected by Swift/BAT, with the 0.6m Yock-Allen robotic telescope
(BOOTES-3) located in Blenheim, New Zealand. Unfiltered images were
obtained starting 17:10:28UT (94 seconds after the burst, 17.65s after
receiving the first GCN packet). The combined exposure of 120 images of 0.5
seconds each revealed no uncatalogued sources within the XRT uncertainty
circle down to a magnitude of R Mag~15 when compared to the USNO-B1
catalogue. Further images of longer exposure revealed no other sources and
did not provide a significantly better limit."
