TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3365
SUBJECT: GRB 050505: Swift XRT Position
DATE:    05/05/06 02:53:21 GMT

J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU), C. P. Hurkett, J. P. Osbourne (U. 
Leicester) and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT 
team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 23:22:21 UT on 5th May 2005 
(GCN Circ 3360). The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT 
position and the XRT began taking data at 00:09:23 UT on 6th May 2005. The 
XRT was in Auto state but was not able to centroid on the afterglow due to 
low source brightness. From downlinked data we find a uncatalogued X-ray 
source located at:

RA(J2000) = 9:27:03.2,
Dec(J2000) = +30:16:21.5

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This 
position is 124 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3364.
