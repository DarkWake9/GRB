"We began imaging the position of Swift Burst #113225 at 2005-04-02
06:27:42.5 UTC with PAIRITEL on Mt Hopkins. There appears to be be no
object brighter than the 2MASS catalogue in J, H, and K.  In comparing two
epochs, there appears to be a fading source at:

   09:05:55.42, 16:37:25.5 (J2000)

Further analysis is in progress."
