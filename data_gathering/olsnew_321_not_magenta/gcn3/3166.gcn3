S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-
Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have observed the field of Swift Trigger #113225 with the Palomar 60-
inch telescope.  Automated observations began approximately three
minutes after receiving the alert.  We have obtained 3 x 120 second
images in the Kron R band.  Visual comparison with the Digitized Sky
Survey yields no new sources in the field.  We estimate our (3 sigma)
limiting magnitude to be R ~ 20 (calculated with reference 4 objects in
the Guide Star Catalog).

Further observations are planned.
