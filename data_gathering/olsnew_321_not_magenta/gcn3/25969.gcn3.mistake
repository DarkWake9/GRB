The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) around the time of
the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S190930s (GCN Circular 25871).
Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new
sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN Notice, is available
for  retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190930s

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. The 90%
credible region is 1748 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 709 +/- 191 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this
alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide <
