SUBJECT: XRF050522: NIR observations of XRT candidate

Derek B. Fox (Caltech) reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie
GRB Collaboration:  

"Inspecting our near-infrared images of the Integral localization
region for XRF050522 (Gotz et al., GCN 3446) reveals no Ks-band
sources within the XRT localization region of Capalbi et al. (GCN
3463).  Our previously reported limit of Ks > 18.5 mag for the
afterglow at 2.6 hours after the burst (Fox, Erb & Reddy, GCN 3448;
Fox et al., GCN 3457) therefore applies to this candidate.

We note that there is a bright star and NOMAD catalog object located
7.75" (~2.6 sigma?) from the XRT candidate position, at RA
13:20:34.565, Dec +24:47:12.61 (J2000)."
