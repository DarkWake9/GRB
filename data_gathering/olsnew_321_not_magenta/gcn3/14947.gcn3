TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14947
SUBJECT: GRB 130627B: Possible Swift-XRT afterglow detection
DATE:    13/06/28 08:03:34 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) & S.R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

In 3.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 130627B (Oates  et al. GCN Circ. 14936),
from 3.7 ks to 11.2 ks after the  BAT trigger we find an uncatalogued
X-ray sources at  RA, Dec = 181.91308, -55.7008 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 12 07 39.14
Dec(J2000): -55 42 02.9

with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The mean
count rate in this interval is 8.8(+/-2.0) x 10^-3 ct/sec, and we cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
