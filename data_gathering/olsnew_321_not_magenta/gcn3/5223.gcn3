B. Peterson and B. Schmidt (ANU) on behalf of a larger collaboration report,

"We have obtained imaging and spectra of GRB060605 (GCN 5221) with the 
ANU 2.3m telescope
and confirm the candidate of  Rykoff et al. (GCN 5220). The spectrum 
taken with the Double Beam
Spectrograph reveals a strong absorption feature at 5850A with many 
absorption lines to the
blue of this feature. To the red, the spectrum has only a few very  weak 
absoption lines and is otherwise a featureless power law. Associating 
the absorption feature at ~5850 with Ly-alpha gives a redshift of z=3.8 
for the burst."
