J. Gorosabel (IAA/CSIC-UPV/EHU), V. Terron (IAA/CSIC), E. Gomez (IAC), J. Cepa (IAC), M. Fernandez (IAA/CSIC), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the GRB140102A optical afterglow (Hagen et al., GCN 15653; Xu et al., GCN 15655) in the I-band using the 1.23m CAHA and IAC80 telescopes. The images were acquired on Jan 3.2569-3.2670 UT and Jan 3.2719-3.2942 UT, respectively. The afterglow is clearly detected with I~20.5 (vega), calibrated against the USNO B1.0 catalog.
