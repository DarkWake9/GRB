A. A. Breeveld (MSSL-UCL) and G. Stratta (ASDC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 120404A
139 s after the BAT trigger (Stratta et al., GCN Circ. 13208).
A source at the UVOT position given in Stratta et al., GCN Circ. 13208, 
and consistent with the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 
13218), is detected in the initial UVOT exposures. The source is only 
seen in the optical filters and rises initially and then fades. The fact 
that the source is not detected in the UV filters is consistent with the 
redshift of z=2.876 reported by Cucchiara et al., GCN Circ. 13217.

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT 
photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for 
the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic 
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05 in the direction of the 
burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
