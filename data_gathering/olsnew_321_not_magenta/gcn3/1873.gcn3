A. Guarnieri, S.Bernabei, C.Bartolini, A.Piccioni, I.Bruni, (Bologna 
University and Bologna Astronomical Observatory), and G. Pizzichini (IASF-CNR, 
Sezione di Bologna) report: 

On 2003, February 20, 00h38m23s UT we started observations of the error box 
of GRB030217 (GCN 1872) with the 152 cm telescope in Loiano, (R band, 
300 sec exposures). Coverage of the entire error box was performed in bright 
sky conditions because of the full moon. 
By comparison with the DssII, in our frames there is no new source brighter 
than 18.0 mag.
