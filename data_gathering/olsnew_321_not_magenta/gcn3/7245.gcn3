P. Schady (MSSL-UCL), M. Stamatikos (GSFC/ORAU) report on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB080130 (Copete et al., GCN 7242) 
approximately 11hrs after the possible burst, in the v, u, uvw1, uvm2 and 
uvw2 filters. All three 2MASS sources mentioned by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 
7244) are detected in the UVOT observations. No new source is detected 
within the XRT error circle (Starling et al., GCN 7243) in any of the UVOT 
observations down to the following 3-sigma upper limits:

Filter Tmid (s) Exp.(s)  3-sig UL
v      40760    424      > 19.31
u      41979    248      > 19.47
uvw1   41631    424      > 19.68
uvm2   41195    424      > 19.79
uvw2   40324    424      > 19.07

The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)=0.19 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
