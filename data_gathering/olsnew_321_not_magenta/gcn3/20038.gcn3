L. P. Xin,   M. Zhai,  J. Y. Wei,  Y. L. Qiu,  J. S. Deng, 
J. Wang,  X. H. Han, L. H. Li and C. Wu on behalf of EAFON report:
 
We began to observe GRB 161014A (Racusin et al., GCN 20035) 
with Xinglong  0.8-m TNT telescope at 2016-10-14, 12:33:03(UT),
about 100 sec after the Swift trigger time. 
 
The new source reported by  Morita et al., (GCN 20036) and 
Guidorzi et al., (GCN 20037) was clearly detected  in the white images.  
Preliminary analysis shows that  the brightness of the optical afterglow
in R band is about 15.02 mag, calibrated by a nearby USNO B1.0 object
(22:10:31.5, +07:28:47, J2000, R=13.78mag), 
at the mid time of 110 sec after the burst.

This message could be cited. 

We thank the excellent support of the Xinglong 80cm TNT staff, particularly S. Liu
