A. M. Soderberg, E. Berger and E. Ofek report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie collaboration:

"We observed the optical afterglow position (GCN 4105) of GRB 051016B (GCN
4103) with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck I telescope
on 2005 October 31.6 UT.  We detect an extended source in the g and r
filters which we identify as the host galaxy.  In a 900 sec spectrum we
detect emission lines of [O II] and Ne III, at a redshift of z=0.9364."
