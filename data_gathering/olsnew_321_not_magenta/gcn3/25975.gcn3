J.Wood (NASA/MSFC) and E. Bissaldi (Politecnico & INFN Bari)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:00:53.70 UT on 4 October 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered on a bright, SGR-like burst from the direction of
the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (trigger 591872458/191004376).

The burst has a duration (T90) of ~0.1 seconds in the energy range 10-300 keV.
It is well-fit by a Comptonized model with Epeak 28.71 +/- 2.71 keV and alpha -0.30 +/- 0.55.

The event fluence (10-300 keV) from T0-0.112s to T0+0.016s is (7.142 +/- 0.576)E-8 erg/cm^2.
The average photon flux in the 10-300 keV band during this period is 14.19 +/- 1.0 ph/s/cm^2.

We note that this is the first outburst since June 2016.
The analysis results presented above are preliminary.
