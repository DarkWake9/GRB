K. Ayani (Bisei Astronomical Observatory) and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu
Univ.) report:
 
  "R-filtered CCD images of the field of GRB 030528 (GCN 2256) were
taken with a 1.01-m telescope at Bisei Astronomical Observatory.
The Stacked image of 5 exposures (60 seconds each) taken on
15:22-15:28 UT (139 - 145 minutes after burst) fully contains the SXC
error circle (GCN 2256).  Visual examination with DSS red image
revealed no new object down to R ~ 18.7 (based on GSC-2.2 F
magnitudes) within the error circle.
