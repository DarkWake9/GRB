Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), M.G.
Bernardini (INAF-OAB), E. Ambrosi  (INAF-IASFPA) , B. Sbarufatti (PSU),
D.N. Burrows (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 201214B, collecting 5.8 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+27.2 ks and T0+51.1 ks. 

Eight uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. Details of these sources are given below:
