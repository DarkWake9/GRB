P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), G.L. Israel (INAF-OARm)  R. Cosentino (TNG) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060319 (Ziaeepour et al., GCN 4885) with the
3.6 m TNG italian telescope sited in Canary Island equipped with the DOLORES
camera. We performed five minutes of R-band imaging, starting on March 19.16 UT
(about 3 hours after the burst). 

We do not find any new source inside the XRT error box ((Kennea et al., 
GCN 4886) up to a magnitude limit of R > 23 (3sigma confidence) with
respect to the USNOB1 catalog.
