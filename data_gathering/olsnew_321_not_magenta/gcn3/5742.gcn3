FROM:    Adria C. Updike at Clemson U  <aupdike@clemson.edu>

A. C. Updike (Clemson), P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory), G. G. Williams
(MMTO), D. H. Hartmann (Clemson), and K. V. Garimella (Clemson) on behalf
of the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box of
GRB 061019 (Swift Trigger 234516, Guidorzi et al. GCN 5728) at
04:19:06 UT, 3 hours and 4 minutes after the trigger.  Our initial
observations were 14x60 exposures in the R band.  The observations began
at a high airmass of 1.73.

We do not detect any new source within the XRT error box in our earliest
exposure or in the sum of the R band images to the following 3-sigma
limiting magnitudes determined from nearby USNO-A2.0 stars:

t_start (UT)        exp (s)        Limit
-------------------------------------------------
07:23:00            14x60         R > 21.2


The source was not detected in subsequent R,V and I band images of
similar total exposure.
