GRB 070611; Swift-XRT position

M.C. Stroh, J. A. Kennea & C. Pagani (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed the first 1.8 ks of prompt downlinked data for GRB 070611
(trigger=282003, GCN Circ. 6494). Because of an Earth limb constraint, the
spacecraft did not slew promptly to the BAT position and the XRT
observations started 3.3 ks since the BAT Trigger.

In the BAT error circle we find an uncatalogued source at position
RA, Dec 1.9912, -29.7568 which is
   RA(J2000)  = 00 07 57.9
   Dec(J2000) = -29 45 24.3
with an uncertainty of 5.1 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).

The XRT position is 15arcsec from the BAT on board position (GCN Circ.
6494), within the BAT error circle. We are waiting for additional
downlinked data to assess the fading behavior of the proposed X-ray
afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
