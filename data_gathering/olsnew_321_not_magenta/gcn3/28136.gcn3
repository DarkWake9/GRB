Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the
recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis
of BAT GRB 200716C (trigger #982707)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 28124). The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA, Dec = 196.011, 29.636 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 04m 02.5s
   Dec(J2000) = +29d 38' 08.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 57%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows two prominent peaks,
first at ~T+0.1 s and the second at ~T+2.1. Significant
activity is still visible until ~T+90 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is
86 +- 17 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.42 to T+112.63 sec is best
fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the
time-averaged spectrum is1.65 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the
15-150 keV band is 3.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak
photon flux measured from T-0.18 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 10.7 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the
90% confidencelevel.
