E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2001 February 22.62 UT we used the VLA to observe a field centered
at the position of the optical transient reported by Henden
(GCN#961,GCN#962) in the error circle of GRB010222 (GCN#959,
GCN#960). At 22 GHz we detect a radio source coincident with the
optical source. A preliminary reduction gives a flux of 0.70+/-0.15
mJy. Further observations are planned."
