(IKI) report on behalf of the GRB IKI FuN:

Using publicly available data of the INTEGRAL/SPI telescope we localized 
the source of the gamma-ray outburst detected by Konus/WIND (Ridnaia et 
al., GCB 30599), ASC/INTEGRAL and BAT/Swift on August 5, 2021 and 
triangulated by IPN (Svinkin et al., GCB 30598). Duration of the event 
in the SPI above 20 keV is 0.14 s. Its time profile is shown at

The source was detected at the edge of the SPI FOV (15.07 deg off the 
telescope axis). The map of the sky within the SPI FOV obtained during 
the outburst is given at

The coordinates of the source, (J2000) R.A.=294.0 deg, Decl.=21.7 deg, 
are determined with an uncertainty of 0.4 deg (radius). The  position of 
the source coincides with that of SGR 1935+2154. Thus we can confirm 
that the outburst on August 5, 00:08:56 (UT) is a part of activity of 
SGR 1935+2154.
