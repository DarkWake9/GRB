V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), T. Sakamoto (AGU)
and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 04:39:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220708A (trigger=1115156).  Swift did not slew immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 103.118, +72.191 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 52m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = +72d 11' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed several peaks 
with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+36.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (valerio.delia AT ssdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
