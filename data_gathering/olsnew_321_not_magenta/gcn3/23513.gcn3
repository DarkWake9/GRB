Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. Ayala and A. J. Castro-Tirado 
(IAA-CSIC), I. Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), M. D. 
Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ) and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a 
larger collaboration,
report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) automatically responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 181203A 
(Troja et al. GCNC 23493) ~0.51 h after the burst.  At the position of 
the Swift/XRT enhanced X-ray position (Goad et al. GCNC 23494), no 
optical afterglow is detected down to 20.4 mag on a 360s co-added 
unfiltered image at 0.62 h (middle exposure) after trigger, in agreement 
with the non-detection by Swift/UVOT (Marshall et al. GCNC 23505).

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
