J. Schaefer, D. Gibbs, M. Nysewander, R. Canterna, and D. Reichart report
on behalf of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We imaged the entire 314 sq arcmin error box of the IPN burst, GRB 030413
(Hurley et al. GCN 2135) with the UWYO 0.6m Red Buttes Observatory (RBO)
Telescope beginning 21.701 hours after the burst (April 14.2199 UT).  We
integrated in Rc for 1200s in five pointings.

Visual comparison to the DSS reveals no optical transient.  Through
calibration to five USNO A-2.0 stars, we estimate the (S/N=3) limiting
magnitude to be Rc=19.2.
