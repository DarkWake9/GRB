The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On Mon 23 Apr 18 02:29:12 UT IceCube issued an alert
( https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/71165249_130949.amon ) 
reporting the detection of a a track-like, very-high-energy-event.
The event was identified by the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) selection.
Initial localization reported was RA, Dec: 294.8820, 71.9530 deg (J2000)
with an online estimate of the 90% PSF uncertainty of 8.9 deg.

Visual inspection reveals that the event is the coincidence of a down-going
background muon track and a cascade. The fast online HESE event
selection does not have the ability to cut away such coincident events.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu .
