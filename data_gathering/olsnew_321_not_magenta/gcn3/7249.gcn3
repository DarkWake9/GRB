At 08:44:37.44 UT on February 4, BAT triggered on AX J1749.1-2639
(trigger #302454). The source was not identified on board (it is
not in the onboard catalog) and was misidentified in the GCN
notice as GX 3+1. The spacecraft did not slew, because the source
is still in Moon constraint, though it is now out of Sun constraint.

AX J1749.1-2639 continues to increase slowly in brightness (see 
Krimm et al. ATEL #1376) and is now at ~150 milliCrab. The source
will be out of Moon constraint for the Swift narrow field
instruments on February 5.
