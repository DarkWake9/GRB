A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 190728A (The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 25181)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 585988241) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 23437 s UT (06:30:37).

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=82.621 deg (05h 30m 29s) Dec(2000)=-46.530 deg (-46d 31' 49"), 
whose radius is 86.613 +/- 1.356 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the 
Fermi GBM one.

This localization may be improved.

This burst is spatially and temporally (occurred ~14 min before) 
inconsistent with LIGO/Virgo S190728q.
