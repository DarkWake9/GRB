We have analysed the data obtained using the MUSE instrument, mounted on the ESO VLT UT4 (Yepun) telescope in Paranal, of the Fermi GRB 180703A (Racusin et al., GCN #22883; Poolakkil &  Meegan, GCN #22896). MUSE is an integral-field-unit spectrograph which covers a field of view of up to ~1 arcmin**2. Our observations started on 2018 July 04 at 07:53:56 UT, 10.92 hr after the GRB detection, and consisted of four exposures of 250 s each.

When we integrate the data cube along the full MUSE wavelength range, we detect a source within the uncertainty of the Swift/XRT afterglow position (Gibson et al., GCN #22891), and consistent with the position of the reported optical counterpart (Guidorzi et al., GCN #22892, #22944). We extracted a spectrum of this source within the wavelength range 4750-9350 AA. The spectrum is noisy, and we cannot confirm continuum afterglow emission. However, we identify three strong emission lines which can be consistently interpreted as [O III] 4960,5008 AA and [O II] 3727/29 AA at a common redshift of z = 0.6678. Given the spatial coincidence with the optical counterpart, we propose that these features come from the GRB host galaxy and we conclude that this is the redshift of GRB 180703A.
