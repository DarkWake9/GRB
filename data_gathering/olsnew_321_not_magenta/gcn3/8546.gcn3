Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge (NASA/MSFC) and Valerie Connaughton (UAH)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:35:27.5 UT on 21 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered on GRB 081121 (trigger 248992528/ 081121.858). This burst
triggered Swift-BAT 4 seconds later (Oates et al 2008, GCN 8537) and an
optical counterpart was detected with ROTSE-III (Yuan et al. 2008,
GCN 8536). The burst direction was 135 degrees from the Fermi pointing-axis
so the Fermi GBM sensitivity to this GRB is limited. Further analysis
is necessary to provide meaningful spectral information about this burst.

Final spectral analysis results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
