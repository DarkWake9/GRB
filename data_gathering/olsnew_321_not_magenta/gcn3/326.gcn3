G. Gennaro (OCC, Telespazio, Rome), F. Frontera (University of Ferrara,
Ferrara), report:

The BeppoSAX NFIs observed the region of GRB990510 (see also GCN 311) from
May 10.70 to May 12.22 UT, i.e. 8 to 44.5 hours after the BATSE trigger,
with a total MECS on source exposure time of 68 ksec.

We confirm that the strong X-ray source reported in GCN 311 is the X-ray
afterglow, and is designated as 1SAX J1338.1-8030. The position as derived
from the MECS observations (RA = 13 38 11, Dec = -80 29 58, J2000, 1
arcmin error radius) is consistent with both the WFC GRB position (IAUC
7160) and that for the optical afterglow source (GCN 310). The X-ray
afterglow decay light curve is not unlike that seen in previous X-ray
afterglow decays. We note that a previously uncatalogued weak (constant)
X-ray source lies about 3 arcmin away from the X-ray afterglow source,
with coordinates RA = 13 37 51, Dec = -80 26 53 (J2000, 1 arcmin error
radius), which we designate 1SAX J1337.8-8027.
