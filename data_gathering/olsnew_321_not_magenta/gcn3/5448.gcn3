Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060814 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 224552) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 21.5s after the GRB trigger
(6s after the notice). 3 first images were recorded
during the gamma propt emission.

The field elevation decreased from 11 degrees
above horizon and weather conditions were good.

Date of trigger : t0 = 2006-08-14T23:02:18.816

First image is 60s exposure trailed. No OT is visible:
t0+21.5s to t0+81.5s : R > 14.8

Second image is 30s exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+88s to t0+118s : R > 15.7

Third image is 30s exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+125s to t0+155s : R > 15.7

Fourth image is 30s exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+161s to t0+191s : R > 15.7

We co-added a series of exposures. No OT is visible:
t0+88s to t0+228s : R > 17.4

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars

Galactic coordinates are lon= 24.9891 lat=+63.2011
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.1 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
