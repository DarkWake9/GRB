Ron Remillard (MIT), Jean Swank (GSFC), and Alan Levine (MIT)
report for the RXTE/ASM team at MIT and NASA/GSFC

The RXTE All-Sky Monitor detected GRB050724 in a single camera (SSC 2)
with a significance of 9.5 sigma.  The event duration is 2.0 (0.5) s,
and the burst (integrated) is detected in each of the 3
standard ASM energy bands: 1.5-3, 3-5, and 5-12 keV. When plotted at
32 ms time resolution, the instantaneous maximum is 10.8 (3.0) Crab.
Despite weak statistics, the burst profile appears to show
two peaks, as reported in GCN Circular 3667, and both peaks are 
stronger at 5-12 keV, compared to 2-5 keV 
(see http://xte.mit.edu/~rr/grb050724_32ms.ps).
