"A series of R-band images for GRB 071112C field (Perri et al., GCN
7059) were taken with 300 sec exposure using Lulin 1-m telescope. The
afterglow was detected clearly in our R-band combined
image. Comparison with nearby USNOB stars, the brightness of afterglow
is 22.7 +/- 0.2 at 0.806 days after the burst. This measurement is
consistent with the extrapolation from the RTT150 observations
(Burenin et al., GCN 7066) and implies no temporal break during our
two epochs of R-band observations (Chen et al.; GCN7067)."
