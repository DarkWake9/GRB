We report the photometric measurements of the Type II supernova
ZTF19acykzsk/AT2019wqj previously associated with the gravitational
wave event S191213g (GCN #26402, #26424) using the Lulin One-meter
Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan. The observations were conducted using g, r,
i filters starting at 2019-12-14 10:13:37 UT and were repeated 7 hours
later. Preliminary photometry was obtained by calibrating with the
APASS catalog.

Its r magnitude is slightly fainter than the observation by Andreoni
et al. (GCN #26424) ~14hr earlier and suggests a slow decay. We
confirm the report from Andreoni of a red color g-r=0.26.

We would like to thank the staff in Lulin Observatory for helping the
observations.
