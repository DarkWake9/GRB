T. Sakamoto (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

At 15:54:52 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060124 (trigger=178750).
The spacecraft slewed immediately. The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 77.043d,+69.709d {05h 08m 10s,+69d 42' 33"} (J2000), with an 
uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows an
~30-sec duration with at least two peaks.  The peak count rate was ~1700 
counts/sec
(15-350 keV) at the trigger time.

XRT began observing the field at 15:56:38, 106 sec after the BAT trigger.
No source was found by the onboard centroiding algorithm.  The lightcurve has a
hint of a fading source, but more data are needed in order to assess the 
presence
of a source in the field.

No UVOT data are available at this time.
