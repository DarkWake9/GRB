We report photometry and historical detections of the transient candidate Gaia19boq AT2019egk (Kostrzewa-Rutkowska et al., GCN 24344).  

Previous detections are reported in the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 2 database (Chambers et al., 2016) at coordinates consistent with Gaia19boq, suggesting outburst history. 

The following table summarizes the ZTF photometry of the source on the days near the gravitational wave event S190426c (LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 24237).

The Gaia19boq transient, dubbed also ZTF19aaslxmg, shows red color and rapid evolution within 2 days after the gravitational wave event S190426c (LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 24237).  The red color could be due to high Galactic extinction E(B-V) = 0.9733 magnitudes (Schlafly & Finkbeiner, 2011).  

We conclude that Gaia19boq AT2019egk is a Galactic variable source unrelated with the gravitational wave event S190426c (LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 24237).
