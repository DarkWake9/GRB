Rupak Roy, Brajesh Kumar, S. B. Pandey and Brijesh Kumar (ARIES,
NainiTal, India, on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).
We performed BVRI photometric observation of Swift GRB 090424
(Cannizzo, J. K. et al., GCN 9223) on 24th April, 2009 at 16.7 hrs UT,
under moderate sky conditions,
using 1.04 m Sampurnanand Optical telescope at ARIES, Nainital. The
same field was again observed on next day, about 29 hrs after the
burst in R and I bands.
Fading nature of the afterglow is clearly visible in all bands. The
R_c and I_c band magnitudes of OT, with respect to nearby USNO-B1
stars, are 18.5 +/- 0.05 and 17.8 +/-
0.06 respectively, measured 2.67 hrs after the burst. Further analysis
is under progress.
