R. J. Cool, J. J. Schaefer (University of Wyoming) reporting on behalf of 
the University of Wyoming GRB Response Team under the direction of R. 
Canterna:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004 (GCN #1564) with the 
Red Buttes Observatory 0.6 meter telescope, operated through the 
University of Wyoming, between 4:37 UT and 6:25 UT on October 5 2002.  
All observations were completed in the R-band under unfavorable
conditions. 

We find R-band magnitudes for two epochs:

     UT          R_mag
     ====================== 
     04:52:36   19.14
     06:20:25   19.23

Typical errors on these values are +/- 0.1 mag.  Calibration was completed 
assuming the USNO star from Weidinger (GCN #1573) has an R magnitude of 
15.64.  Further analysis and observations are scheduled in the coming 
days.
