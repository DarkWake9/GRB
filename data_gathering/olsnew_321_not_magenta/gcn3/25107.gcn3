The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We performed a preliminary follow-up investigation of the compact
binary merger candidate S190718y reported in GCN 25087. We removed
glitches reported therein, using the PyCBC [1] gating method and
reanalyzed the data with PyCBC / Bayestar [2], and also using the same
template as the gstlal event. The analysis yields no evidence for
retracting this event. There are no updates to the p_astro or
significance of this event at this time.
