At 03:09:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050223.  Because of the Earth-limb constraint,
the spacecraft could not immediately slew to the burst location.
The location became unconstrained at T+35 min, and the spacecraft slewed.
The XRT and UVOT instruments then began their standard set of pre-programmed
observing sequences.

Using the time interval of the burst, the ground-calculated location
is RA, Dec 271.390, -62.481 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 36 degrees off the BAT boresight (70% encoding).

The burst lightcurve has several small, short peaks on top of a slow rise 
and fall with a T90 duration of ~23 sec (and T50 is 10 sec). The 
peak flux is 0.8 ph/cm2/sec for a 1-sec interval (15-350 keV).  Using 
a simple power law model, the fluence is 7.4 e-7 erg/cm^2 (15-350 keV).
