Observatory Team:

At 12:46:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200701A (trigger=980421).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to a Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 123.555, -14.494 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 14m 13s
   Dec(J2000) = -14d 29' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 06:11 UT on 2020 September 07. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. G. Bernardini (grazia.bernardini AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
