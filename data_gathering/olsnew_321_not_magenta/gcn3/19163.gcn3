D. Xu (NAOC/CAS) reports on behalf of a collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160310A (Vianello et al., GCN 19158) using 
the LCOGT 1-m located at Sutherland, South Africa. Observations started 
at 18:57:18 UT on 2016-03-10 (i.e., 18.75 hr after the burst) and 2x300s 
frames were obtained in R- and I-band each.

No credible source is detected within or at the edge of the error circle 
of  the XRT Source 2 reported in Gibson et al. (GCN 19162), down to 
limiting magnitudes of R~20.0 and I~18.6, respectively.
