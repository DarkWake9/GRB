NUMBER:  17476
SUBJECT: GRB 150219A: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    15/02/19 13:30:46 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@iasf-milano.inaf.it>

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo 
(ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 60 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:31:14 UT of February 19

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 271.2664  deg
DEC.=  -41.5849 deg

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 1.4 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 4e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
