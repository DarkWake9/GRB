Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180614A (trigger #841548)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 22780).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 3.073, 46.969 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  00h 12m 17.6s
  Dec(J2000) = +46d 58' 07.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-4 s and ends at ~T+3 s. The main peak occurs at ~T+2 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 7.04 +- 0.92 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.35 to T+3.45 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.53 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.56 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
