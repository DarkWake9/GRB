Using the data set from T-240 to T+180 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190110A (trigger #883012)
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN Circ. 23670).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 276.939, -53.643 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  18h 27m 45.3s
  Dec(J2000) = -53d 38' 34.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 43%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks that starts at
~ T-1 s and ends at ~ T+11 s. The main peak occurs at ~T+5 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 9.3 +- 0.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+11.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.66 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.66 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 9.0 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
