A possible short-duration GRB160307A (trigger #1141348444) triggered the CALET 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 01:18:34.96 on 7 March 2016.  The burst signal 
was detected by SGM instrument.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts and peaks 
at T0-0.3 sec and ends at T0+0.2 sec.   The T90 duration measured by the SGM data 
is 0.4 +- 0.2 sec (40-1000 keV). 

Identification of this possible short event by other spacecraft is strongly encouraged.  

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
