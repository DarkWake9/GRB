XRT team:

The Swift XRT has continued to  monitor the X-ray source (designated SWIFT 
J113746.1+404754) discussed in GCN 3027 (Page et al. 2005) in the field of 
GRB 050215b.  We now have data over two epochs, indicating a decaying light 
curve for this object.

First epoch:
	We obtained 5155 seconds of data in Photon-Counting mode (our most 
sensitive observing mode) from six orbits beginning at 04:09:52 UT on 
2005-02-15.  The average count rate for SWIFT J113746.1+404754 in the first 
two orbits is 0.0231 +/- 0.0050 cps (0.2-10 keV).  The average count rate 
for this source over orbits 3-6 is 0.0108 +/- 0.0018 cps, consistent with a 
decreasing rate.

Second epoch:
	We obtained 1640 seconds on SWIFT J113746.1+404754 between 01:36:37 UT and 
09:39:42 UT on 2005-02-17 in Photon-Counting mode.  The source is 
undetectable in this second epoch, with a 95% confidence upper limit on the 
count rate of 0.0018 cps (0.2-10 keV, calculated using the method of Kraft, 
Burrows, and Nousek 1993, ApJ, 1991, 374, 344).

The fading count rate suggests that this source could be the X-ray 
afterglow of GRB 050215b, although it is extremely weak in the first epoch 
(a few times 10^-13 ergs/cm**2/s at about 95 minutes post-burst).  However, 
we cannot rule out other possibilities.  We note that there is an optical 
source (R=17.3, B=18.5) in the USNO catalog at the edge of the XRT error 
circle of the detected X-ray source reported in GCN 3027.   If we assume 
that this object is the optical counterpart of our X-ray source, the 
optical-to-X-ray ratio is alpha_ox~1.35 during our first epoch, compatible 
with a radio-quiet AGN.  Optical spectroscopy of this USNO object would 
help determine its nature, and could eliminate it from consideration as a 
possible counterpart of SWIFT J113746.1+404754.

We do not detect any X-ray object in either epoch at the position of the 
UKIRT afterglow candidate (Tanvir et al. 2005, GCN 3031).  We place 95% 
upper limits on the XRT count rate from the UKIRT afterglow candidate of 
0.0006 cps in the first epoch and  0.0018 cps in the second epoch (0.2-10 
keV), within a 20 arcsecond radius circle of the UKIRT position.

Further Swift observations of this field are planned through the weekend.
