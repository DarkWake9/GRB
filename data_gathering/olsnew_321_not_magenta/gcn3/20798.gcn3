report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 1330 observations of galaxies (from the
2MPZ catalogue) within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G275697,
using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap,
galaxy distances were taken into account in selecting which ones to
observe. The observations currently span from 15 ks to 184 ks after the
LVC trigger, and cover 160 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for
overlaps). This covers 0.15 of the probability in the LVC skymap, and
0.29 of the probability in the LVC map after convolving with the 2MPZ
galaxy catalogue, as described by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,  462,
1591).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected 6 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 1 source of rank 3
  * 5 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7


RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.
  
  Source 8:
  =============
    RA: 	 17.4334 ( = 01h 09m 44.02s) J2000
    Dec:	 +73.1996 ( = +73d 11' 58.6") J2000
    Error:	 +5.6 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 0.0e+00 +/- 0.0e+00 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 0.0e+00 +/- 0.0e+00 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
    RASS UL:	 0.0e+00 ct/sec, 3-sigma, converted to XRT (0.3-10 keV)
       so the source is not above the RASS 3-sigma upper limit.
    There is no evidence for fading.
    NOTE: this source is NOT within 200 kpc of a GWGC or 2MPZ galaxy
      which is consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW
object.


RANK 4 sources
==============

These are catalogued X-ray sources, showing no signs of outburst
compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.
  
  Source 2:
  =============
    RA: 	 153.9839 ( = 10h 15m 56.14s) J2000
    Dec:	 -20.0412 ( = -20d 02' 28.3") J2000
    Error:	 +5.6 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 1.7e-01 +/- 6.0e-02 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 7.1e-12 +/- 2.6e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)

    Cat Flux:	 4.4e-12 +/- 6.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
       so the source  is 1.0-sigma above the catalogued flux.
    There is no evidence for fading.
    There are 2 GWGC or 2MPZ galaxies within 200 kpc of the source.
      and consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW
object.

  Source 3:
  =============

    Dec:	 -37.7381 ( = -37d 44' 17.2") J2000
    Error:	 +4.2 (arcsec, radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 9.8e-01 +/- 1.9e-01 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 4.2e-11 +/- 8.3e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)

    Cat Flux:	 8.3e-11 +/- 6.4e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
       so the source is not above the catalogued flux.
    The source may be fading, at the 1.1-sigma level.
    NOTE: this source is NOT within 200 kpc of a GWGC or 2MPZ galaxy
      which is consistent (within 3-sigma) with the distance to the GW
