report:



We re-imaged the location of the Swift detected GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al.,
GCN 16142) with the pODI instrument on the 3.5 m WIYN telescope at KPNO (
http://www.wiyn.org/ODI/About/wiynpODI.html).



Observations in the sdss r' band on 25 April 2014 consisted of one 300s
exposure, and one 600s exposures. The optical counterpart of the burst
(Elenin et al., GCN 16143; Kaur et al., GCN 16144; Ferrante et al., GCN
16145; Chester et al., GCN 16147) was detected under good conditions.

Calibration was the same as described in our previous report. Calibration
rms without color correction is < 0.1", consistency check with nearby SDSS
star shows calibration variations < 0.02 mag. No color / foreground
extinction correction was applied.
