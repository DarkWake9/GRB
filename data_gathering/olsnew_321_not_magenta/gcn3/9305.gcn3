J. Mao (YNAO & INAF-OAB), G. Cha and J. Bai (YNAO) report on behalf of the GMG group: 
 
We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 090424 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9223) using 
one 2.4-m telescope located at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) about 40 minutes after the trigger and
obtained the following magnitudes:

We continued our observations of GRB 090424 in R band started at 13:42:00 UT on April 
25, 2009. After 20 minutes of exposure time, we obtained the magnitude R=20.59 +/- 
0.07 mag.     
 
All the calibrations were processed by nearby SDSS stars. 
 
The telescope is charged by Yunnan Observatory (YNAO), Chinese Academy of Sciences.
