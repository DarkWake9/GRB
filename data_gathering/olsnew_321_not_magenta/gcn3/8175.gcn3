report:

We observed the field of GRB 080903 (Grupe et al. GCN 8169)  with Z-600 and
Celestron 11" telescopes of Mt. Terskol observatory.  A set of  60 s
exposures in R filter was taken with Z-600 starting 22 minutes after burst
onset. In a combined image we clearly detect afterglow candidate (Ugarte
Postigo et al. GCN 8172, Korotkiy et al. GCN 8173). Preliminary photometry
is based on USNO-A2.0 1350-06155883 star (05 47 16.36 +51 15 56.4) assuming
R=18.1:

T0+       Exp.        R_mag
(Mid)

1673 sec. 10x60 sec.  19.35 +/-0.2

The afterglow is also detected in unfiltered combined image (40x10s) taken
with Celestron 11" telescope at Tmid = 1280 s. The photometry is underway.
