The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:00:27 UT on 15 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220115A (trigger 663958832.581364 / 220115709).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 101.9, Dec = 11.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 47m, 11d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 29.0 degrees.
