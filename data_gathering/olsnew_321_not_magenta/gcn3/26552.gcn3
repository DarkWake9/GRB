report:

We observed the field of GRB191221B (Laha et al, GCN 26534) with the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the
Virgin Islands' Etelman Observatory on 12-22-2019 starting at 07:16:00
UT (T+10.6hrs). We performed a series of 50x10s exposures in R-band
filter. The weather conditions were clear during the hours of
observation and the
zenith angle at the start of observations was 60 degrees and rising.
We observed the enhanced Swift-XRT position with a 20'x20' field of
view.

We clearly detect the uncatalogued source within the enhanced
Swift-XRT error radius that was reported by Lipunov et al (GCN 26537).
We measure the source with a magnitude:

R = 16.7 + / - 0.1

The magnitude is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and
is not corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the
commissioning phase.

Observations and data analysis are ongoing.
