report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT has continued to monitor the light curve of GRB050713a with 
data taken as late as 10 days after the burst trigger.

We confirm the XMM observation of a decaying lightcurve with powerlaw slope 
consistent with alpha=1.45 during the epoch 20ks-50ks after the burst 
trigger (De Luca et al, GCN3695).  We note, however, that the entire XRT 
dataset, from 4ks to 1000ks after the burst trigger, shows a powerlaw shape 
very well fit by an alpha=1.15 decay index, with no evidence for a jet 
break.  We suggest that the steeper slope seen between 20ks-50ks may be due 
to flaring activity.

The XRT count rate during the last observation, on July 23rd, was 6e-4 
cts/s, equivalent to a flux of 4e-14 ergs/cm^2/s
