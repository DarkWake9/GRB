The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration report:

*** This is a test of the Early Warning alert system
resulting from archival O3 data. Times and sky
localizations are fictitious. ***

We identified the compact binary merger candidate
MS200618aq during real-time processing of data from LIGO
Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory
(L1) at 2020-06-18 05:47:57.119 UTC (GPS time:
1276494495.119). The candidate was found by the GstLAL
[1] analysis pipeline in the early warning configuration.
An Early Warning GCN Notice was issued 39 seconds before
the projected merger time. The GCN Notice included the
standard data products associated with CBC alerts, namely
localization [2] and source classification [3].

However, this Early Warning alert (MS200618aq) is no
longer of interest because it was not detected by the
regular, full-bandwidth search.
