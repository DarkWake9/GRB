We have analyzed the public INTEGRAL data of IBIS/PICsIT (200 - 2600 keV)
and SPI-ACS(>75 keV) in coincidence with the long, bright GRB 180914B,
which was initially reported by AGILE/MCAL (GCN 23226), AGILE/GRID (GCN
23231),
and Fermi/LAT(GCN 23232). The INTEGRAL orientation was 98.4 degrees from
the GRB location and implies a near optimal response for SPI-ACS and
a suppressed response for PICsIT (Savchenko et al. 2017, A&A 603, A46).

The GRB was clearly detected in SPI-ACS until about T0+250s
(T0=2018-09-14 18:23:02.22) and shows 8 flaring events, of which 7 show
large variability detected down to the 50 ms time-resolution of the
detector. 
It was also detected in PICsIT until approximately T0+130s, of which 5
flaring
events are clearly seen.  Because of the unfavorable viewing angle for
PICsIT,
the burst is predominately seen above 460 keV with significant
emission up to 1.2 MeV.
