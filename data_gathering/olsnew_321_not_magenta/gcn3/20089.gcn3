Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161022A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 718655) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 71s after the GRB trigger
(17s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased
from 56 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were excellents.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+71.2s to t0+131.2s : Rlim = 17.4

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+146.3s to t0+176.3s : Rlim = 18.5

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+146.3s to t0+442.9s : Rlim = 19.0

No more OT detection until t0+6800s at Rlim = 19.0.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
