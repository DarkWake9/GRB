A.K.H. Kong (NTHU, Taiwan) reports

We observed the field of GRB 191101A (D'Ai et al. GCN 26135) with the
T11 0.5m telescope of iTelescope.Net in New Mexico. The observation
was done with a luminance filter (400-700 nm) beginning at 2019-11-02
02:08:44 UT (5 hours after the trigger) for 300 sec. At the position
of the enhanced X-ray afterglow (Evans et al. GCN 26137), we do not
detect any optical emission with a detection limit of about 19.5 mag
by comparing with the Gaia DR2 catalogue.
