Further to our discovery of ATLAS17aeu (Tonry et al. GCN 20382), we 
took a spectrum with Gemini-North + GMOS (R400 grating, 
4491-8778 Angs) on MJD = 57761.595. We also took an r-band image 
on the same night. 

The spectrum has a blue featureless continuum, with a signal-to-noise
in the continuum S/N~10 at 7000Angs.  There are no clear emission or
absorption lines visible that can anchor a redshift estimate.

The spectrum is not unlike some GRB afterglows as shown in the compilation
of Fynbo et al. 2009, ApJS 185, 526 
e.g. GRB060512, at z~2.1, GRB061110A (z=0.7578), GRB070129 (no z
estimate, but below z<3.4)

We report three more photometric points, two from Pan-STARRS1 and 
the other from Gemini+GMOS. 

MJD           Mag           Telescope 
57758.38159   18.18 0.04 i  Pan-STARRS1
57759.46468   20.90 0.12 i  Pan-STARRS1
57761.51968   22.77 0.17 r  Gemini+GMOS 

These data further support the hypothesis of Kasliwal et al. GCN 20393
that this is most likely the afterglow of GRB170105A, supported by the
x-ray and radio detections of Evans et al. GCN 20390 and Corsi et al.
GCN 20396.

Using the POLAR detection time, a temporal index of F_nu \propto
t**(-1.4) would be consistent with the photometry reported to date,
typical of GRB afterglows.

We note there are several other faint galaxies closer to ATLAS17aeu
than the brighter galaxy at z = 0.199 highlighted in Tonry et al. (GCN
20382). They have SDSS photometric redshifts of z ~ 0.35 - 0.38, but
are marginal detections in more than one band and therefore the 
photometric redshifts are uncertain.
