B. E. Cobb, S. B. Cenko, J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report on  behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 100205A (Racusin et al., GCN 10361) with
the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the 8 m Gemini South
telescope beginning at 05:48 UT on 05 February 2010 (~ 40 minutes after
the burst trigger time).  Observations were conducted in the r' filter for
a total of 600 seconds.

We find no new point sources at the location of the X-ray afterglow 
(Racusin et al., GCN 10361).  The preliminary limiting magnitude of our
image is r' >~ 23.4 mag for isolated point sources (assuming the SDSS
value of r = 17.76 for the object at RA: 09:25:28.956, Dec: +31:44:20.61).
