The short GRB 130628A (Byrne et al. GCN 14969) was detected by the the
Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy range of
50 keV - 5 MeV at 12:44:04.634 UT (=T0). The observed light curve shows
a single peak with a duration (T90) of about 2.4 seconds. The fluence in
100 - 1000 keV was 3.70 (+0.65/-0.71) x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-s peak flux
measured from T0+2 s was 2.93 (+0.54/-0.71) photons/cm2/s in the same
energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-5 s to
T0+5 s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of 2.11
(+0.41/-0.31) (chi2/d.o.f = 20.3/15).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level, in which
the systematic uncertainties are not included.
