SUBJECT: GRB050607: KAIT optical limits
DATE:    05/06/07 23:16:04 GMT
FROM:    Weidong Li at UC Berkeley KAIT/LOSS  <weidong@astron.berkeley.edu>

W. Li, R. Chornock, S. Jha, and A. V. Filippenko, University of
California, Berkeley, report: 

"The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB050607 detected with Swift
(Retter et al., GCN 3525).  A series of images was automatically
obtained from 09:12:12 UT (49s after the burst) to 10:10:19 UT
(3536s after the burst) The sequence includes a combination of
images taken with the V and I filters, as well as some that are
unfiltered.  We did not detect the optical afterglow as reported
by Rhoads (GCN 3527, 3531) and Halpern et al. (GCN 3530). Our
first 15s unfiltered image started at 49s after the burst has a
limiting magnitude of about 18.4 when compared to the USNO-B1.0
catalog, while a combined unfiltered image centered at 09:16:13 UT
(290s after the burst) has a limiting mag of about 19.6. "
