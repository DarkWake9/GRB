D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), M. Beck (ISDC) on behalf of the
IBAS Localization Team, N. Mowlavi and S. Shaw on behalf of the INTEGRAL
Science Data Centre and the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

SGR 1806-20 has been moderately active after the burst of March 9 (Gotz et

The burst of March 30 was among the brightest detected by INTEGRAL from
this Soft Gamma-Ray Repeater. It consisted of a main peak lasting about
0.11 s, followed by a smaller peak 0.1 s later. The fluence of the main
peak was about 3 x 10-7 erg cm-2 (15-100 keV).
