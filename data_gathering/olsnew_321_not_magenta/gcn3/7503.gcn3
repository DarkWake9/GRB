C. Clemens, S. Klose (Tautenburg Obs.), J. Greiner, A. Kupcu Yoldas, A. 
Yoldas, T. Kruehler and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest and MPE 
Garching) (all others MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080319D (SWIFT trigger 306793; P. J. Brown et 
al., GCN 7453) simultaneously in g', r', i', z', J, H and K with GROND 
(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP) mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla 
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 00:15 UT on March 20th, 2008, about 7.2 hrs after the 
GRB trigger at an airmass of 1.7 to 2.5. We obtained 0.5 hrs of total 
integration time in g', r', i' and z' and found a source, which might be the 
host galaxy, also present in the DSS2 red images at

RA (J2000.0) = 06h 37m 53.56s
DEC (J2000.0) = 23d 56' 34.2''

within the 0.5'' Swift UVOT error circle reported by S. Immler et al. in GCN 
7458. The object is seen in all bands except K, implying a redshift smaller 
than 3.5.

Our co-added images reveal roughly estimated magnitudes of g' = 21.3, r' = 
20.7, i' = 19.9 and z' = 19.7, calibrated against USNO-B catalogue stars.

No statement about variability, i.e. an additional contribution from afterglow 
light, can be made at this point. Further observations are planned.
