At 12:40:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050219.  The spacecraft autonomously slewed
to the burst location (started at T+12 sec and was on target at T+78 sec).
The XRT and UVOT instruments then began their standard set
of pre-programmed observing sequences.

Using the time interval of the burst before the slew, the ground-calculated
location is RA,Dec 166.409,-40.677 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 43 degrees off the BAT boresight (30% encoding).  It is
within 25 arcsec of the XRT position (Romano et al., GCN Circ 3036).

The burst lightcurve has two overlapping peaks, with a T90 duration
of ~23 sec.  The peak flux is 5.5 ph/cm2/sec for a 1-sec interval (15-350 keV).
The fluence is ~9.4e-6 erg/cm^2 (15-350 keV).
