S. B. Pandey and W. Zheng (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:

Further analysis of GRB 100805A data taken from ROTSE-IIIb clearly detects
the
optical afterglow candidate (Hoversten E. A. et al., GCN 11047) in the
images
taken ~50.9 s after the burst (Pandey S. B. & Zheng W., GCN 11048).

In the consecutive images taken by ROTSE, the optical afterglow show a
temporal
decay nature very similar to those reported by Cenko S. B. (GCN 11051) and
Holland S. T. et al (GCN 11062). The optical afterglow detection by ROTSE
was
not reported in the previous circular (GCN 11048) due to a problem in the
online data processing.
