T. Cline, on behalf of the HETE and Ulysses GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and HETE-FREGATE observed this burst at 72969 s.  As 
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~400 s, a 25-100
keV fluence of ~2.7E-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.25
s of 7.8E-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000) = 175.554, 36.863 degrees,
whose radius is 69.679 +/- 0.266 degrees (3 sigma).

Earth-blocking and field-of-view considerations will make
it possible to constrain the localization further.  At this
point, it is not clear whether this event was observed by
Mars Odyssey, and thus whether an error box can ultimately
be derived for it.
