"A preliminary quick inspection of one single R image of the field of 
GRB 000301C (RXTE/ASM and IPN localization, Smith, Hurley and Cline, GCN 568) 
taken on March 3, starting at 04:27 UT (EEV-CCD,1000 sec exposure) with the 
152 cm telescope of Loiano shows an object located at RA=16h 20m 18.5s, 
D=29`26'35" (Eq. 2000), which is not present on the Digital Sky Survey. 
It is roughly 1 mag brighter than the POSS limit and it is coincident with 
the object detected by Fynbo et al., GCN 570.
Only new observation can decide if this object is the OT connected with 
GRB 000301C.
