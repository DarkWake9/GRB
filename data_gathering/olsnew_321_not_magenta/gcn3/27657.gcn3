T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 18:26:20 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a burst from the Soft Gamma Repeater SGR 1935+2154 (Trigger #968211). 
Because this is a known source Swift did not automatically slew.  
The on-board location is
RA, Dec 293.735, +21.895 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 34m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 53' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single
64 ms bin with a peak count rate of 25k counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at the time of the trigger. 

A second BAT trigger from this source was seen at 18:32:59 
(trigger #968212) with comparable intensity. 

Follow-up observations with Swift are planned.
