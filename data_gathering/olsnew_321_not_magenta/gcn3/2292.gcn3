K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 00135
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.0E-07 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  7.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 154.708,  28.663 degrees, whose radius is 27.903 +/-  0.045
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
