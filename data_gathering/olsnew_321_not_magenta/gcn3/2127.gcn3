I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,  report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and Konus-Wind  observed
this GRB at 81727 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately 65 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
1.3E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.0E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it a  preliminary, 3 sigma error box  
with approximate area  77 square arcminutes whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
19 h  1 m 43.00 s    -68 o  4 '  39.37 "  (CENTER)
19 h  1 m 20.54 s    -68 o  5 '  15.94 "  (CORNER)
19 h  3 m  6.15 s    -68 o 20 '  11.99 "  (CORNER)
19 h  0 m 22.64 s    -67 o 48 '  59.85 "  (CORNER)
19 h  2 m  5.44 s    -68 o  4 '   2.57 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
