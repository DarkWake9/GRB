The Swift GRB 071003 (Schady et al. GCN 6837) was observed using 1.04 m
Sampurnanand Telescope. The optical afterglow candidate reported by Li
(GCN 6838), Cenko & Fox (GCN 6839) is clearly seen in U and B band 
frames in 300 sec exposure each. The fading nature of the source is seen
and U ~ 17 mag was measured around 7.5 hours after the burst. The 
contamination due
to the nearby bright stars makes the photometry complicated. Multiband
observations and detailed observations are underway.
