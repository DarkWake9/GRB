We observed GRB 220408A with the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m
Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). Observations began on April 9, 2022
at 06:25:23 UT in r-band (~1.03 d after the GRB). At the location of the
optical counterpart (Caputo et al., GCN 31848), we marginally detect a
source with magnitude r~24.5 +/- 0.3 AB mag. This is likely dominated by
the contribution from the host galaxy (Zhu et al., GCN 31864), and is
consistent with fading of the earlier detection by Zhu et al. (GCN 31864).

Magnitudes are calibrated against the PS1 catalog and are not corrected
for Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance
with these observations.
