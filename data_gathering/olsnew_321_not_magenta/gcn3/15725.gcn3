V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, V. Pelassa, and A. Goldstein,
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140110A (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 15714; von 
Kienlin & Connaughton, GCN Circ. 15716) has been also observed by Swift 
(BAT), and MESSENGER (GRNS), so far, at about 22718 s UT (06:18:38). The 
burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a GBM-MESSENGER annulus centered at
RA(2000)=299.570 deg (19h 58m 17s)  Dec(2000)=-22.828 deg (-22d 49' 
41"), whose radius is  76.183 Â± 0.140 deg (3 sigma).

This annulus intersects the Fermi-LAT 90% CL error circle (Bissaldi et 
al., GCN Circ. 15714) to form an error box whose area is about 3 times
smaller than that of the LAT error circle, and whose
corners are:
-----------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
-----------------------------------------------
    Corners:
    29.211 (01h 56m 51s) -36.693 (-36d 41' 35")
    28.826 (01h 55m 18s) -35.764 (-35d 45' 49")
    28.614 (01h 54m 27s) -35.817 (-35d 49' 00")
    28.999 (01h 56m 00s) -36.754 (-36d 45' 13")
-----------------------------------------------
This box may be improved.

Only one of the reported XRT sources (Maselli et al., GCN Circ. 15721), 
the source 7, is consistent with the IPN annulus and, hence, can be the 
afterglow.
