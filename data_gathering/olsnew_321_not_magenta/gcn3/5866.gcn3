D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) and D. Malesani (NBI/Dark) report:

We are observing the afterglow of GRB 061126 (Sbarufatti et 
al., GCN 5854, Vanden Berk et al., GCN 5856) with the 1.34m 
Schmidt telescope of the Thueringer Landessternwarte 
Tautenburg in Germany. Sky conditions are variable, with 
passing clouds.

Observations started at 18:20:41 UT and consist of 600 s R 
band exposures. The initial airmass was 1.47, it is decreasing.  
The afterglow is detected on most single frames.

From a raw image, we measure the following magnitude in 
comparison to the USNO-B1 catalog (R1 magnitudes):

R = 21.5 +/- 0.25 at 0.49907 days after the burst.

(Errors are 0.2 mag statistical and 0.1 mag systematic.)

We find this agrees very well with an alpha = 1 extrapolation of 
the data of Smith et al. (GCN 5857) and Updike et al. (GCN 
5959).

Observations are continuing as weather permits.

Spectroscopy is encouraged.
