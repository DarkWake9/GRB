TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3995
SUBJECT: GRB 050916: XRT position

FROM:    David Morris at PSU/Swift-XRT  <morris@astro.psu.edu>

D. Morris (PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing the long weak burst GRB 050916 (trigger 
#155408, Morris et al., GCN 3991) at 16:35:52 UT, but was unable to 
obtain an on-board centroid. Analysis of the initial ground-processed 
data finds a faint, fading, and uncataloged source at coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 09 03 56.8
Dec(J2000) = -51 25 46.8

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds (90% containment). This 
position lies 20 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3991.
