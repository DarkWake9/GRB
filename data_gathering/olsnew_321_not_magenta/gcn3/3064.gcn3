Optical and near-infrared monitoring of the field of GRB050219b 
(Cummings et al., GCN 3044) was performed at the ESO-VLT, with the FORS2 
and ISAAC instruments respectively. Observations were carried out under 
a clear sky, starting 0.18 days after the GRB. The log is reported below.

Mean date (UT) t-t0 (days)  filter  seeing (")
----------------------------------------------
Feb 20.062     0.18         R       1.0
Feb 21.062     1.18         R       1.0
Feb 21.088     1.21         Ks      0.5
Feb 24.024     4.14         Ks      0.5
----------------------------------------------
t0 = Feb 19.879 UT (GRB trigger).

In the refined XRT position and error circle (Burrows et al., GCNs 3043; 
Racusin et al., GCN 3049) we detect three sources in the Ks images:


1. RA: 05:25:15.99  Dec: -57:45:28.7
2. RA: 05:25:16.13  Dec: -57:45:30.5
3. RA: 05:25:15.59  Dec: -57:45:25.4

Source #2 and #3 do not exhibit significant variations (the latter being 
also present in the 2MASS catalogue).
Source #1 is pointlike and is fading by 1.09 +- 0.19 mag in the Ks band 
between 1.21 and 4.15 days after the burst. We therefore identify this 
is the NIR afterglow of GRB050219b. The flux decay index (F = 
K*t^-delta) is delta = 0.81 +- 0.14.

The candidate afterglow has a magnitude Ks = 21.47 +- 0.18 on Feb 24.02, 
based upon field calibration with standard stars. We caution that we get 
Ks = 16.45 +- 0.04 for the 2MASS star quoted above (source #3), which 
has a tabulated magnitude K=15.345 in the 2MASS catalog.

In the R band, no source is detected at the position of the candidate 
afterglow, down to a limiting magnitude R~23, based on calibration 
against the USNO catalog.

Further observations are planned at the VLT.
