We report the search results of AT2018cow in the Swift/BAT data.
Using the source location of (RA, Dec) = (244.00090, 22.26800) deg
from Smartt et al. ATel #11727, the BAT mask-weighted light curve
from the BAT survey data (14-195 keV) shows marginal detections
of AT2018cow at ~ 3 sigma at ~T0, ~T0+1, and ~T0+6 days.
T0 = 2018-06-16 at 10:35:02 UTC, which is the time of discovery
reported in Smartt et al. ATel #11727.

The 3 sigma detections are roughly consistent with NuSTAR flux
measurements (Margutti et al., ATel #11775). However, we note that
due to the low significance of these detections, we cannot rule out that
these are due to noise fluctuation.

A search with the BAT onboard sub-threshold triggers found no events
with localizations that are consistent with AT2018cow.

The results of the BAT data analysis are at
https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/BATbursts/AT2018cow/top.html

The light curves and data will continue to be updated on a daily
basis in the near future.
