B. E. Cobb (GWU), reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we obtained
optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 130418A (GCN 14377,
De Pasquale et al.) at two epochs (with mid-exposure times of
2013-04-19 00:03 UT & 01:24 UT). For each epoch, several dithered
images were obtained with total summed exposure times of
15 min in V and I and 12 min in J and K.

The fading afterglow of GRB 130418A (e.g. GCN 14377, De Pasquale
et al.; GCN 14378, Gorosabel et al.; GCN 14379, Quadri et al.)
was detected with the following magnitudes:

(hours)               V mag              I mag               J
mag              K mag
5.03944 hours   18.41 +/- 0.03  17.57 +/- 0.03  16.46 +/- 0.10  14.82 +/-
0.10
6.38972 hours   18.59 +/- 0.03  17.69 +/- 0.03  16.70 +/- 0.10  15.05 +/-
0.10

(Optical photometry is calibrated against Landolt standard stars
and IR photometry is calibrated against a 2MASS star in the field.)

Between about 5 hrs and 6.4 hrs post-burst, the GRB afterglow fades with
a decay rate of approximately alpha = 0.6 +/- 0.2 in the optical
(where afterglow flux is proportional to t^-alpha).
