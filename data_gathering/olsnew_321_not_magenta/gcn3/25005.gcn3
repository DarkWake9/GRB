The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:50:05 UT on 7 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190707A (trigger 584175010.12659 / 190707285).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 152.9, Dec = -31.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 11m, -31d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
