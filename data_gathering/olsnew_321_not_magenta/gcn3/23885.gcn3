MASTER-Amur robotic telescope (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, v.2010, 30L)
  located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State Pedagogical University)
was pointed to the  GRB190211A (Marshall et al. GCN 23883)
8 sec after notice time (46 sec after trigger time) at 2019-02-11 16:55:30 UT.

On our first (10s exposure)  set there is no  optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box (ra=196.675 dec=41.9658 r=0.05) with 16.4m (5-sigma) upper limit 
(NEXT-0.6,  Xu et al. GCN 23884 with RA,Dec=13:06:38.47 +41:58:04.93).

The galactic latitude b = 75 deg., longitude l = 110 deg.
The observations started when error box altitude was 65 deg.
The moon (38 % bright part) altitude was -14 deg.
The sun  altitude was -50.9 deg.


MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope located in Russia (Applied Physics Institute, Irkutsk State University)
was pointed to the  GRB190211A 38 sec after notice time (76 sec after triggertime)
at 2019-02-11 16:56:00 UT.

On our first (10s exposure)  set we didn't find optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box with  5-sigma upper limit 16.4m

The observations started when error-box altitde was  50 deg.
The sun  altitude  was -51.9 deg.
