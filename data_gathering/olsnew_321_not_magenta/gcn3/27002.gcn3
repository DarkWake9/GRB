The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:56:21 UT on 6 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200206A (trigger 602700986.456684 / 200206706).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 298.2, Dec = -49.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 52m, -49d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 18.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44.0 degrees.
