TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2928
SUBJECT: VLA observations of SGR 1806-20
DATE:    05/01/03 20:27:48 GMT
FROM:    Patrick B. Cameron at Caltech  <pbc@astro.caltech.edu>

P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

"We observed the position of SGR 1806-20 with the Very Large Array (VLA)
in
A-configuration on 2005
Jan 3.81 UT (t ~ 6.9 days after the giant flare, GCN #2920).  We detect a
radio source coincident with the X-ray position reported by
Kaplan et al. (2002, ApJ, 564, 935) at the approximate freqeucnies
and flux densities
listed below.

Freq (GHz)    Flux density (mJy)
--------------------------------
4.86           73
8.46           41

This is a factor of brighter of 100 times brighter at 8.46 GHz than SGR
1900+14 at peak. Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation."
