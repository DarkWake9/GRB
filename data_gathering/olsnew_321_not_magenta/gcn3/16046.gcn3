A long-duration, very intense GRB 140329A
(Fermi-GBM detection: von Kienlin & Younes, GCN 16042;
IPN triangulation: Hurley at al., GCN 16045)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=25481.877 s UT (07:04:41.877).

The burst light curve starts with a short pulse at ~T0 followed
by a bright multi-peaked complex from ~T0+19 s to ~T0+30 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of 8.5(-0.7,+0.7)x10^-5 erg/cm2, and a 64-ms peak flux,
measured from T0+23.744 s, of 2.7(-0.3,+0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+33.024 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.04 (-0.09,+0.11),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.30 (-0.17,+0.11),
the peak energy Ep = 238 (-28,+32) keV,
chi2 = 132/95 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+23.296 to T0+23.808 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.90 (-0.11,+0.13),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.7 (-1.1,+0.3),
the peak energy Ep = 388 (-66,+75) keV,
chi2 = 68.0/80 dof.
