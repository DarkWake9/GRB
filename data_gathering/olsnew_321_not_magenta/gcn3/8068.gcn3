Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080805 (trigger #319036)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 8059).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 314.231, -62.433 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 56m 55.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -62d 25' 58.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like peak starting at ~T-5sec,
peaking at ~T+3 sec, and ending at ~T+140 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
78 +- 7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.1 to T+93.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.53 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.62 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
