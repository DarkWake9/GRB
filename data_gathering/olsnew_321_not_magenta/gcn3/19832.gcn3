Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.), Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. 
(CNRS-OMP-IRAP), Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160821A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 709351) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 29.31min after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from
10 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were fair.

We detect a new fading source in the error box given by SWIFT (Siegel et 
al., GCNC 19830) at the following position (+/- 3 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 11h 25m 01.6s
DEC(J2000.0) +42d 20' 05"

OT was R~15.4 at 29.31min after GRB. Due to the brightness of the event, 
we encourage any follow-up.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=166.5065 lat=+66.7370
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.1 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
