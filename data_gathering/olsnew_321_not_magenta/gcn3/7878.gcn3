Christina C. Thoene, Daniele Malesani, Johan P. U. Fynbo (DARK), Lison Malo
(Universite de Montreal), Richardo J. Cardenes and Anlaug Amanda
Djupvik (NOT) report:

We observed the field of GRB 080613B (Markwardt et al., GCN 7873) on
June 13 with the NOT on La Palma using StanCam
and NOTCAM. Observations of 4x300s in R band were obtained with
StanCam starting at UT 21:57 and 5x270s with NOTCAM in the Ks band
starting UT 23:17.
In the stacked images of both filters we do not detect any optical
counterpart within the XRT error circle (Mao et al. GCN 7875). The
limiting magnitudes are about R=22 mag and Ks=17.6 based on USNO and
2MASS stars in the field respectively.
