Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the MAXI-detected
burst GRB 161123A (Hanyu et al. GCN Circ. 20203) in a series of
observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 2.6 ks,
distributed over 7 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location
was 825 s. The data were collected between T0+21.8 ks and T0+28.0 ks,
and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

No X-ray sources have been detected. The 3-sigma upper limit in the
field (not including the regions where the tiles overlap) ranges from
~0.02 to ~0.05 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
8.2e-13 to 1.9e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the tiled XRT
observations, including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are
available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00061.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
