Speckhard, A.Trotter, and J. A. Crain report:

Skynet began observing the field of GRB130215A (Swift trigger 548760, GCN 
14204) in BVRI beginning ~12 minutes after the burst using four of the 
PROMPT telescopes located at CTIO in Chile, and the DSO-14 telescope and 
Morehead telescope in North Carolina, USA.  A bright, fading source is 
detected at the position reported by the ROTSE group (GCN 14205.)

Calibrating to several nearby USNO B1.0/NOMAD stars, we find the following 
initial magnitudes:

Filt    Time    Mag
B       15.4m	15.4 
V	15.4m	14.5
R       13.0m	13.8
I       15.5	13.3


The object has set in Chile, but further observations from the Northern 
hemisphere telescopes are ongoing.
