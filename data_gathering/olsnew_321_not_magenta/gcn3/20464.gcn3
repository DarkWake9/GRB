report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 17:49:14.03 on January 15, 2017 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy
emission from GRB 170115B, which was also detected by
Fermi-GBM (GCNC 20463).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 189.12, -46.85 (J2000)
with an error radius of 0.26 deg (90 % containment, statistical error 
only).

This was ~40 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger and 
triggered
an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
that is spatially and temporally correlated with the trigger with high 
significance.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elisabetta Bissaldi (elisabetta.bissaldi@ba.infn.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed
to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and
DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy,
Japan and Sweden.
