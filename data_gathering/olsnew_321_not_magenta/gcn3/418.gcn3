K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

We have obtained a preliminary IPN annulus for GRB991014 (GCN 417).  This
annulus is centered at RA=162.2315 deg., Decl.=-19.0726 deg. (J2000),
and has a radius of 66.1316 +/-  0.0275 deg. (3 sigma).  It intersects the
BeppoSAX NFI error circle (GCN 373) to form an ~36 arcmin.^2 error
box whose corners are:

RA(2000)	Decl.(2000)
6 h 50 m 47 s  +11 o  31' 53"
6 h 51 m 08 s  +11 o  41' 38"
6 h 50 m 59 s  +11 o  29' 58"
6 h 51 m 21 s  +11 o  40' 32"

A map may be found at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/991014/.  Some
refinements to this annulus are expected.
