"On 2004 Sept. 23.22 UT we carried out follow-up observations with the
VLA at 8.46 GHz centered on the optical afterglow candidate (GCN 2726)
of XRF 040916 (GCN 2712). Within a circle of 1-arcsec radius there are
no radio sources to a 3-sigma limit of 99 microJy.

No further observations are planned."
