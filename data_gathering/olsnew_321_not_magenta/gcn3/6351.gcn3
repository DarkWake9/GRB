The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) imaged the position of the GRB 070411
afterglow (Moretti et al, GCN 6267; Kann et al. GCN 6268) with the
LBC-blue CCD camera (http//lbc.mporzio.astro.it) and 8.4-m SX mirror on
2007 April 22.14 (UT). Ten dithered, 200 second exposures were obtained
with the Sloan-r filter in poor seeing and a bright sky background. No
afterglow is detected and we estimate a 3-sigma upper-limit of r>25.3 mag.

Extrapolating the power-law decay found by Prieto et al. (GCN 6346) to
10.3 days after the burst, we expected an afterglow brightness of
r=25.1+/-0.2 mag. Our non-detection is therefore marginal confirmation
of a break in the light curve as reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 6343).
The Keck observation (Perley et al GCN 6350) on day 4.4 also supports an
increase in the decay rate.
