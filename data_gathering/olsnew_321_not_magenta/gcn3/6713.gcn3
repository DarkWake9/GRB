D. Malesani (DARK) reports:

I have looked again at the NOT and VLT images of GRB 070721B (Ziaeepour 
et al., GCN 6640), and realized there has been some confusion in what 
reported in our GCNs 6651 and 6655.

The correct afterglow position is (J2000):

RA = 02:12:32.97
Dec = -02:11:40.4

with an estimated error of 0.5". This position is within 0.4" of and 
consistent with the UVOT afterglow position as reported by Schady (GCN 
6641). In the finding chart (Malesani et al., GCN 6651) posted at

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~malesani/GRB/070721B/

the afterglow corresponds to object #1, and not #2 as written in GCN 
6655 (Fynbo et al.). Object #2 (RA = 02:12:33.03, Dec = -02:11:40.6) is 
a closeby, real object, likely unrelated to the GRB. The redshift 
z=3.626 reported in GCN 6651 correctly refers to the afterglow.

I apologize for any confusion this may have created.
