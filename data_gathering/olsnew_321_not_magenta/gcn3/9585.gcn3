the Swift Team:

At 21:20:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090628 (trigger=355942).  Swift could not immediately 
slew to the burst.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 237.050, -15.977 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 48m 12s
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 58' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an Earth limb constraint, a prompt slew was not possible.  
Swift will execute a delayed slew after 2656 s.  No XRT or UVOT 
data will be available until the slew occurs. 

The series GCN Notices for this burst are corrupted 
with many (but not all) bogus values.  For the moment,
please disregard the original series of notices.  We may
issue Updated position notices when the information becomes available. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vanessa AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
