Swift-BAT detected GRB 200409A at 03:19:59 UT (GCN 27509). There was no
Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event.

An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard
triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM identified GRB 200904A with high
reliability [1], with a localization consistent with the Swift-BAT
location, and a discovery timescale of 0.703 s.

The GBM targeted search [2], the most sensitive, coherent search for
GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around BAT trigger time. A transient
source was identified whose most significant timescale according to the
search is 1.024 s, with a log likelihood ratio of 62, with a consistent
location, and is consistent with a soft spectrum for a GRB.

Preliminary spectral analysis statistically prefers a power-law fit over
models that constrain Epeak. Using T0-0.320 to T0+0.320 as the source
interval gives an alpha of -1.84 +/- 0.06, a photon flux of 3.3 +/- 0.4
ph/s/cm^2, and a fluence of (2.0+/-0.2)E-7 erg/s/cm^2.
