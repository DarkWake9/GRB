(INAF-IASFPA), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), B. Sbarufatti (PSU), D.N.
Burrows (PSU), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester)
and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 211024A (Aaron Tohuvavohu et al. GCN Circ.
31006), collecting 5.1 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+221.8 ks and T0+234.5 ks. 

Four uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. Details of these sources are given below:

Source 3:
  RA (J2000.0):  27.9803  =  01:51:55.28
  Dec (J2000.0): -6.9611  =  -06:57:39.9
  Error: 9.0 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (1.24 [+0.76, -0.56])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 261 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (4.0 [+2.4, -1.8])e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 4:
  RA (J2000.0):  28.1958  =  01:52:47.00
  Dec (J2000.0): -7.0082  =  -07:00:29.4
  Error: 3.3 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: 0.0146 [+0.0032, -0.0029] ct s^-1   
  Distance: 527 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.
  Flux: (3.49 [+0.76, -0.70])e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 5:
  RA (J2000.0):  27.8881  =  01:51:33.14
  Dec (J2000.0): -6.9512  =  -06:57:04.2
  Error: 6.8 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (1.21 [+0.83, -0.59])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 592 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.

Source 6:
  RA (J2000.0):  28.0277  =  01:52:6.65
  Dec (J2000.0): -7.0969  =  -07:05:48.8
  Error: 7.5 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (1.60 [+0.87, -0.66])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 454 arcsec from Swift/BAT position.

A catalogued source was also detected.
