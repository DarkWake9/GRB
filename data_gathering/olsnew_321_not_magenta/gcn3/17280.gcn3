Swift Team:

At 15:39:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located 4U 1700+24 (= V934 Her) (trigger=623434).  Swift slewed 
immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 256.627, +23.962 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 06m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 57' 45"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 15:45:46.6 UT, 399.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright X-ray source located at RA, Dec
256.6423, 23.9712 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +17h 06m 34.15s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 58' 16.3"
with an uncertainty of 5.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 60 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position is 5.5 arcseconds from a known X-ray
source: 1SXPS J170634.5+235816, which is coincident with V* V934 Her. 
This source is in the Swift XRT 1SXPS catalogue 
with a mean 0.3-10 keV count-rate of 0.3810 +/- 0.0067 ct/sec; 
see http://www.swift.ac.uk/1SXPS/1SXPSJ170634.5%2B235816 for
details of these previous observations. No event data are yet available
to determine the column density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.90e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 411 seconds after the BAT trigger. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image only
shows the bright (V=7.6) known source V* V934 Her. 

This symbiotic star has been seen by Swift multiple times in the past 
few months (e.g. Kennea et al., GCN 17173; Krimm et al. ATel 6482) in
an escalating series of peaks.  The BAT lightcurve can be seen at
