TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7971
SUBJECT: GRB 080702B: Swift XRT confirmation of the afterglow
DATE:    08/07/11 09:18:26 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and M. de Pasquale (MSSL/UCL) report on behalf
of the Swift team.

Swift has reobserved the field of GRB 080702B (Cummings et al. GCN Circ.
7924) in two pointings on 2008 July 8 and 2008 July 10 (six and eight
days after the burst respectively), obtaining 7 ks of data in total.

The second X-ray source reported in our previous circular (Evans et al.
(GCN Circ 7931) is not detected in these data, with a 3-sigma
upper limit of 1.3e-3 counts per second. The count-rate in the initial
observation was (5.4 +/- 1.8)e-3 counts per second, thus the source has
faded.

We therefore conclude that this was the afterglow of GRB 080702B.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
