The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 070612B detected with Swift
(Trigger 282073; Grupe et al. GCN 6511). The automatic sequence
started at 06:22:01, 44 s after the burst. The BAT location 
and the XRT position (Grupe & Evans GCN 6514) have been monitored
in V, I, and clear filters, with varying exposure times. The observations
are still on-going.  Our image processing pipeline did not find any
new objects within the XRT error circle, with the following photometry
limits (calibrated with USNO B1.0). These magnitudes have not been
corrected for Galactic extinction, which as estimated by the NED
extinction calculator is approximately E(B-V) = 0.838 mag in this
direction.

========================================================================

More images, mostly 60 s exposures in the I and clear filters,
have been obtained. No obvious OA was found in the XRT error
circle to a limiting magnitude of 19.0 - 19.9 mag, at 
t= 304s to 6642s after the burst. 

More analyses are in progress.
