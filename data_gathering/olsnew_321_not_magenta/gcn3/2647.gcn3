TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2647
SUBJECT: Bursting activity from SGR 1806-20 detected with IBAS

FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

S. Mereghetti, D.Gotz (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw (ISDC),
and K.Hurley (UCB/SSL) report:

Two weak bursts from SGR 1806-20 have been detected with the IBIS/ISGRI
instrument at UT 04:56:19.3 and 05:59:51.3 of 2004 Aug 17.

Both bursts lasted 0.1 s and had a fluence of about 1.5x10-8 erg cm-2
(15-100 keV).

They had significance below the threshold for automatic delivery of IBAS
Alert Packets.
INTEGRAL will continue to observe SGR 1806-20 until 03:10 UT of Aug 19.
If stronger bursts from this source are detected, automatic Alert Packets
will be distributed in real time (expected delay of 10-20 s)
