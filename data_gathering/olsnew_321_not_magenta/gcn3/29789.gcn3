The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:30:56 UT on 11 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210411A (trigger 639804661.435174 / 210411146).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 259.4, Dec = -27.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 17m, -27d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.
