D. Xu, Z.P. Zhu, X. Liu, B.Y. Yu, Y. Ma (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 
Senior High School) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200215A (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) 
using the NEXT 0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. Observations automatically started at 14:40:59 UT on 2002-02-15, 
i.e., 88 s after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s,  4x60 s, and 5x90 
s frames in the Sloan r-filter. Observations then ended due to 
follow-ups of LIGO/Virgo S200213t.

No optical afterglow is detected in our images at the XRT position 
(Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) down to a limiting magnitude of r~18.0, 
calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
