on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 08:50:21.82 UT, the Swift-BAT instrument triggered (trigger=145729).
After careful analysis of the full Malindi data set, this trigger
has been determined to not be due to a real GRB.  It is most likely
due to a particle shower event.

And to review the recent activity of BAT triggers and bursts:
