Daniele B. Malesani (DAWN/NBI and DARK/NBI) and Nicolas Crouzet (IAC) 
report:

We observed the field of the short GRB 180805B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 
23076; Sakamoto et al., GCN 23082) using one of the 40-cm telescopes 
located in the Teide observatory (Canary Islands), part of the Las 
Cumbres Observatory network.

Observations consisted of 9x300 s exposures in the SDSS r filter, 
centered around the mean epoch Aug 6.19 UT (15.49 hr after the GRB). The 
PSF delivered to the image is around 3".

No object is detected within or close to the X-ray afterglow error 
circle (Evans et al., GCN 23077), down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude 
of r = 20 AB, calibrated using nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.
