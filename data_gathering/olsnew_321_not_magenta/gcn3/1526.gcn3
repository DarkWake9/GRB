write:

Analysis of the full data set derived from the HETE Soft X-ray Camera 
(SXC) has resulted in a revised location for GRB020819(=H2275; 
Vanderspek et al, GCN Circular #1508). The revised SXC location can 
be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 64" in radius and is 
centered at:

RA = 23h 27m 25.1s, Dec = +6o 16' 46" (J2000)

This revised SXC localization lies fully within the original 130" 
radius SXC error circle reported by Vanderspek et al in GCN1508, as 
well as fully within the annulus for the IPN location reported by 
Hurley et al in GCN1507.
