K. Hurley, on behalf of the INTEGRAL AO-4 SGR ToO team, reports:

In view of the recent activity of SGR1806-20 observed by Konus (GCN 6228),
as well as a lower level of activity observed by Swift, we have called
an INTEGRAL target of opportunity observation of this source.  The start
times and durations of the observations are:

Start time, UT          Duration (s)  
2007-04-06 11:33:21.0   109728   
2007-04-07 19:31:06.0   44577     
2007-04-08 08:40:42.0   24003     
2007-04-08 16:06:00.0   30861  

We encourage supporting observations at all wavelengths.
