K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The fit results to the Swift-XRT light curve provided in GCN 22685 were
incomplete. The correct fit is as follows:

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha= 1.47 (+0.16, -0.17). At T+222 s the decay
steepens to an alpha of 2.81 (+0.20, -0.14) before breaking again at
T+1078 s to a final decay with index alpha=0.83 (+/- 0.13).

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of 0.83
, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 2.7 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.0 x 10^-13
(1.3 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
