The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 09:17:53 UT on 4 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191104B (trigger 594551878.499554 / 191104387).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 294.3, Dec = 18.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 37m, 18d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59.0 degrees.
