and A.P. Beardmore report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 210820A (Beardmore et al.
GCN Circ. 30664), from 131 s to 18.2 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 339 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 30667).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.9 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.9 (+0.6, -0.5).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.77 (+/-0.03). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.20 (+/-0.11) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.28 (+0.25, -0.13)
and a best-fitting absorption column consistent with the Galactic
value. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 2.9 x 10^-11 (3.3 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.6 (+4.3, -0.0) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.28 (+0.25, -0.13)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.9, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 2.9 x 10^-4 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 8.4 x
10^-15 (9.6 x 10^-15) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
