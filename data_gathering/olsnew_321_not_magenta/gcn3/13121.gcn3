We observed the field of GRB 120326A (GCN 13105) in g, r, i, and z-bands 
with the Lulin 1m telescope operated by IANCU. The observation was
started at 17.2 hrs after the GRB. The optical afterglow (GCN 13107,
13109, 13111) is clearly detected in all of the g,r,i,z-bands. The
afterglow is still keeping the brightness around r = 19.0 (at 18.7 hrs
after the GRB).
