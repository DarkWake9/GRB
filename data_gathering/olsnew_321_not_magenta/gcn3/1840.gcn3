TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1840
SUBJECT: GRB030131: Optical limit

FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

P.A. Price (RSAA/ANU) and D.W. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:  

"We have imaged the full localization region of GRB030131 (GCN 1838)
with the Palomar 48-inch Oschin Telescope + NEAT camera, in six 120s
exposures over 10:42 UT to 11:31 UT.  The summed image from these
unfiltered exposures reaches a limiting magnitude of R~21 mag as
estimated from the magnitude of several USNO-A2.0 stars in the image.
We identify no new sources by reference to images from the Second
Digitized Sky Survey.  We estimate the magnitude of any new source to
be R>20 mag at the mean epoch of our observations, 11:16 UT, which is
3.62 hours after the burst."
