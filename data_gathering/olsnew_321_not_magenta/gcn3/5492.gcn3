J. French (UCD Dublin) and P.Kubanek (AsU AV CR Ondrejov & ISDC Versoix)
on behalf of the Watcher collaboration reports:

We observed GRB 060901, detected by INTEGRAL, with 40cm Watcher
telescope, located at Boyden Observatory, South Africa, starting at
20:06:00 UT, 82 min after ISGRI/IBAS detection. At location mention in
GCN Circ. 5491 we do see few sources not present in USNO, which are all
visible on ESO archive plates.

We place conservative limit R 18 mag for any OT from this GRB. Futher
observations and analysis are in progress.
