WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift Trigger 797070 (Troja et al.,
GCN 22254) starting at 04:21:09 UT, 340 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. We do not detect any new source within the 3 arcmin
Swift-BAT error circle (Troja et al., GCN 22254), either in single
image or the co-added images. Due to bad seeing condition, the typical
limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about 17.0 mag
calibrated to the APASS catalog, and the co-added image from 10 clear
band images is about 17.5 mag.
