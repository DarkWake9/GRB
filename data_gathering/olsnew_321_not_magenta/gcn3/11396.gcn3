D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF- Milano), E. Bozzo,  
V. Savchenko, C. Ferrigno, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski  
(CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:
a long gamma ray burst lasting about 10 s has been detected by IBAS in  
the IBIS/ISGRI data at 22:10:24 U.T. on November 12th.
Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A. =  292.218347 (deg)
Dec. = +39.359032 (deg)

with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a 20-200 keV fluence of about  6e-7 erg/ 
cm2 and a peak flux of about 1.6 ph/cm2 s  (1 s integration time).

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
