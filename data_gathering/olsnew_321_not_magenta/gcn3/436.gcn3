report:

"We have obtained sixteen exposures of the BeppoSAX position of
GRB 991106 (Gandolfi et al. GCN 435) with the 1.5-m telescope at
the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (IAA-CSIC) near Granada.  The
images were taken starting 9.1-hr after the event (Nov 6.83-6.97 UT)
through R- and I-band filters. After a visual comparison with the
Digital Sky Survey, no sources varying by more than 0.3 mag were
seen to the DSS limit within the BSAX WFC error box."
