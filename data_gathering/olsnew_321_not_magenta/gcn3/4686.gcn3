(DARK Cosmology Centre), Jyri Naeraenen (Helsinki Observatory) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Using ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope we have obtained
a spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 060206 (GCN #4682, 4683, #4684).
The spectrum shows a rich Lyman-alpha forest as well as metal lines
from the GRB host/environment. We still do not have a formal
wavelength calibration, but a preliminary analysis indicates
a redshift close to 5."
