The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:35:03.51 UT on 17 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201217A (trigger 629865308 / 201217108).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 273.3, Dec = -65.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 13m, -65d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 82.0 degrees.
