TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4991
SUBJECT: GRB 060418: prediction of t_break

G. Ghisellini, G. Ghirlanda and F. Tavecchio report:

The long GRB 060418 detected by Swift (Falcone et al. GCN 4966;
Cummings et al. GCN 4975) whose spectral parameters have been reported
by Golenetskii et al. (GCN 4989), as observed by Konus-Wind, is
consistent with the E_peak-E_iso (Amati) correlation.  If the light
curve will show a break at t=3+-1 days, this burst would also be
consistent with the E_p-E_gamma (Ghirlanda) relation. Therefore
multiwavelength observations are encouraged.
