A. Cucchiara & D. B. Fox (PSU) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Starting on 2008 March 30.35 UT we used the Marcario LRS spectrograph
on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (R ~ 230 ) to obtain 2 x 1000s spectra
of the optical afterglow (Mao et al., GCN 7537) of GRB 080330. The
spectrum covers the wavelength range 4100 to 10,500 Angstrom. We
observe multiple metal absorption features including the MgII doublet
(2796, 2803 A) and MgI (2852 A), FeII (2586, 2600 A), ZnII (2026 A)
and NiII (1741,1751 A) at redshift z = 1.51.  Our observations are
consistent with the redshift and features reported by Malesani et
al. (GCN 7544)."
