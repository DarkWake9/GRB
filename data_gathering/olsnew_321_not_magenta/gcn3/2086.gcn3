Report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 030329,
(=H2656, Vanderspek et al. GCN 1997), identified
by Peterson & Price (GCN 1985) and Torii (GCN 1986),
in the Johnson B-Band with the SARA 0.9m telescope at 
KPNO. We obtained 30, 300s exposures.  Observations
began at 03:30:39UT, and ended at 06:15:07UT, on April
2nd.  The obsevations were carried out under partial
cloud cover and relatively windy conditions.  
Aperture photometry is being carried out, and further 
observations are planned.
