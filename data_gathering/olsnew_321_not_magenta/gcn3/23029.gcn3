The long GRB 180723A (Fermi-GBM trigger #554062193) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 18:09:45.493 UTC on 23 July 2018.
This GRB is also clearly seen by the publicly available INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS light curve.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a FRED-like pulse which starts
at T+2.4 sec, peaks at T+4.9 sec, and ends at T+14.5 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
10.0 +- 1.3 sec and 4.3 +- 0.7 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
