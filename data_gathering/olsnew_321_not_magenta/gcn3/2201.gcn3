(Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We have observed the full error box of GRB030501 (Mereghetti et al. 2003, 
GCN 2183) using the Wise observatory 1m telescope + SITe CCD camera,
starting 2003, May 2nd, 00:05 UT (16.5 hours after the burst).
Two 600s R-band frames were obtained.

Comparison of the images with the POSS-II E plate
reveals no new optical sources, to a limiting magnitude
of R=20.0, within the INTEGRAL error circle.
