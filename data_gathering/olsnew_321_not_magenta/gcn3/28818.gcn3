report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

Further analysis of Swift trigger 1003313 (previously reported
as GRB 201031A; Laha et al., CGN Circ. 28814) using
the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec shows that
the BAT image significance has now decreased to 2.6 sigma
(15-350 keV). Also, the mask-weighted light curve does not
show anything significant.

We thus conclude that this event is due to noise,
and is not an astrophysical event.
