The long-duration, intense GRB 190103A
(AGILE/MCAL detection: Ursi et al., GCN 23600;
AstroSat CZTI detection: Khanam et al., GCN 23609;
IPN triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN 23646)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=60113.215 s UT (16:41:53.215).

The burst light curve shows two emission episodes
with a total duration of ~33 s.
The emission is seen up to ~16 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 7.14(-0.65,+0.68)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+21.648 s,
of 2.00(-0.30,+0.32)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+32.512 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 16 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.90(-0.07,+0.07),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.41(-0.24,+0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 304(-26,+28) keV,
chi2 = 85/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate
(measured from T0+21.504 to T0+24.320 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 3 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.76(-0.08,+0.09),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.39(-0.31,+0.20),
the peak energy Ep = 396(-46,+50) keV,
chi2 = 49/62 dof.
