and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 141202A has been observed by Fermi 
(GBM trigger 439211828), MESSENGER (GRNS), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), 
Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 40626 s UT (11:17:06). 
This burst occurred just after Swift started a preplanned slew maneuver. 
There are no BAT event data covering the burst interval, but from the 
energy response of the quadrant rates, it appears that the source was 
partially coded in BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   143.073 (09h 32m 17s) +54.161 (+54d 09' 38")
  Corners:
   142.732 (09h 30m 56s) +52.555 (+52d 33' 17")
   143.092 (09h 32m 22s) +53.247 (+53d 14' 51")
   143.397 (09h 33m 35s) +55.706 (+55d 42' 22")
   143.039 (09h 32m 09s) +55.054 (+55d 03' 15")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1439 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 3.2 deg (the minimum one is 10 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 117 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
