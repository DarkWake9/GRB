Boer M., Siellez K., Dereli H., Bardho O. (UNS-CNRS-OCA),
Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:


We imaged the field of GRB 131108A detected by Fermi-LAT and Fermi-GBM 
(Racusin et al., GCN 15646) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern Observatory, France.

The observations started about 22700s after the GRB trigger (3:00 UT on 
2013-11-09), when the object started to be visible. The weather 
conditions were poor, with only one sequence of 6 images being not cloudy.

We detect the afterglow reported by Stroh et al. (GCN 15468) and 
Gorosabel et al. (GCN 15469), with a magnitude of R = 17.8 +/- 0.2.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
