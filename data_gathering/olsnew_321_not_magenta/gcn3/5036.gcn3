V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), V.Biryukov (SAI, MSU), and A.Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf
of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the optical afterglow (Price et al. GCN5019; Li et al. GCN5027)
of Swift GRB060428B (Campana et al. GCN 5017) in the R band with Shajn  2.6m
telescope of CrAO between April 28 (UT) 18:43 -- 20:41, i.e. 9.8 -- 11.8 hrs
after the burst onset. The afterglow is visible on a combined image of a
total exposure 3240 sec in a tail of the nearby galaxy (Halpern  et al.
GCN5034) and precise photometry is underway. Based on USNO A2.0 we estimate
limiting magnitude of the combined image as R=24.3.
