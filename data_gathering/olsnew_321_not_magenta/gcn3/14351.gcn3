SUBJECT: GRB 130306A: Confirmation of the X-ray Afterglow

M. H. Siegel (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift performed a follow-up observation of the possible X-ray afterglow of
the BAT-detected GRB 130306A (Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 14287).  A 5 ks
observation took place on 14 March 2013, eight days after the burst.  
The reported source faded by at least a factor of three, from .009
counts s^-1 (observed flux 4.2 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1) to an upper
limit of of .003 counts s^-1 (observed flux 1.5 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1).
We therefore confirm that this was the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130306A.
