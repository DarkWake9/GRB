The long GRB 220715A (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: Fermi GBM team,
GCN Circ. 32399; AGILE/MCAL detection: Ursi et al., GCN Circ 32401) triggered the 
CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 08:49:37.333 UTC on 15 July 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1341910167/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by only SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a weak signal which starts
at T+0.8 sec, peaks at T+3.8 sec, and ends at T+12.7 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 10.0 +/- 2.0 sec
and 6.0 +/- 2.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
