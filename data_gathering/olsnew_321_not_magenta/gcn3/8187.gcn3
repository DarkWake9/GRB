Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080905A (trigger #323870)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 8180).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 287.663, -18.865 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 10m 39.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -18d 51' 55.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 56%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows three peaks; the first two are partially
overlapping, starting at T+0.0 and ending at ~T+0.4 sec.  The third peak
starts at ~T+0.6 and ends at ~T+1.3 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.0 +- 0.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+1.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.85 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
