The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:17:04 UT on 1 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210401A (trigger 639011829.029182 / 210401970).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 263.1, Dec = -31.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 32m, -31d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 98.0 degrees.
