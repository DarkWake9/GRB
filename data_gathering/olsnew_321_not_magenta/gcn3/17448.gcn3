We observed the field of GRB 150211A detected by Swift (trigger #630714; 
Starling et al., GCN Circ. 17434) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T11 (0.50 m Plane Wave) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory (NM, USA).  
20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from February 11 12:06:11 (UT) 
about 14.3 minutes after the trigger and stopped on February 11 12:32:17 (UT).  
We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked image 
at the enhanced X-ray afterglow position (Starling et al., GCN Circ. 17442).  The estimated 
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec) is ~19.1 using 
the USNO-B1 catalog.
