B. E. Cobb (GWU) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 120404A
(GCN 13208, Stratta et al.) with a mid-exposure time of 17.4 hours
post-burst (2012-04-05 06:13 UT).  Total summed exposure
times amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

No source is detected at the position of the optical
afterglow (e.g. GCN 13208, Stratta et al.; GCN 13209, Guidorzi
et al.) to approximate limiting magnitudes of I > 21.6 and J > 19.6.
Magnitudes are calibrated using USNO-B1.0 stars in I, and 2MASS
stars in J.
