G. Kornienko, A. Erofeeva (UAFO), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB 
follow up collaboration report:

We observed the error box of  GRB080307 (Holland  et al. GCN 7362) on March 
05 with SR-22 telescope of UAFO observatory. A set of 20 unfiltered images 
of 60 s exposure was obtained starting (UT) 11:36:55, i.e. 13.5 minutes 
after burst onset. No new object is detected within enhanced XRT error 
circle (Goad et al. GCN 7366). Based on USNO-A2.0 (R) we estimated upper 
limit as following

T0+           Exposure     UL
(mid)
23.5 m        10x60 s      18.8
