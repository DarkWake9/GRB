The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:23:21 UT on 25 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210625A (trigger 646349006.139788 / 210625891).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 247.5, Dec = -41.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 30m, -41d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 26.0 degrees.
