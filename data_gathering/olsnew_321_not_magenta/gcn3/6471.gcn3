   K.S. Baliyan, S. Ganesh  and  Priyanksha (MIRO-PRL, Ahmedabad,
   India) report:
   
   We observed the field around the location of GRB070529 (18h 54m 
   58.19s,  20d 39' 34.0"), BAT trigger no. 280706, at 14:48:28 UT 
   as reported by S. T. Holland  on behalf of the Swift Team (GCN 6466).

   We started observations at 18:10:08 UT with 1296*1152 CCD  mounted on 
   the 1.2 M  telescope of the Mt. Abu IR Observatory, 
   Gurushikhar, Mount Abu, Rajasthan, operated by Physical 
   Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad- India, in VR bands. A total of 12 
   images of 180 seconds exposure in R and 5 images in V band were 
   taken. The visual inspection shows a very faint source near the above
   location in a very crowded field. Details will be reported after 
   proper analysis of all the images.
