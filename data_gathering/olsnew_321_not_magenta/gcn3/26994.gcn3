The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:17:23 UT on 5 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200205C (trigger 602626648.328424 / 200205845).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 223.2, Dec = -42.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 52m, -42d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
