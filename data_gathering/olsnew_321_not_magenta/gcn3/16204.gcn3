At 14:13:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on a peak
in an image (trigger=597860).  Swift slewed immediately to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 199.681, -35.631 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 18m 43s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 37' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger,
there is no obvious variation in the BAT light curve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 14:16:14.9 UT, 139.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in 772 s of promptly downlinked
data. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 142 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.05. 

Due to the marginal detection in BAT (7.06 sigma) with no 
corresponding rate increase, and the lack of a detection  in XRT and
UVOT, we believe that this is probably not  an astrophysical source. 
Final determination of the  reality of the source will require the
full downlinked data. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vxm22 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
