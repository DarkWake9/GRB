WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 140114A (Troja et al.,
GCN 15728) starting at 12:01:57 UT, 257 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
I and clear (roughly R) filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. Within the enhanced XRT error circle (Beardmore
et al., GCN 15733), we do not detect the afterglow reported by
Butler et al. (GCN 15732) in our single images, nor in a co-added
image from the first 5 images. The typical limiting magnitude of
our single clear image is about 19.4. The co-added image limiting
magnitude is 20.6 at a mean time of about 490 s after the burst.
