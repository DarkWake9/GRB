D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

Upon further inspection of the P60 images, we identify a very bright 
optical source separated by about 51 arcseconds from the XRT afterglow 
location but consistent with the optical afterglow location reported by 
Elenin et al. (GCN 14450)   The source is saturated in the early images. 
  Further observations are ongoing.

We also note that there is an SDSS galaxy at this position, suggesting a 
low-redshift event.
