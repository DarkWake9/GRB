 S. Zharikov, G. Tovmassian (OAN SPM IA UNAM, Ensenada, Mexico)
 report:
 
 We have observed the OT GRB030329 found by B.Peterson and P.Price (GCN 
 1985) using 1.5m telescope of OAN-SPM Observatory, BC, Mexico. 
A set of exposures in VR Bessel filters was obtained  of 2 June under 
photometric and good seeing conditions.  
Based on field photometry by A. Henden (GCN 2082) 
we estimate OT (or its host galaxy?)  magnitudes:

2 June
 <Tobs>      Texp.   Filter  Mag.
 
 UT 6:00    2400sec   V    21.86(10)
 UT 5:15    3000sec   R    21.42(7)

The R magnitude no changed during 20 May up to 2 June.
