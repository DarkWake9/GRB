P. Romano, C. Guidorzi(Uni-Bicocca and OAB), A. Moretti(OAB),
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using all data collected by Swift/XRT obtained for GRB 070724B
detected by SuperAGILE (Feroci et al., GCN Circ. 6668),
for a total of 16.5 ks (between T+19.1 hours and T+7.5 days),
we can now confirm that the candidate proposed in GCN Circ. 6675
(Romano et al.) is the afterglow of GRB 070724B.
Its final position is RA,DEC(J2000)=17.48477,57.67620, which is

RA(J2000)  =  01 09 56.34
Dec(J2000) = +57 40 34.3

with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This is 0.4 arcsec from the X-ray position given in Romano et
al., GCN Circ. 6675) and 4.6 arcmin from the initial SuperAGILE
position (Feroci et al., GCN Circ. 6668).
The light curve can be fit with a power-law power-law with
slope of 1.19+0.23-0.19 (90% cl).
No further observations with Swift are planned.
