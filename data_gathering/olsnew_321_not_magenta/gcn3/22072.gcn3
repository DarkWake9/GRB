S. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

On 29 Oct 2017 at 19:21 and 19:28 UT, Swift BAT triggered twice
while Swift J0243.6+6124 (784159 and 784160) was in the BAT field of view
during an interval when the attitude information was not available.
The triggers are not astrophysical and the reported locations are not accurate.
Please disregard these two triggers.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
