collaboration report:

The 2-m LCOGT Faulkes Telescope North began observing Swift GRB 160104A 
(Melandri et al. GCN 18815) on January 04, 11:50:08 UT (26 minutes after 
the burst trigger) with SDSS R and I filters. Within the XRT error 
circle we detect an uncatalogued source at the following position:

RA(J2000)=   05:07:11.058
DEC(J2000)= +11:19:25.4

with R~19 mag as calibrated against nearby USNOB-1 stars.
