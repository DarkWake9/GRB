DATE:    18/11/26 10:23:20 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 181126A, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 152.3477, -29.6875
which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 10 09 23.46
   Dec (J2000) = -29 41 15.0
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence).
Analysis of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/873539.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
