P.A. Price (IfA), N. Morell (La Plata, Argentina), S.R. Kulkarni 
(Caltech) and J. Fulbright (OCIW) report:

We have observed the error circle of the INTEGRAL GRB 040106 (GCN 
#2505) with the Swope 40-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, 
commencing at Jan 7.32 UT.  Observations consisted of 2x600 sec 
exposures in the Washington T2 filter (central wavelength ~ 8000A) and 
cover the entire INTEGRAL error circle to a limiting magnitude of 
approximately R ~ 21 mag.

Within the XMM error circle (GCN #2508), we identify four sources, two 
of which are present in the Second Digitised Sky Survey images.  The 
other two sources are likely at too faint a level to appear in the 
DSS2.  The coordinates of these are:

(a)	11:52:12.56   -46:47:15.3   J2000   R ~ 20.7 mag
(b)	11:52:13.87   -46:47:06.5   J2000   R ~ 20.5 mag   (edge)

Position errors are approximately 0.4".  Estimated (statistical) 
magnitude errors are 0.2 mag.

This message may be cited.

[GCN OPS NOTE (31 Mar 04): The erroneous "030106" date was changed
to the correct "040106" data in the Subject line and in the first line
of the body of the Circular.]
