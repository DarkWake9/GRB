W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 060610 detected with Swift
(Trigger 214277). A combination of filters is used: V, I, 
and clear. The first 15 s unfiltered image started at 06:53:38
UT, 37.1s after the burst. Our automatic image processing pipeline 
identified several new sources relative to the DSS II red 
image (probably due to the proper motion of the stars in the
dense field), but none of them show apparent variable behavior.
Furthermore, image subtraction between the images taken between 
1 and 45 minutes after the burst show no variable source within
the BAT error radius. We set the following limiting magnitudes
(calibrated to USNO B1.0 catalog):

start UT    Exposure    Filter    Limiting mag

06:53:38    15 s        clear     17.7
06:54:37    15 s        I         17.5
06:55:03    20 s        clear     17.8
06:55:34    45 s        V         16.6
06:56:31    45 s        I         17.6
06:57:26    45 s        clear     18.0

More observations and analysis are in progress.
