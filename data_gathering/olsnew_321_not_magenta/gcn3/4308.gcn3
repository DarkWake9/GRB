behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the error box of  GRB051117b (Band et al., GCN 4281) with 1.5m
telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory. Set of  R images were taken
between Oct.17 (UT) 21:31 - 21:54. No  source is detected in refined XRT
error box (Beardmore et al., GCN 4304). We do not detect the extended source
mentioned by Chen et al. in GCN 4285.

Preliminary estimation of upper limit against of  USNO A2.0 is following:

Mid time,      Exposure, Filter, Mag.
(UT)            (s)

Nov.17 21:46   1080       R      21.0 (3 sigma UL)
