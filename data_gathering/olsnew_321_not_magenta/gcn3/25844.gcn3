and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190924h,
T0 = 2019-09-24 02:18:46.847 UT (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25829), the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) high voltages were off (from T0-1 min to 
T0+16 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high energy
trigger mode at the trigger time of S190924h. Using the CAL data,
we have searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from
-60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no candidates.
There is no significant overlap with the high probability 
localization region.  The CAL FOV was centered at RA=273.4 deg,
Dec=40.2 deg at T0.
