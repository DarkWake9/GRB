Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130625A (trigger #558982)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 14923).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 343.336, 82.171 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 53m 20.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +82d 10' 17.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks starting at ~T-25sec,
peaking at ~T+3 sec, and ending at ~T+60 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
38.1 +- 4.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-28.17 to T+18.50 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.37 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.54 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
