We analyzed GRB 211023A (Di Lalla et al. GCN 30961; Lesage et al. GCN 
30965; Ursi et al. GCN 30969; Ridnaia et al. GCN 31022) using publicly 
available data of GBM/Fermi and SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL.

Using GBM/Fermi we clearly detect early emission, starting about 80 s 
before the GBM trigger. The extended emission (possibly associated with 
the activity detected by LAT, Di Lalla et al. GCN 30961, and/or its 
extremely bright afterglow, Zhirkov et al. GCN 30977; Kann et al. GCN 
30982) was also found, becoming dominant since approximately 150 s the 
trigger. Thus, a time profile consists of three episodes with a total 
burst duration of more than 300 s in GBM/Fermi (7 - 850 keV), while T90 
= 117 +/- 0.5 s. GRB 211023A was also registered by SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL 
with marginal detection of the early and the extended emission (T90 = 
120 +/- 9 s). Time profiles of GBM and SPI-ACS are presented at

We performed spectral analysis of the burst using GBM/Fermi data in the 
time interval of (-20, 160) s after the GBM trigger, covering the main 
part of GRB activity. The best parameters of Band model are following: 
Ep = 96 +/- 5 keV, alpha = -1.67 +/- 0.03, beta = -2.21 +/- 0.05 and 
fluence F = (1.341 +/- 0.004)*10^-4 erg/cm^2 in 10 - 1000 keV range. 
Assuming a redshift z = 0.390 (Pozanenko et al., GCN 31053) we estimated 
Eiso = (7.45 +/- 0.05)*10^52 erg in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy band.

The position of the burst at Ep,i - Eiso and T90,i - EH diagram [1,2] is 
shown by black annuli at

and

The position is typical for type II (long) GRBs, although it is in the 
lower bound of their 2 sigma correlation region. This is because of its 
relatively low value of the Ep,i parameter. Note that low values of Ep,i 
are typical for the nearby bursts (z < 0.5), associated with supernovae 
(shown by red annuli at
