R.L.C. Starling (U. Leicester) and M. Stamatikos (GSFC/ORAU) report on behalf
of the Swift XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the field of possible GRB 080130 (Copete et al., GCN 7242)
found in the BAT Slew Survey, approximately 11 hours after the burst. In
1.98ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data starting 2008-01-30:22:21 and ending
2008-01-30:22:54 we find one possible X-ray source inside the BATSS error
circle, detected at the 3-sigma level at RA,Dec=261.61657,-53.18878 deg 
and equivalent to:

RA (J2000)= 17h 26m 27.98s
Dec(J2000)= -53d 11' 19.6"

with an uncertainty of 8.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is 2.1 arcmin
from the reported BATSS position.
At this stage we cannot tell if the source is fading or not and we have no
spectral information.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
