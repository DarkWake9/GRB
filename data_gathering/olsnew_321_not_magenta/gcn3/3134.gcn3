Continued analysis of the available data for the Swift-BAT GRB 050318
(Krimm, et al., GCN 3111) yields the following additional results.
Due to an error in an on-board data processing script, event data
from times after T+31.4 seconds were not recorded.  Based on analysis
of the rate data, we estimate that the lost event data represent
about 18 per cent of the total burst flux.  The fluence derived from the
available event data and scaled to cover the entire burst is
2.1 X 10^-6 erg/cm^2 in the 15-350 keV band.  The 1-s peak flux
is 3.8 ph/cm^2/s (also 15-350 keV).  The photon index of the 1-s
peak spectrum (T+28.5 s) is 1.9 +/- 0.12 (90% confidence).
The time averaged spectrum yields a photon index of 2.1 +/- 0.11
(90% confidence).  The overall measure of burst duration
is T90 = 32 +/- 2 s (including systematics).
