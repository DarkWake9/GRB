The long-duration GRB 140213A
(Swift-BAT trigger 586569: Holland et al., GCN 15825;
Stamatikos et al., GCN 15836;
Fermi GBM Detection: Zhang, GCN 15833)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=69693.011 s UT (19:21:33.011).

The burst light curve shows a bright, double-peaked pulse with
a total duration of ~16 s followed by a weaker emission during
the next ~50 s.
The emission is seen up to ~12 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140213_T69693/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (1.57 ± 0.09)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+1.344 s,
of (4.10 ± 0.40)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.39 ± 0.06,
the high energy photon index beta = -3.55 ± 0.88,
the peak energy Ep = 100 ± 4 keV,
chi2 = 142/97 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.46 ± 0.12,
the high energy photon index beta = -3.28 ± 0.40,
the peak energy Ep = 108 ± 4 keV,
chi2 = 137/97 dof.

Assuming the redshift z=1.2076 (Schulze et al., GCN 15831),
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,
Omega_M = 0.27, and Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters:
the isotropic energy release E_iso is (6.2 ± 0.4)x10^52 erg,
the peak luminosity L_iso is (3.6 ± 0.4)x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy Ep,i = (221 ± 8) keV

All errors are given at 1 sigma level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
