TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  981
SUBJECT: GRB010220, Optical Observations

G. G. Williams, R. Uglesich, Mike Bradshaw (Steward Observatory), H. S.
Park (LLNL), D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report on behalf of the
LOTIS collaboration.

We observed the BeppoSAX error box of GRB010220 (GCNs 953, 956) with the
0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope between Feb. 21.223 and Feb. 21.262 or 6.50 to
7.45 hours after the burst.  Comparison between the sum of 11 unfiltered
images (total time of t~1360 s) and the DSS-II red scan revealed no
candidate optical counterpart brighter than m~20.2.  Image subtraction
between the first and second half of the observations revealed no new
variable source within the error box.
 
Additional images obtained beginning Feb 22.16 (28.95 hours after the
burst) also reveal no counterpart, however the analysis is still in
progress.
