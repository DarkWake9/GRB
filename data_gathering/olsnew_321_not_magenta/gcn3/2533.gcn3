R. Gonzalez-Riestra and P. Rodriguez-Pascual from the

XMM-Newton SOC report:

Preliminary EPIC-pn images, light-curves and spectra

from the XMM-Newton observation of the field of

GRB 040223 are available at the home-page of the

XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre:

http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb040223/index.shtml

The XMM-EPIC exposure started less than 5 hours after

the occurrence of the outburst, this being the fastest

XMM-Newton ToO response to date. The light curve of the

source reported in GCN 2530, XMMU J163929.9-415601, is

highly variable, decreasing from 0.08 to 0.03 counts/sec

(0.3-9 keV) during the 42 ksec of the observation.

The EPIC-pn spectrum of XMMU J163929.9-415601 is absorbed

below 1 keV, consistent with a Hydrogen column density

of 1.7E22 cm-2.  The observed flux in the 2-10 keV band

is approximately 2.4E-13 erg cm-2 s-1.
