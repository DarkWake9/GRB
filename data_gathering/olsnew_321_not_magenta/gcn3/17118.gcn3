E. Mazaeva (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI), I. Korobtsev 
(ISTP), M. Eselevich (ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) Nov., 29  starting on 
(UT) 20:20:38.  We obtained several  images in R-filter under 
unfavorable seeing. In a combined image we detect optical  afterglow 
(Tanga et al., GCN 17078; Perley et al., GCN 17081).

A preliminary photometry of the OT is based on nearby SDSS DR9 stars:

2014-11-29 20:20:38   8.7458   R        84*120  22.03 0.17

Due to bad seeing the photometry above includes both afterglow and 
possible host (Watson et al., GCN 17105; Mazaeva et al., GCN 17111).
