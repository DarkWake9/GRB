NUMBER:  3696
SUBJECT: GRB050724: Refined Radio Position
DATE:    05/07/28 20:07:36 GMT
FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie collaboration:

"Further observations of the radio afterglow (GCN 3676, 3684)
of GRB050724 (GCN 3665) have allowed for a position to be derived
with increased astrometric accuracy:

RA (J2000)   16 24 44.369    ±  0.007s
DEC (J2000) -27 32 27.5      ±   0.2"

which is consistent with the position of the optical transient
(GCN 3681, 3690)."
