Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR)  and A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR) report on 
behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We carried out the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
GRB 160131A (GCN Circ. 18951) at 1280 and 610 MHz band on 2016 Feb 09.61 
UT.
The data is badly affected by RFI and hence we could not obtain the 
expected rms.
The 3-sigma upper limit on the GRB flux in the Swift error cicle (GCN 
Circ.  18970)
are  570  and 382 uJy in 1280 and 610 MHz bands, respectively.

The GMRT data for GRB 160131A is public for anyone to use.

Further observations are planned.  We thank GMRT staff for making these 
observations possible.
