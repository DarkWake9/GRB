GBM was observing 69% of the LIGO probability map for G275697 at the
event time, with about half of the northern high probability region and all
of
the southern arc observed. There is no GBM on-board trigger around the
event time. The untargeted ground-based search of GBM data for
short-duration GRBs (Briggs et al., in prep) found no candidates close in
time to G275697, though it has only run through 19:00.
The targeted search of the GBM data ([1], [2]) also did not
find a significant gamma-ray signal. This search processes time scales of
0.256 to 8.192 s within 30 s of the LIGO event. No interesting gamma-ray
candidate was found within this time window.

Any prompt gamma-ray burst emission, above the GBM detection threshold,
must have been occulted by the Earth for Fermi.  The Earth-occulted region
is a circle with radius of 68 degrees, centered on RA, Dec = 326.9, -22.8.

Further analysis and upper limits will be reported later.
