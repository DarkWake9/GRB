O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:13:18.62  UT on the 29th October 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 141029B
(trigger 436245201 / 141029134). The trigger resulted in an
Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was accepted and the
spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 105.2, DEC = +25.1, with an uncertainty
of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 42 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a multiple episodes with a
duration (T90) of about 202.4 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-12.2 s to T0+190.5 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.36 +/- 0.03 and the cutoff energy,
parameterised as Epeak, is 191 +/-13 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.800 +/- 0.10)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+78.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 20.3 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
