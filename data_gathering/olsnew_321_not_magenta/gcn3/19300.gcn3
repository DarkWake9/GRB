D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), T. Kuutma (NOT and Tartu 
Obs.), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed again the optical counterpart of GRB 160410A (Gibson et al., 
GCN 19271) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. 
Observations started on April 11.87 UT and consisted of 4x900 s 
exposures in the SDSS r band.

At a mid time of 40.37 hr after the GRB, we do not detect any longer the 
optical afterglow down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of r > 25 (AB), 
calibrated against nearby SDSS stars. The corresponding decay index (F 
propto t^-alpha) between our two NOT observations (Malesani & 
Kirkpatrick, GCN 19925) is constrained to be alpha > 0.9. The object 
closest to the GRB position (with r ~ 24) lies 4.7" away, so we cannot 
single out any obvious host galaxy candidate to the GRB, down to the 
quoted limiting magnitude.
