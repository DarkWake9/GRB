A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir, K. Wiersema (U. Leicester), O. Hartoog (Amsterdam), K. Kolle, J. Mendez (ING) and T. Kupfer (Nijmegan) report for a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 130603B (Melandri et al. GCN 14735) with the William Herschel Telescope, beginning at 21:39 UT approximately 5.8 hours after the burst. In our z and r-band observations we identify a galaxy present in the SDSS DR9 observations of the field with a magnitude of r=20.94.  In addition we identify a point-like source, offset approximately 1" to the SW of this source, with an approximate (+/- 1") position of;

RA(J2000) 11 28 48.16
DEC(J2000) +17:04:18.0

This source is blended with the SDSS galaxy, but appears to be brighter. We suggest this is likely to be the optical afterglow of GRB 130603B."
