J. Norris, A. Kutyrev (NASA/GSFC), R. Ganguly, R. Canterna,
and M. Pierce (U. Wyoming) report:

We observed the refined XRT error box reported by Hurkett et al. (GCN 4740)
for the very long burst, GRB 060211a (Swift trigger #181126; Hurkett et al.
GCN 4736; Krimm et al. GCN 4757) with the 2.3-meter WIRO telescope.

Observations commenced at 2006/02/12 02:44 UT (17 hrs after the burst)
and continued until 03:24 UT.  We obtained thirty-six 50-s integrations
in the J band under poor seeing conditions.  In the stacked image,
no source was detected within the XRT error circle to a limit of
J = 19.1  (3-sigma upper limit).
