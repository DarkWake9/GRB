The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:06:31 UT on 7 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200607B (trigger 613260396.424964 / 200607921).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 41.3, Dec = -83.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 45m, -83d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
