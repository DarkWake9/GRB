report:

We observed the location of GRB 160327A (Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 19235) 
using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James Clerk 
Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 10:24 UT on 2016-03-27, 
corresponding to 68 minutes after the burst trigger.  Exposures totaling 
1.0 hours were made in good weather conditions.  No source was detected, 
with the RMS background noise being 2.0 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 
26.0 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Callie Matulonis and Iain Coulson for the prompt support of 
these observations that were taken under project M16AP005.
