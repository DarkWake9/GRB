The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:


We have re-analyzed LIGO and Virgo data around the time of the compact
binary coalescence (CBC) candidate S190426c (GCN 24237). Parameter
estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky
map, lalinference.fits.gz, is available for retrieval from the
GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190426c/

For the lalinference.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 1131
deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity
distance estimate is 377 +/- 100 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation). This is the preferred sky map at this time.

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents
of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
