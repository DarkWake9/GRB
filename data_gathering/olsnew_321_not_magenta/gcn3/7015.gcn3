L.P. Xin, M. Zhai, Y.L. Qiu, J.Y. Wei, J.Y. Hu, J.S. Deng,
J. Wang and W.K. Zheng on behalf of EAFON report:

We have imaged the field of GRB071028 (J. L. Racusin, GCN7012 ; J. Cummings, 
GCN7013; J. Racusin, GCN7014) with EST 1m telescope at Xinglong Observatory. 
The observations were started from  17:57:16 UT, 16.25min after the burst. 
A series of V-band images were obtained . No new source was found in our 
combined images within the error region of the XRT (J. L. Racusin, GCN7012)
but We found the location reported by J. Racusin(GCN7014) was consisting with 
a very bright star in USNO-B1.0.

The 3 sigma limit of our V-band combined images derived from USNO-B1.0 R2mag 
were :
