At 06:30:28.620 UTC on 31 August 2019, the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) triggered on short GRB 190831B. The burst signal was mainly seen by
the SGM detector.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger
because the real-time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal).

This short burst also triggered INTEGRAL SPI-ACS (trigger #8366).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts at T-0.6 sec,
peaks at T-0.4 sec and ends at T+0.2 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 0.7 +- 0.2 sec and 0.4 +- 0.2 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
