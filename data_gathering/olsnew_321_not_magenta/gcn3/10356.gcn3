The long GRB 100119A (Swift-BAT trigger=383063:
Mangano et al., GCN 10348) triggered Konus-Wind
at T0=66306.167s UT (18:25:06.167)

The burst light curve shows a complex structure
with a total duration of ~45 s.
The emission is seen up to several MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB100119_T66306/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 6.1(+/-0.3)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+18.176s
of 4.3(+/-0.3)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+37.376 s) is well be fitted
in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a power law
with GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.73 (-0.08,+0.09),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.8(-1.9, +0.4),
the peak energy Ep = 377(-35, +35)keV (chi2 = 66/97 dof).

The spectrum of the most intense part of the burst
(measured from T0+15.360 to T0+21.504 s) is well fitted
in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.52(+/-0.11),
and Ep = 387(-32, +37) keV (chi2 = 97/96 dof).

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
