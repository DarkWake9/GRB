on behalf of the SVOM Gravitational Astronomy group report:

We observed about 1200 square degree (3 sky regions) of the skymap
of the advanced LIGO trigger G274296, with SVOM/Mini-GWAC, at Xinglong
Observatory of NAOC equipped with U9000 camera (FOV~400 square
degree/camera).
SVOM/Mini-GWAC comprises 12 wide field angle cameras (aperture=7cm),
working with unfiltered band. The observations are operated in time-series
mode, taking one exposure in 15 seconds (10s exposure + 5s readout).
The limit magnitude is ~12 mag in R band. We estimate a 52% prior
probability that these 3 regions contain the true location of the
source.

The coordinates of the 3 regions and observation time are list following:

start-obs(UTC) end-obs(UTC) Ra Dec Camera_ID

The first image was taken ~6 hours 20 minutes after the event trigger.
Note that the observations on Feb. 18th. have been done under poor
weather conditions. The limit magnitude is ~10 mag in R band.
No any significant transient is found in our online pipeline. The
image analysis is ongoing in detailed processing with our offline
pipeline.
