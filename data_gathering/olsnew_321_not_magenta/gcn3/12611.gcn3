K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and T. Sakamoto (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift performed a second follow-up observation of the GBM/BAT-detected 
burst, GRB 111201A (Sakamoto et al., GCN Circ. 12608; Kennea & Sakamoto, 
GCN Circ. 12609), collecting a further 3 ks of data between 92.2 and 97.6 
ks after the trigger. This additional observation shows the source to be 
fading with a power-law decay of alpha = 0.55 (+0.22, -0.20), confirming 
it is, indeed, the X-ray afterglow of the burst.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
