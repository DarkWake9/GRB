We observed the field of GRB 210610B (Swift trigger 1054681, K.L. Page et al., GCN Circ. 30170) with the 0.3 m telescope  at University of Siena Observatory (Siena, Italy, K54). The GRB was extensively observed at all wavelengths, including optical photometry from many observatories (see e.g GCN Circulars 30173, 30174, 30175, 30176, 30177, 30178, 30180, 30181, 30185, 30187, 30188, 30190, 30191, 30193).

Our observations began under good weather conditions at 2021-06-10 20:37:53 UT (~0.75 h after GRB onset) with a series of 300s CCD exposures in the Rc filter, that were later added in groups of four for the photometry and further analysis.
The optical afterglow was clearly detected at a sky position in agreement with the UVOT astrometry reported in GCN Circ. 30170.
Our data cover continuously almost 6 hours of observations until the field set below the dome horizon. 

The preliminary Rc-band photometry was calibrated with stars from the APASS10 catalog (Henden et al., 2019) after conversion between the two photometric systems with the simple formula from Dymock & Miles (2009) for the CMC15 catalog: Rc=r’-0.22. Measurements are not corrected for galactic extinction. Reported uncertainties are statistical only.

The first and last measurements of our series are reported hereafter:

2021-06-10 h. 20:50 UT JD 2459376.368287, R = 16.83 ± 0.04
2021-06-11 h. 02:26 UT JD 2459376.601458, R = 17.52 ± 0.16

The evolution of the brightness is, within the limits of our precision, compatible with a single decay rate with index alpha=0.25 ± 0.04
