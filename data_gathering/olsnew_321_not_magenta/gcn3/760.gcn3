S. Golenetskii and E. Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB
team, T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, report:

An analysis of the Konus data indicates that the second
error box for this burst (GCN 759) is the correct one, i.e.:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  8 h 25 m 45.53 s     60 o  3 '  46.10 "  (CENTER)
  8 h 29 m 50.81 s     60 o  8 '  47.57 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 25 m 36.30 s     60 o  2 '  32.33 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 25 m 54.77 s     60 o  4 '  59.81 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 21 m 35.82 s     59 o 58 '   8.41 "  (CORNER)

A network problem at GSFC has been delaying the receipt
of the full Konus data set for several days, which explains
why this ambiguity could not be resolved earlier.
