The long soft GRB 070724B localized by SuperAGILE (Feroci et al., GCN 
6668), triggered Konus-Wind at T0=84307.346 s UT (23:25:07.346).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows the main multipeaked pulse
with a total duration of ~50 s followed by a weak pulse
at T-T0 ~102 sec with a duration of ~10 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.80(-0.25, +0.04)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+29.744 s
2.17(-0.45, +0.34)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 500 keV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+49.408 s) can be fitted (in the 20 - 500 keV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 1.15 +/- 0.13
and Ep = 82 +/- 5 keV (chi2 = 40/42 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
