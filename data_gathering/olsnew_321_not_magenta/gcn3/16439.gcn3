D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), B.P.
Gompertz (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), M. de Pasquale
(INAF-IASFPA), A. Maselli  (INAF-IASFPA), V. Mangano (PSU) and V.
D'Elia report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 140622A (D'Elia  et al. GCN
Circ. 16433),  from 103 s to 30.9 ks after the	BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 16434).

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=7.1 (+/-0.9).


If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
7.1, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 5.3 x 10^-21 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00602278.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
