G. Younes (GWU) reports on behalf of the Fermi/GBM magnetar team:

"Magnetar SGR 1935+2154 is recently undergoing an outburst. The source  
has triggered Fermi/GBM thus far 10 times, starting on 2016 May 14. We  
list below the times of these triggers:

(*) GBM triggers simultaneous with reported Swift/BAT triggers from
the source

This is the third detected outburst from the source in less than 2
years (July 2014: Cummmings 2014 GCN 16530, Kaneko et al. 2014 GCN
16577; February 2015: Burrows et al. 2015 GCN 17485, Burns & Younes
2015 GCN 17496).

Detailed analysis of the FERMI GBM bursts detected during all three
outbursts is underway and will be reported elsewhere.

We strongly encourage multi-wavelength follow-up of the source during
this recent outburst."
