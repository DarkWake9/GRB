L. Izzo (DARK/NBI) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 200613A (Bissaldi and Lesage, GCN #27930; Ohno et al., GCN #27931) with the IO:O camera mounted on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain. Observations started on June 19th at 22:00:00 UT (6.687 days after the GRB trigger) and we obtained a series of 10x60s images in the r filter.

The afterglow (Kann et al., GCN #27935; Pozanenko et al., GCN #27937; Izzo et al., GCN #27939; Zhu et al., GCN #27943; Marshall, GCN #27944; Liu et al., GCN #27949; Belkin et al., GCN #27958; Fu et al., GCN #27971; Belkin et al., GCN #27978; Moskvitin et al., GCN #27982; Belkin et al., GCN #27983) is clearly visible in the combined image. We measure a preliminary AB magnitude r = 21.20 +- 0.30 mag (t_mid = 6.770 d) calibrated against Pan-STARRS catalogue stars.
