Johan P. U. Fynbo, Jens Hjorth (DARK Cosmology Centre),
Andrew Levan, Nial Tanvir (University of Hertfordshire),
Kari Nilsson (University of Turku) report:

"Using ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope we have obtained
BRI imaging of the field of the short/hard GRB060121 (GCN #4551)
around Jan 22.05. A visual examination reveals a westward moving
source in the error circle, but no other new sources are
detected in comparison with the SDSS images of the field
(GCN #4554). No known asteroid is expected in the field according
to the JPL Small Body Search and the Harvard Planet Checker.
Further observations are planned."
