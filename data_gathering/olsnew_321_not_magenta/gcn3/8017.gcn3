P. J. Brown (Penn State)  reports on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080723B (Gotz et al.,
GCN Circ. 8002) starting at 2008-07-23 17:05:44, 13.4 ks after
the Integral detection.  We do not find any source in the UVOT
observations at the XRT position of the afterglow (Page, GCN Circ. 8008).
The 3-sigma upper limits for detecting a source at this location in the
co-added images are:

Filter   T_start(s)   T_stop(s)  Exp(s)  Mag(3-sigma upper limit)
v        13790        13836      45      >18.1
b        13551        35434      473     >20.3
u        13500        35220      661     >20.1
uvw1     13405        40586      1538    >20.4
uvm2     13841        13966      124     >18.8
uvw2     13603        35801      735     >20.1

The values quoted above are in the UVOT photometric system
(Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).  They have not been corrected
for the expected high but uncertain Galactic extinction along the
line of sight (Galactic latitude < 5 degrees).
