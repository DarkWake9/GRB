on behalf of Lulin GRB collaboration report:

 We apologize to send multi-part mesage at last report (GCN 2743). 
We submit our report again.
  
 We have observed the optical candidate of GRB040924 reported by Fox
et al. (GCN 2734) with 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory ( National
Central University, Taiwan). We made B, V, R and I-band imaging
observations starting at 14.31 UT (2.3 hrs after the burst).  
 Based on our preliminary analysis, the optical candidate was
detected. The position of the candidate referenced to the USNO-B1.0
are 

 RA = 02:06:22.52, Dec = 16:06:48.5 (J2000)

 with uncertainties of approximately 0.2". 

The R-band magnitude at 18.67 UT (6.7 hrs after the burst) is 21.4
mag. compared with near USNO-B1.0 stars as photometric references.

 Further analysis are in progress."
