(UC Berkeley) report on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

We observed the field of GRB 190427A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 24261) with
the 1-m Nickel telescope located at Lick observatory, California.
Observations started about 4.31 hours after the burst. A total of
5 image in R band were taken with each exposure time of 600s.
No viable counterparts were identified in our images. The limiting
magnitude of our 5 combined image is R~22.0 mag calibrated to the
Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
