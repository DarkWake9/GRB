G. Di Cocco, F. Fuschino, M. Galli, C. Labanti, and M. Marisaldi, on
behalf of the AGILE MCAL team, report:

The short-duration, hard spectrum, intense GRB 140906C has been observed 
by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Swift (BAT), AGILE (MCAL), and 
MESSENGER (GRNS), so far, at about 85869 s UT (23:51:09). The burst was 
outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   314.964 (20h 59m 51s)  +2.354 ( +2d 21' 14")
  Corners:
   315.062 (21h 00m 15s)  +0.809 ( +0d 48' 31")
   314.873 (20h 59m 30s)  +0.650 ( +0d 39' 00")
   314.902 (20h 59m 36s)  +3.944 ( +3d 56' 39")
   315.099 (21h 00m 24s)  +4.119 ( +4d 07' 07")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2273 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 4.6 deg (the minimum one is 12 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 148 deg.

This box can be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
