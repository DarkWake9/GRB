FROM:    Cori Fletcher at USRA  <cfletcher@usra.edu>

C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

The HAWC Burst Monitor detected the burst signal HAWC-201019A (GCN 28709) with the
reported position:

RA: 203.148 deg (J2000)
Dec: 29.717 (J2000)

which was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 14.5 minutes
prior until 14.8 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations are not
constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
