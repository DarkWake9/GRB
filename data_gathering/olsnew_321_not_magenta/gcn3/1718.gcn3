S. R. Kulkarni, E. Berger (Caltech), and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

Our group has been running a large project at the Very Large Array
(VLA) to detect and study radio afterglows.  A list of all bursts
which have been observed from the start of the project can be found
at: http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~dfrail/grb_public.shtml. This list will
be updated on a monthly basis.

We request that those making use of this database acknowledge as
follows "Some (All) of the radio data referred to in this paper were
drawn from the GRB Large Program at the VLA,
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/html/vlahome/largeprop/". We intend to
maintain a list of publications that result from this program (and,
over time, some PR images, etc.)
