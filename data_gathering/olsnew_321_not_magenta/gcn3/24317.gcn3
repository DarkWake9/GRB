Following the detection of the two new transients DG19ytre and DG19kplb 
(Andreoni et al., GCN 24268) within the error area of the GW event 
S190426c (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
24237), we observed the two targets with the 1.5m telescope at the 
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (Spain) in the BVRI-bands, starting on Apr 
27, 20:53 UT. In addition, optical spectra for each target (1200s) 
covering the range 3700-7500 A were obtained with the 10.4m GTC  
telescope equipped with OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) starting on Apr 27, 
21:40 UT.

DG19kplb is found to be in the outskirts of its host galaxy at a 
redshift z = 0.09123. The spectrum resembles that of a broad-line Type 
Ic SN at the same redshift past maximum.

DG19ytre is north of a galaxy at redshift z = 0.1825 and displays Type 
Ia SN features consistent with z = 0.1386.

Therefore none of these two newly reported transients seem to be related 
to the GW event S190426c.

We acknowledge the excellent support from the GTC staff.
