of the Swift Team:

At 12:16:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060801 (trigger=222154).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 213.025, +16.984 {14h 12m 06s, +16d 59' 03"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a short burst
with a duration of about 0.5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.5 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 12:17:18 UT, 63 seconds after the BAT
trigger. The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in
the image but ground processed data reveals an uncatalogued fading 
point source at the following location: 
RA(J2000): 14h 12m 01.5s, Dec(J2000): +16d 58m 55.1s with an estimated 
error of 3.8 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White 
(160-650 nm) filter starting 67 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow  candidate has been found in the initial data products. The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle. The typical
3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. Data for the list of
sources generated on-board are not available at this time. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding 
to E(B-V) of 0.02.
