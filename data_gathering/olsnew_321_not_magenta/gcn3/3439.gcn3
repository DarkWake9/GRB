D. Allen, C. Rodgers and R. Canterna report
on behalf of the RBO Team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the position of the afterglow of GRB 050520
(Gotz et al., GCN 3430; Kennea et al., GCN 3434)
with the Red Buttes Obse rvatory 24-inch telescope
under semi-photometric conditions in VRI bands,
all 10 minutes exposures on  JD2453510.6.  Within a FOV 
of 8 arcmin of the Swift position (GCN 3434)
we do not detect the afterglow or no new source
down to the following limiting values:

10 sigma limiting magnitudes were derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue and 
photometric transformations from Landolt standards.
