James Rhoads (STScI), Andrew Wilson (U Maryland), 
Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann (UFRGS), and Andrew Fruchter (STScI) report:

We observed the field of GRB 000214 in the K' (2.1 micron) filter on
February 15.392 and on February 17.410 using the CTIO 4m Blanco
Telescope + OSIRIS imager, with net integration times of 180 seconds
and 384 seconds respectively.  Both epochs covered the entire BeppoSAX
NFI error circle (Antonelli et al, GCNC 561).

We find no convincingly variable sources down to an approximate first
epoch 5 sigma limiting point source magnitude of K' = 18.15, or 34
microJansky (calibrated by observation of the standard star S071-D).
Assuming a normal, unobscured afterglow spectral index (in the 
range -0.65 to -1.25 for f_nu) implies a corresponding flux limit
of 8 to 17 microJansky at 0.7 micron, or roughly R=21.

The approximate 5 sigma point source limit for the second epoch is K' = 19.1.
