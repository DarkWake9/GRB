"At 21:06:53.03 UT on 15 December 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst  
Monitor
triggered and located GRB 081215B (trigger 251068014 / 081215.880).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 244.8, DEC = -45.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 16h19m, -45d20'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.9  
degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally
a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 112 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of two peaks, each with a duration  
of ~10 seconds, at T0
and ~T0+80 seconds, with little emission in between.
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.3 s to T0+7.9 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.14 +/- 0.26 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 139 +/- 14 keV.
The event fluence (50-300 keV) in this time interval is
(2.8 +/- 0.5)E-06 erg/cm^2.

The spectral and temporal analysis results presented above are  
preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
