P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:08:57.40 UT on December 22 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst 
Monitor triggered and located 
GRB 141222A (trigger 440924940/141222298), which was also detected
by  Fermi/LAT (J. McEnery et al. 2014, GCN 17218).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with
the Fermi/LAT location.

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 
46 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a narrow peak followed by a broad peak with a tail.
The duration (T90) is about 2.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.06 s to T0+1.41 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 2427 +/- 580 keV,
Alpha =-1.49 +/- 0.01 and Beta = -1.74 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.16 +/- 0.08)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.64 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 121 +/- 3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
