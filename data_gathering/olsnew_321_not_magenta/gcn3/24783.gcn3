Using the data set from T-240 to T+35 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190610A (trigger #907754)
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 24775).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 46.244, -7.661 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 04m 58.6s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 39' 38.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a short spike that starts ~T+0.2, peaks
at ~T+0.3, and ends ~T+0.9. Due to the SAA, data beyond ~T+35 s are
unavailable.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.62 +- 0.11 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.21 to T+0.89 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.32 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.1 +- 0.5 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.9 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
