We observed the position of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075)
at 15 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on 
2014 Nov 24.17 to 24.33 UT, corresponding to 3 days post-burst. We 
have detected a radio source coincident with the optical counterpart 
(Tanga et al., GCN 17078) with a preliminary flux of 0.46 +/- 0.05 mJy.

Earlier observations were conducted on 2014 Nov 21.16 to 21.25 UT and 
Nov 22.05 to 22.21 UT, corresponding to <6 minutes and 0.9 days post-burst,
yielding a 3 sigma flux upper limit of 0.26 mJy and a marginal detection of 
0.18 +/- 0.06 mJy, respectively.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
