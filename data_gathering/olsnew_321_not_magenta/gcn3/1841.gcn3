K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Mereghetti, J. Borkowski, and D. Gotz, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
IBIS GRB team, report:

Ulysses observed this burst (GCN 1836, 1838).  As observed by Ulysses,
it had a duration of approximately 100 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
1.E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 0.25 s of approximately 6.E-07 erg/cm2 s.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl. (2000)=
176.751,+40.439 degrees, with radius 22.616 +/- 0.032 degrees (3 sigma).
This annulus intersects the error circle given in GCN 1838 at:

          RA       DEC
     202.037      30.699
     202.079      30.757
     201.944      30.693
     202.046      30.832

reducing its area by a factor of about 5, to 16 sq. arcmin.

This localization may be improved.
