report on behalf of the GRACE collaboration:


The 130 arcsec radius error circle of the HETE burst GRB 020819 (HETE
trigger #2275, Seq_4; Vanderspek et al. GCN #1508) was imaged in the
K' band on August 19/20, 23:12 UT - 0:33 UT (about 9 hrs after the
burst), using the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope equipped  with the Omega
Prime near-infrared camera (1k x 1k; FOV 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin). The
integration time was 63 min. The limiting magnitude is about K'=20
(+/-0.5), the seeing was about 1.5 arcsec.

Based  on a visual comparison with the corresponding DSS2 red image we 
find a best afterglow candidate at coordinates  

        RA, DEC (J2000) = 23:27:31.5, 6:14:59,  +/- 1 arcsec.

This source is relatively bright in K' (we can only provide a very
rough estimate at the moment; K' = 17.5 +/- 1) but has no counterpart on
the DSS 2 red image. We stress that we cannot yet rule out that this a
red foreground star. Naturally, there are several more, progressively
fainter, objects that are also potential candidates. 

Further NIR observations are needed in order to search for a fading 
behaviour.
