Following the possible detection reported in GCN12558 we again
observed GRB111107A (GCN12534) with the Australian Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) on Nov 14 from 16:54UT to 18:43UT (~7.5 days after the
GRB trigger). We detect no emission from the GRB with a 3sigma limit
of 180 uJy and 150 uJy at 5.5GHz and 9 GHz respectively. Given that
the 5.5 GHz radio luminosity of the GRB is expected to increase over
at least the first 7.5 days post burst, we conclude that the possible
4sigma detection reported in GCN12558 is a result of the nearby source
SUMSS J083735-663107. No further observations are planned. We thank
the observatory staff for scheduling and supporting these
observations.
