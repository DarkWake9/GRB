Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of SWIFT J174540.2-290037 (trigger# 690197;
Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 19515).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 266.376, -28.978 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  17h 45m 30.2s
    Dec(J2000) = -28d 58' 39.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.

The source was in the field of view from T-70 sec to T+640 and was at a
fairly steady rate during this time period.

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.00 to T+384.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. 
  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
