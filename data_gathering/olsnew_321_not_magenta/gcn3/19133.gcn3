J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P. Wozniak, and H. Davis
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR network of robotic optical telescopes made observations of Swift
trigger 677495 (Beardmore, et al., GCN 19126).  The burst location was within
the field of our wide-field monitor located in Maui, HI, which began a 10 s
integration of the location beginning at 10:54:38.19 UT, 3.86 s before the
Swift trigger time and during the gamma-ray emitting interval.  We do not
detect an optical counterpart to a limiting magnitude of 10.5.  Our 3-sigma
limiting magnitudes are based on a comparison of our unfiltered image to the
Tycho-2 V-band catalog.
