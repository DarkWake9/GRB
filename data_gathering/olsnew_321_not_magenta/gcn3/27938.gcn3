SUBJECT: GRB 200613A: OAJ Afterglow: Error in Coordinates

D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC) corrects:

The source reported in Kann et al., GCN #27935, lies at coordinates:

RA (J2000) = 10:12:10.08
Dec. (J2000) = 45:45:14.26

and is therefore coincident with the XRT afterglow (Kennea et al., GCN 
#27936) and the source detected earlier by Pozanenko et al. (GCN #27937) 
as well as the potential host galaxy also mentioned by the latter GCN 
(coordinates in GCN #27935 suffer the same error).

I'm sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused.
