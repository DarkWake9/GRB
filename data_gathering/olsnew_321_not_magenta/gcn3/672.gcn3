K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB Team, S. Barthelmy, on behalf
of the GCN GRB team, F. Frontera, C. Guidorzi and E. Montanari, on
behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the NEAR
GRB team, report:

Ulysses, BATSE, the BeppoSAX GRBM, and NEAR observed this burst at
29885 s UT.  (BATSE Trigger #8111).  As observed by Ulysses, it
had a duration ~15 s, and a 25-100 keV fluence 3x10^-6 erg/cm^2.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary 100 sq. arcmin. error
box whose 3 sigma coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 23 h  4 m 38.55 s      1 o 10 '  16.67 "  (CENTER)
 23 h  5 m  9.33 s      1 o 12 '  58.16 "  (CORNER)
 23 h  4 m 25.46 s      1 o  2 '  54.25 "  (CORNER)
 23 h  4 m 51.59 s      1 o 17 '  39.60 "  (CORNER)
 23 h  4 m  7.73 s      1 o  7 '  35.67 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined.
