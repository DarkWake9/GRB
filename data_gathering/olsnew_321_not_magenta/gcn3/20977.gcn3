The short GRB 170403A (Fermi-GBM observation: Roberts & Meegan,
GCN 20975; IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN 20976) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=50358.544 s UT (13:59:18.544).

The light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~0.12s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(5.4 ± 0.8)x10^-7 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0-0.016, of (7.6 ± 1.8)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated 3-channel spectrum of the burst, measured from
T0-0.064 s to T0+0.064 s, can be modeled by an exponentially cutoff 
power law with alpha = -0.16 (-0.36, +0.46) and Ep = 357(-58,+90) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
