At 16:26:10 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 100526A (trigger=423181).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 230.785, +25.639 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 23m 08s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 38' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, there is
no obvious variation in the immediately-available lightcurve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 16:28:36.0 UT, 145.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 230.7684, +25.6310 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 15h 23m 04.41s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 37' 51.6"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 61 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 2.71e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 151 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.04. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is L. Vetere (vetere AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
