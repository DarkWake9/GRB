reports on behalf of the Xinglong GRB follow-up team report:

 "We observed the optical counterpart of the GRB 20060218
(Cusumano et al. (GCN 4775)) with the 0.8m and the 1m telescopes
at Xinglong Observatory, National Astronomical Observatories,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. We began  observations in R band
7.1953 hours after the trigger.  Preliminary analyses show the
object has a R magnitude of  17.79  0.1 on Feb 18.4522 UT
and 18.25  0.1 on Feb 20.4471 UT (reference stars from
USNO-A2.0), which is brighter than the pre-burst counterpart
observed by SDSS(GCN 4777). Further analysis is under processing."
