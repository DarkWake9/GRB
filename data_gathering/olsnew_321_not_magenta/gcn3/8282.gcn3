  At 2008-09-22 14:54UT Swift performed a TOO observation of the INTEGRAL
burst GRB 080922 (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 8281), 3h52m after the
INTEGRAL trigger.

   No X-ray source was found in or near the IBAS error circle in a 5.9ks
exposure Swift/XRT Photon Counting mode image down to a 3 sigma limiting 0.3-10keV count
rate of 4.3e-3 count/s. Assuming a power-law spectrum of photon index 2
absorbed by the Galactic column density of 1.14e22 cm-2 in the direction
of the burst, this corresponds to an observed 0.3-10keV flux limit of
2.55e-13 erg cm-2 s-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
