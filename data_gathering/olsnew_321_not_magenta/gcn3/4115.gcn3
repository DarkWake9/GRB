S. Barthelmy (GSFC) and T. Sakamoto (GSFC)
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=160619) at 12:12:33 UT on 21 Oct 2005
is not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source.  Using the full
event-by-event data from the recent telemetry downlink, all 70 events
in the trigger occurred within a single 100 microsec timestamp sampling
of the individual events.  This trigger was due to a cosmic shower event in BAT.
