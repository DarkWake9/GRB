D. Malesani (DARK), K. Horne, and N. Kains (SUPA, St. Andrews), report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the location of the candidate optical transient reported by 
Klotz et al. (GCN 6769) with the Danish telescope located at the La 
Silla observatory. Observations were carried out in the R band for a 
total of 30 min exposure, with mean time Sep 1.0489 UT. The seeing was 1.2".

Consistent with the reports of other observers (Berger et al., GCN 6770; 
Fruchter et al., GCN 6772), at the location of the TAROT object we 
detect no sources down to R~23 (calibrated against USNO-B1).
