We observed the field of GRB 140320A (Cannizzo, et al., GCN 16000) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/03 21.42 to 2014/03 21.51
UTC (31.77 to 33.94 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
1.40 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.56 hours exposure in the
Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with 2MASS,
we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 22.70
  i     > 22.38
  Z     > 21.23
  Y     > 21.27
  J     > 20.82
  H     > 20.24

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
