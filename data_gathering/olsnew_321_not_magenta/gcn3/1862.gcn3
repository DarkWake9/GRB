K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind
and Helicon-Coronas-F GRB teams, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Helicon, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 28326 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 24 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  9.4E-07 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  3.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 354.375, -41.120 degrees, whose radius is 28.095 +/- 0.422
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be improved, but as the event was not observed by Mars
Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
