R. Chornock (Ohio University) and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We have been obtaining a sequence of near-infrared spectroscopy (range 1-1.8 
microns) of the optical counterpart (SSS17a: Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et 
al., GCN 21530) of LIGO/Virgo G298048 (GCNs 21509, 21513) using FLAMINGOS2 on 
Gemini-South (PI: Chornock).

Our initial spectra, taken on 20170819 at 00:45 UT (~1.5 days after the 
LIGO/Virgo event) have a smooth blue continuum.  Data taken the following night 
show a few broad, low-amplitude features starting to develop.  An initial 
reduction of data taken on 20170821 at 23:40 UT (~4.5 days after the LIGO/Virgo 
event) shows that these features (including a possible spectral peak near 1.05 
microns) have strengthened.  Analysis is ongoing and further observations are 
planned to constrain the potential presence of lanthanide opacities in the 
near-infrared.

We thank the Gemini staff, particularly Hwihyun Kim, Gonzalo Diaz, Pablo Candia, 
and Laura Ferrarese for their support of these operations.
