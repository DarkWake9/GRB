P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov, D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf
of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The bright short-duration hard GRB 130603B
(Swift-BAT trigger 557310: Melandri, et al., GCN 14735;
Barthelmy et al., GCN 14741)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=56956.448s UT (15:49:16.448)

The light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
from ~T0-0.008 s to ~T0+0.082 s.
The total duration of the burst is ~0.090 s

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB130603_T56956/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (6.6 ± 0.7)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0,
of (1.0 ± 0.2)x10-4 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.128 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the cutoff power law with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.73 ± 0.15,
the peak energy Ep = 660 ± 100 keV,
chi2 = 67/69 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
