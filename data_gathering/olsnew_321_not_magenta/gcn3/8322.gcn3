SUBJECT: GRB 081001: Further observations from OSN

A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO, Santiago), F. Aceituno, M. Jelínek,
J. Gorosabel and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, Granada) on
behalf of a larger collaboration report,

We have observed again the field of GRB 081001 (Lazzarotto et
al., GCN 8305, Page et al., GCN 8307) from the 1.5m OSN
telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Granada (Spain). In a
combined 5x300s exposure in I-band we still detect the source
reported in our previous GCN (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN
8310) with no variation in brightness indicating that it is
probably unrelated with the GRB. No further source is detected
within the XRT error box. The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes of
the images obtained from OSN are I > 20.7  0.95 days after the
burst and I > 21.2 1.94 days after the burst.
