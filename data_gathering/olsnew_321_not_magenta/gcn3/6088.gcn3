report:

An extremely intense short, hard GRB triggered Konus-Wind
at 2007-02-01 T0=55390.780 s UT (15:23:10.780).
It also triggered INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS. Swift-BAT observed it at a very high 
background level while entering the SAA.
The burst was Earth-occulted to Suzaku and RHESSI,
and Mars-occulted to Odyssey. Ulysses was off.

This burst had the highest peak count rate of any cosmic
GRB observed by Konus-Wind in 12 years of operation (SGR
bursts excluded).

The burst light curve shows a main multipeaked pulse
with a duration of ~0.15 s, which was followed by a much weaker softer 
pulse with a duration of ~0.08 s.
The burst demonstrates strong spectral evolution.

It was triangulated to the Wind-INTEGRAL annulus
centered at RA=114.847 (07h 39m 23s)  Dec=+23.826 (+23d 49' 33"),
whose radius is 83.626 +/- 0.160 deg (3 sigma).
The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes +60 and +90 degrees.
Combined with the occultation data, this
constrains the arrival direction to that portion of the
annulus between RA, Dec = 13, +37 and 350, +62 degrees.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a fluence of ~2x10^-5 erg/cm2 
and a peak flux of ~1x10^-3 erg/cm2/s (both in the 20-2000 keV range).
Epeak of the time-integrated spectrum is ~300 keV.

Detailed spectral parameters will be reported later.
