"We have observed the XRT error region of GRB 060927 using Kiso 1.05m
Schmit telescope. The observation was started at 14:27 (about 20 min
after the burst). The optical afterglow is marginally detected in our
R band images taken with 90 sec exposure. The brightness in R band
derived by USNO-B1.0 catalog is 19.5 +/- 0.3. 

Further observations and analysis are progress."
