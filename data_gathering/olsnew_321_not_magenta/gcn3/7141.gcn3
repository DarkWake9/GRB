The bright, IPN localized GRB 071125 (Golenetskii et al., GCN 7136)
was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
 energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2007-11-25 13:56:42 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a double-peaked structure in 1-sec
time resolution. The T90 duration  was about 6.0 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 5.8 (+0.4, -0.3) X 10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+1s was  32.9 (+1.0, -1.3)
photons/cm^2/s in the same  energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-1s to
T0+12s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.

the low-energy photon index alpha: -1.0 (+0.4, -0.3),
the high-energy photon index beta: -3.1 (+0.3, -0.6),
the break energy E0:      326 (+100, -92)  keV,
and the peak energy Epeak: 330 (+20, -20) keV (chi^2/d.o.f = 21/22).


All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
A 3% systematic error was added to each energy channel due to the
brightness of this GRB.

The light curves with 1-sec time resolution for this burst will be appeared at:
