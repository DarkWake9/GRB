A. Corsi (TTU) and M.M. Kasliwal (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We analyzed the Karl G. Jansky VLA observation of the field of the possible optical counterpart 
SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN  21529) that started on 2017-Aug-19 22:01:48 UT (Corsi et al. LVC 
GCN 21613). At a central frequency of ~6 GHz, our preliminary analysis does not show any significant 
emission at the location of the optical candidate (RA= 13:09:48.089, Dec= -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 
LVC GCN 21529) down to a 3-sigma limit of ~22 uJy. We detect the host emission (RA = 13:09:47.704, 
Dec =-23:23:02.45; Alexander et al. LVC GCN 21589) at a flux level of ~0.3 mJy at 6 GHz.
