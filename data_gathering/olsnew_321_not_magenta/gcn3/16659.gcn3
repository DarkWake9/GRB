G. Masi, the Virtual Telescope Project - Italy, reports:

I observed the field of GRB 140801A (Fermi trigger 428612396) with with the 17" 
robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope (Ceccano, Italy) at 2 Aug. 2014, 
00:10:39 UT, 5.15 hours seconds after the burst.

An optical source is visible where described by Gorbovskoy et al. (GCN 16653) 
and D. Xu et al (GCN 16656) in a image coming from the sum of three, 180-seconds 
exposures, unfiltered. The position of the source is RA: 02 56 16.46 +30 56 17.9 
(J2000.0, mean residuals of 0.2") and the magnitude was estimated to be 19.6, 
assuming R mags for the reference stars from UCAC-4.
