The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:56:27 UT on 8 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190808A (trigger 586958192.790556 / 190808498).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 282.2, Dec = -31.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 48m, -31d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
