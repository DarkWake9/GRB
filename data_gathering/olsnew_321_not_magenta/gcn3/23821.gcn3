report on behalf of the GOTO collaboration:

The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) observed the
IPN region of GRB 190129B (Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 23808), between
 2019-01-29T21:07:31 and 2019-01-30T02:41:31 with several sets of 5x120s
exposures in our wide L filter (400-700nm).

No viable counterpart is detected within or near the 3-sigma error region
of Hurley et al. down to a 5-sigma detection limit of g=20.9. Our limits
are consistent with those reported in Lupinov et al. (GCN 23816) at around
the same delta since the burst.

We see no evidence for the source candidates reported by Bolmer et al.
(GCN 23814), Piranomonto et al. (GCN 23818) and Butler et al. (GCN 23820).


GOTO is operated at the La Palma observing facilities of the
University of Warwick on behalf of a consortium including the
University of Warwick, Monash University, Armagh Observatory, the
University of Leicester, the University of Sheffield, the National
Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT) and the Instituto
de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC) (https://goto-observatory.org/)
