G. Younes, C. Kouveliotou (GWU) report on behalf of the Fermi/GBM magnetar
team:

"SGR 1935+2154 has triggered FERMI/GBM twice in the past 24 hours on short
bright events. The times of the triggers are as follows:

Trigger number        Trigger date        Trigger time (UT)
bn160620637            2016-06-20        15:16:34.88(*)
bn160618852            2016-06-18        20:27:25.80

(*) GBM trigger simultaneous with MAXI/GSC detection (Negoro et al. 2016,
GCN 19545)

The source has been sporadically undergoing outbursts for the past two
years (see, e.g., Cummmings 2014 GCN 16530, Kaneko et al. 2014 GCN 16577,
Burrows et al. 2015 GCN 17485, Burns & Younes 2015 GCN 17496, Yu & Veres
2016 GCN 19434, Younes 2016 GCN 19437).

Detailed analysis of the FERMI GBM triggered and untriggered bursts
detected during all outburst episodes is underway and will be reported
elsewhere."
