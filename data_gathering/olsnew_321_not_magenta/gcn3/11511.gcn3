Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110102A (trigger #441454)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 11509).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 245.877, 7.617 deg, which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 23m 30.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 37' 00.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 66%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a pair of small precursor peaks starting
at ~T-50 sec and ending at ~T+50 sec.  The main emission occurs with four peaks
that start at ~T+100 sec and ending at ~T+340 with the maximum at ~T+210 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 264 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-49.2 to T+294.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.60 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.65 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+208.76 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 8.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
