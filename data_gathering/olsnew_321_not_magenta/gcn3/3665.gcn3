At 12:34:09 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB050724
(trigger=147478). The spacecraft slewed immediately. The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA,Dec 246.214, -27.524 {+16h 24m 51s, -27d 31'
25"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment,
stat+sys). The light curve appears to be short, with full-width half
maximum of less than 0.25 sec, and a peak rate of 10,000 ct/s in that
interval.

The XRT started the observation at 12:35:22.9  UT with XRT in automatic
state, 74 sec after the BAT Trigger. A rapidly fading, uncatalogued, X-
ray source was detected at the following position RA, Dec 16h 24m 44.9s,
-27d 32' 34.0" with an uncertainty of about 6 arcsec (90% containment).
This is 1.78 arcmin from the BAT position reported above.
