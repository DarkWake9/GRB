The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:45:11 UT on 8 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190708A (trigger 584268316.798502 / 190708365).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 209.9, Dec = -1.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 59m, -1d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
