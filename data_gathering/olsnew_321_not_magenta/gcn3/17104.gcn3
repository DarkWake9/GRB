FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 141121A afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at November 26 22.54 UT to
November 27 09.34 UT, i.e. 5.78 - 6.23 days after the burst (GCN 17075).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 0.17 +/- 0.04 mJy
at the position of the optical counterpart (GCN 17078).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining
these observations."
