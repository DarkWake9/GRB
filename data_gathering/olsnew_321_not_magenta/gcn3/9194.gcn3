SUBJECT: GRB 090422: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    09/04/22 16:44:16 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 6291 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 8 UVOT
images for GRB 090422, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 294.74967, +40.38445 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 19h 38m 59.92s
Dec (J2000): +40d 23' 04.0"

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, arXiv:0812.3662).
