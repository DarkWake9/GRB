The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are switched off around the perigee passage, every 2.6
days, to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time
of the LIGO/Virgo trigger G298936 (2017-08-23 13:13:58 UTC) the
spacecraft was preparing to the start the observations after the
perigee passage between the orbits number 1853 and 1854 and no
scientific instrument data are available before
2017-08-23T13:34:33.565 (~20 minutes after the event).
