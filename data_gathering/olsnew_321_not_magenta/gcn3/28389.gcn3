The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:57:28 UT on 7 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200907C (trigger 621212253.091068 / 200907957).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 34.5, Dec = -78.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 17m, -78d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 24.0 degrees.
