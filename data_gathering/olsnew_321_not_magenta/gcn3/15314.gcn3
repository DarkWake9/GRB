B. A. Zauderer, E. Berger, W. Fong (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration and the CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient
Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 131004A (Hagen et al., GCN 15303) with
CARMA at a mean frequency of 93 GHz beginning 2013 October 5.04 (dt=3.4
hours).  We do not find significant radio emission at the position of the
enhanced Swift-XRT and UVOT localizations (Evans et al., GCN 15308; De
Pasquale et al., GCN 15313), or the optical afterglow detection (Xu et al.,
GCN 15304), to a 3-sigma upper limit of ~0.3 mJy.  No further radio
observations are planned.

We thank the CARMA staff for prompt execution of these observations."
