Using the data set from T-239 to T+603 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of the trigger #650140 on IGR J00291+5934
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 18051).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 7.221, 59.546 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 28m 53.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +59d 32' 44.3" 
with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 70%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows constant low-level emission (0.03 cnts/cm2/sec
in the 15-350 keV band)) starting at ~T-118, when the source location came
into the BAT FoV during a pre-planned slew, out to at least T+603 sec
when we no long have data.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0 to T+603 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.01 +- 0.32.  The fluence (over this window of data) in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
