report:

   We observed the error box of GRB 040924 (Fenimore et al., GCN 2735) with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey). We made a set of 300s exposures in R, starting at 20:50 UT,
i.e. approximately 9 hours after the burst. Near the position of the OT
given by Fox and Moon (GCN 2734) we detected a faint object, m_R=~22.1.
Its coordinates:

02:06:22.56  +16:06:48.4 (2000.0)

Astrometry was done using UCAC2 catalog, the accuracy is 0.1 arcsec.

   The object seems to be extended, therefore the host galaxy may contribute
a significant fraction of the flux of this source. We will continue
our observations in order to detect its possible fading behavior.
