E. Rol (U of Leicester), P. Jakobsson (U of Hertfordshire), N. Tanvir
(U of Leicester), A. Levan (U of Hertfordshire), report for a larger
collaboration:

We obtained a spectrum of GRB 060908 (Evans et al, GCN 5544) with 
Gemini-North/GMOS, for a total of 30 minutes starting approximately 2 
hours post burst. We identify absorption lines of CIV (1548, 1551) and
SiII (1304), and possibly AlIII (1863), at a redshift of z = 2.43 +/- 0.05.

We thank the Gemini staff for their support with the observations.
