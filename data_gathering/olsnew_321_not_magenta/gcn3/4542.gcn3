S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The long soft GRB 060117 (Swift-BAT trigger #177666;
Campana et al., GCN 4533; Cummings et al., GCN 4538)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=24597.852 s UT (06:49:57.852).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows multiple peaks with a total duration of 
~20 sec.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had
a fluence of (2.97+/-0.13)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and
peak flux measured from T+11.12 on 16 msec time scale
(1.28+/-0.18)x10^-5 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB (from T0 to T0+21.504 sec)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.519 (-0.070,+0.082),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.91(-0.50, +0.25),
the break energy E0 = 184(-30, +34) keV (chi2 = 53/59 dof).
The peak energy Ep = 89+/-5 keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
