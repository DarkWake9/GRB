and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160508A (INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7459; Konus-Wind trigger time on
14:32:38.795 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 14:32:31.73 on
8 May 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single spike starting at T0, peaking at T0+6 sec,
and ending at T0+35 sec.  A hint of the emission is seen up to T0+~150 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 20.0 +- 1.6 sec (40-450 keV).

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center
located at the Waseda University.
