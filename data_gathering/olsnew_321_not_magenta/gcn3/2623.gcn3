 Observatory) report:

On June 24, we have observed the field of GRB040624 (Mereghetti et al.,
 GCN 2613) in Rc filter with the 152 cm telescope of Bologna University.
 Observing in poor sky conditions we have obtained 8 images from
 UT = 24.84502 to UT = 24.88096 with 300s exposition time.
 By visual comparison of individual and coadded images with the USNO B
 catalog we did not find any new objects.
 We estimate that our coadded images (at mean UT = 24.86299) attained a
 magnitude limit of Rc = 20.5.
