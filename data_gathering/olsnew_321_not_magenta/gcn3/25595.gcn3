We obtained a spectrum of the optical afterglow (GCN #25555, #25558,
#25560) of GRB190829A (GCN #25551, #25552) with the Low Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995) on the Keck I telescope.
Observations began at UT 2019-08-31 03:35 for a total exposure time of
20 minutes. The afterglow is clearly detected in the data, and
exhibits a featureless red continuum. Narrow galaxy emission lines of
H alpha and [S II]  are detected at a redshift of z = 0.078,
consistent with the redshift of the underlying galaxy. The red
continuum and host emission features are consistent with those
reported in GCN #25563 and #25565.
