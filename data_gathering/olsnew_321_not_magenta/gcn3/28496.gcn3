The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:38:02 UT on 25 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200925A (trigger 622737487.659784 / 200925610).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 94.8, Dec = 32.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 19m, 32d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 120.0 degrees.
