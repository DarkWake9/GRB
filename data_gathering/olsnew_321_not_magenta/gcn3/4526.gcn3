On Jan 16, 2005 the field of GRB 060115 (Tagliaferri et al. GCN 4509) was
observed with the REM telescope located in La Silla (Chile).

The field was imaged with the ROSS optical spectrograph/imager and with
the REMIR near infrared camera in the R and H filters, respectively,
starting at 0:50 UT (approximately 11 hours after the burst) for a total
integration time of 1200 and 800 s, respectively.

No sources are detected within the SWIFT-XRT error circle down to
limiting magnitudes R = 17.7 and H = 15.1 (3-sigma upper limits).
