C. MacLeod, M. Nysewander report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:


We have observed the position of the GRB 050820a afterglow reported by Fox
et al. (GCN 3829).  We detect the afterglow in RcIc:

Mean Time      Integration    Filter  Magnitude       Telescope
Since GRB      Time

2.2 hr         39 x 40 sec    Ic      17.40 +/- .08   PROMPT-3
2.2 hr         22 x 30 sec    Rc      17.64 +/- .09   PROMPT-5
21.5 hr        136 x 40 sec   Ic      18.42 +/- .11   PROMPT-3
21.7 hr        179 x 30 sec   Rc      20.06 +/- .31   PROMPT-5

Rc and Ic calibrations were made relative to 7 calibration stars posted by
Henden (GCN 3845).

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
