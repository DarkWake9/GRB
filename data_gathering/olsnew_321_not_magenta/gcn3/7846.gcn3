W. Rujopakarn (Steward), E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
080607 (Swift trigger 313417). The first image was at 06:07:49.0 UT, 22.0
s after the burst (6.0 s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images
are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 14.8 magnitude, fading
source with coordinates:

     12:59:47.3      +15:55:10.8    (J2000), with positional uncertainty
of 1" or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker
database.

marked 11 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
