TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GCN/INTEGRAL Mistake Fixed

As some of you already know, GCN is now actually distributing INTEGRAL Notices.
Last night I found and fixed a mistake I made in the GCN program
which was blocking the actual distribution of the INTEGRAL Notices.

I am extremely sorry for this mistake and apologize for costing you
opportunitites in follow-ups on the two INTEGRAL Alerts.

The mistake happened because I omitted a commandline argument
to the GCN program.  This argument was used during the testing phase
of the INTEGRAL Notices back in Aug-Sept.  Now during actual INTEGRAL
operations, its omission was preventing the actual distribution.  I have been
checking the logfiles and have seen the many INTEGRAL messages (nearly all
test messages) arrive from the INTERGAL Operations computer, get unpacked,
and reformated into GCN standard format, so I assumed that all was
working well.  But I neglected to check for the very last step in that
sequence -- the distribution action.  I have fixed the GCN program
so this mistake (the missing commandline argument) can NOT happen again.
There is no final "debugging" filtering of INTEGRAL Notices any more.
Now the filtering of INTEGRAL Notices will be based ONLY on the filter options
you have requested in your individual site configurations.

My sincere apologies for this mistake.  I will redouble my efforts
to restore your confidence in the GCN system.

Sincerely,
Scott Barthelmy
