L. Rhodes, R. Fender (Oxford), J. Bray and D.R.A. Williams (JBCA) report:


e-MERLIN observed the position of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 28632) at 1.5GHz at 19 and 23 days post burst. Both epochs show a point source with coordinates consistent with those from the VLA detection (Fong et al., GCN Circ. 28688). The flux densities of the detections are 214+/-25uJy and 256+/-27uJy for epochs 1 and 2, respectively. We tentatively attribute the observed emission to the GRB’s host galaxy as there is very little variation in the flux density between our two epochs. There is also no significant variation between our detections and that from Fong et al., when using an optically thin spectrum to scale between the two observing bands.


We are in the process of obtaining further radio observations.


We thank the e-MERLIN staff for the time allocation and their assistance with the observations.
