The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:10:42 UT on 11 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200811A (trigger 618851447 / 200811632).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 120.2, Dec = -4.80 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 8h 1m, -4d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
