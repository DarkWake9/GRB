on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), RHESSI, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and
Konus-Wind observed this GRB at 49707 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses,
it had a duration of approximately  40 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately 1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
8.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 141 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   7 h 59 m 33.01 s    -48 o 35 '  15.19 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  8 h 03 m 03.68 s    -48 o 50 '  00.47 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  7 h 59 m 16.48 s    -48 o 36 '  06.80 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  7 h 59 m 49.52 s    -48 o 34 '  23.40 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  7 h 56 m 02.48 s    -48 o 19 '  58.08 " 

This error box may be improved.
