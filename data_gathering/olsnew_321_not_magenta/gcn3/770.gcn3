K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 70782 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~80 s, a 25-100 keV
fluence of ~2x10^-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.25 s of
~6.5x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary,
3 sigma error box whose area is ~100 sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 18 h  8 m 43.68 s     45 o 50 '  47.28 "  (CENTER)
 18 h  8 m 28.29 s     45 o 53 '  43.56 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  8 m 37.97 s     45 o 32 '  25.73 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  8 m 50.13 s     46 o  9 '   8.88 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  8 m 59.07 s     45 o 47 '  51.20 "  (CORNER)
