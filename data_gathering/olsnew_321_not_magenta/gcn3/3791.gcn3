TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3791
SUBJECT: GRB050813: SWIFT/UVOT observation

A. J. Blustin (UCL-MSSL), A. Retter (PSU), M. J. Page (UCL-MSSL),

the Swift UVOT team

Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB050813 at 06:46:52.0 UT,
102 s after the BAT trigger (Retter et al., GCN 3788). We detect no
new source with respect to the DSS within the XRT error circle
(Morris et al., GCN 3790) down to the following 3-sigma upper
limits:

Filter   T_range (s)   Exp (s)  3sig UL (mag)

V        103-963       188      19.1

B        249-1200      188      20.2

U        235-1096      188      19.9

UVW1     221-991       98       19.7

UVM2     207-977       98       19.3

UVW2     264-1305      188      20.6

Where T_range is the time in seconds since the BAT trigger.

There is a known star at the edge of the XRT error circle at the
J2000 coordinates 16:07:57.41 +11:14:42.9 with a V magnitude of
15.9 measured by the UVOT.

These magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
