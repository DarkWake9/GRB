TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 36711 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 75 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.5E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 167.858,  18.462 degrees, whose radius is 27.625 +/-  0.643
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
