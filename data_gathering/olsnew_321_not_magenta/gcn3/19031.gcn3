A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:34:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible source near IGR17488-3253 (trigger=674752). 
Swift will not slew to the source as the ongoing observations of
GRB 160220B have a higher priority. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 267.196, -32.939 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 48m 47s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 56' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, there is nothing
significant in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

We note that this is a low significance trigger (5.9 sigma), part of
the sub-threshold program within BAT. Given that we lack XRT data, we
cannot at present confirm that the source is real. We will have to
wait until the full BAT dataset is transferred to ground to establish
the reality of this trigger.
