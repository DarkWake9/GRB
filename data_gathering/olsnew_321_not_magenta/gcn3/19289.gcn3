O.J. Roberts (UCD), C.M. Hui (NASA/MSFC) report on
behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:28:52.52 UT on the 11th of April 2016, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 160411A
(trigger 482030936 / 160411062), which was also detected by
Swift (Page et al. 2016, GCN 19279). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time using the Swift XRT position is about 108 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a weak, short burst with a
duration (T90) of about 0.2 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-0.51 s to T0-0.35 s is best fit by a power
law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff function,
with Epeak = 161 +/- 37 keV and alpha = 0.26 +/- 0.67.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.38 +/- 0.30)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64ms peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.51 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.4 +/- 1.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
