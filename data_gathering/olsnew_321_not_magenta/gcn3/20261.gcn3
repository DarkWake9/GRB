F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 161214B
295 s after the BAT trigger (D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ. 20257).
A single source is detected within the enhanced XRT error region
(Evans, GCN Circ. 20259) in the initial UVOT exposures.
The source position is consistent with that of SDSS J001524.26+072108.5
and also with that of an entry in the USNO-B1.0 catalog.
Since the two UVOT exposures were taken with different filters, it is 
not yet possible to report on variability.
It is possible that some of the flux is due to an optical afterglow 
(as suggested for NOT observations by Malesani et al. GCN Circ. 20260).
Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposures are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)         Mag

u_FC               295          545          246         18.4 +/- 0.2
white_FC           872          955           82         18.1 +/- 0.2

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.08 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
