Further analysis of the data reported in GCN 9202 reveals that the
source did not fade appreciably (i.e. by more than ~0.15 mag) between
observations with mid-times 25 and 41 minutes post-burst.  However, we
do believe that the extension of the image is consistent with it
being a point source.

We note that the revised XRT error circle (GCN 9205) now contains this
source, making it likely the counterpart or host of this GRB.
