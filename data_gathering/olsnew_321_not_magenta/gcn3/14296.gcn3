Using the data set from T-60 to T+180 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130313A (trigger #550906)
(Gompertz, et al., GCN Circ. 14293).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 236.438, -0.355 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 45m 45.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 21' 18.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 82%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single pulse starting at ~T+0.0,
peaking at ~T+0.1 sec, and ending at ~T+0.2 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
0.26 +- 0.09 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.02 to T+0.23 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.37 +- 0.36.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.7 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.36 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
