The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:16:27 UT on 15 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190615A (trigger 582304592.372344 / 190615636).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 191.4, Dec = 49.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 45m, 49d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 122.0 degrees.
