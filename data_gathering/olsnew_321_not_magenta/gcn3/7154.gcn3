E. Berger (Princeton), N. Morrell and M. Roth (LCO) report:

"We obtained three 900-s spectra of the candidate host galaxy of GRB 
071227 (GCNs 7150,7151) with IMACS on the Magellan/Baade telescope.  We 
find the same emission line noted by D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 7152), as well 
as a second emission line which corresponds to [OIII]5006 at the same 
redshift.  From preliminary wavelength calibration we find z=0.384.  If 
this is the host galaxy of GRB 071227, the observed fluence of 2.2e-7 
erg/cm^2 (GCN 7148) translates to an isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy 
of 8e49 erg, typical of previous short GRBs."
