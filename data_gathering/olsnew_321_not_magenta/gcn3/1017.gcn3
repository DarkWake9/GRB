P.A. Price, T.S. Axelrod, B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU), D.E. Reichart, J.S.
Bloom and D. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger international GRB
collaboration:

"We have observed the error-circle of the HETE-2 GRB 010324 with the
robotic 50-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory starting at 2001
Mar 26.45 UT (7.5 hours after the GRB). Our 5x300 sec images cover the
entire error box, and go fainter than the DSS-2 red plates.  From a 
preliminary visual comparison of our images with the DSS-2 plates, we do
not detect any obvious bright optical counterpart.

Further observations are planned."
