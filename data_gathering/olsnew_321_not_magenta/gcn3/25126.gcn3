K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

GCN Circ. 25125 was missing the details of the fit to the XRT light-curve.
The correct information is as follows:

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=2.11 (+/-0.05), followed by a break at T+387 s to an
alpha of 3.7 (+1.0, -0.4). A second break occurs at T+967 s to an alpha of
0.33 (+0.06, -0.09).

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.33, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.14 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 6.3 x
10^-12 (7.0 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We apologise for the omission of these numbers in the earlier circular.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
