We observed the field of GRB 170705A (Starling et al., GCN Circ. 21289) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/07 6.17 to 2017/07 6.26 UTC (25.33
to 27.52 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.02 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.37 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections:

 r	= 20.62 +/- 0.05
 i	= 20.35 +/- 0.05
 Z	= 19.68 +/- 0.07
 Y	= 19.72 +/- 0.09
 J	= 19.46 +/- 0.10
 H	= 19.61 +/- 0.16

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source has faded on average by 1.90 +/- 0.17 magnitudes compared to our previous observations (Butler et al., GCN Circ. 21293). This corresponds to a temporal index of -0.72 +/- 0.03, which is steeper than the index of -0.4 we saw during our previous observations.

Mártir.
