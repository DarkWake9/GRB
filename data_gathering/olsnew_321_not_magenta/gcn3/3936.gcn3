TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3936
SUBJECT: GRB 050906: MARGE Optical Limits
DATE:    05/09/06 23:42:46 GMT
FROM:    Heather Swan at U.of Michigan/ROTSE  <hflewell@umich.edu>

Heather F. Swan (U Mich), and Ian Smith (Rice), report on behalf of
the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC), attached to the AEOS telescope, located at
the Maui Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, responded to GRB 050906
(Swift trigger 153866), producing images between 10:47 and 10:59 UT,
starting 15 minutes after Swift-BAT triggered and located this burst.
These are 1s and 10s optical images were taken with a low resolution
grating.  With the revised BAT coordinates (GCN 3935), the ABC FoV
covers roughly 1/2 of the BAT error box, including IC 328.  Comparison of the 10
second images (which start at 10:55 UT) to the DSS (second epoch) reveals 
no new sources to a limiting magnitude of 19. Further analysis of these
images is in progress.
