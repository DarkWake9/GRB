A. C. Updike and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report on behalf of 
the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We observed the field of GRB 070529 (GCN 6466, Holland et al.) with the 
0.9m SARA telescope at KPNO.  Under decent weather conditions, we imaged 
the field from 06:14:58 UT, 17 hours and 26 minutes after the burst, 
until 07:52:12 UT.  We obtained a total of 50 min of R-band exposures.  
In the stacked image at the location of the afterglow identified in UVOT 
observations (GCN 6466), we detect no new object to a limiting magnitude 
of R = 19.0 +/- 0.2.
