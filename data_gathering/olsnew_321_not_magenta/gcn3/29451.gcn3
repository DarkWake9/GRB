GIT team:

We observed GRB 210208A detected by INTEGRAL (S. Mereghetti et. al., GCN
#29429) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We obtained four exposures
of 300-sec each in the r' filter. We did not detect any new source in our
stacked image within the 2 arcmin circle around R.A.= 260.1976 deg, DEC.=
-12.6667 deg. The obtained upper limit follows as:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (mid) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Exposure | Filter | Lim_mag (5-sigma) |

-----------------------------------------------------------------

 2459254.51368 | 10.78 | 300*4 (stacked) | r' | > 21.1 |

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS (Flewelling et al., 2018)
and not corrected for galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
