report on behalf of the Kanazawa GRB team:

We have imaged the field of GRB 080810 (Page et al. GCN 8080)
in R-band with 0.4m telescope at Kanazawa Japan.
We obtained the first image at one and half hours after 
the Swift trigger. We confirmed the bright optical counter 
part reported by Page et al. (GCN 8080), Ikejiri et al. (GCN 8081), 
and so on. Compared with the USNO-A2.0 catalog, the source 
magnitude is determined about 16.5 +/- 0.2 mag with 30 seconds 
exposure time from the begining of this observation.
Further analysis is in progress.
