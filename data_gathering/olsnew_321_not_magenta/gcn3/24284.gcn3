We report wide-field near-infrared follow-up observations of the
localization region of the gravitational wave event S190426c (GCN
#24237) by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey (Moore and Kasliwal 2019).
Gattini-IR is a newly commissioned near-IR camera with a field of view
of 25 square degrees mounted on a robotic 30 cm telescope at Palomar
observatory.

We started customized Target of Opportunity observations at UT
2019-04-27 03:31. The tiling was optimally determined and triggered
using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a,
Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We imaged a total of 2200 square degrees,
covering 92% of the probability region of the event for 1 to 4 epochs
until UT 2019-04-27 13:21. Each field visit consisted of a sequence of
8 dithers of 8 second exposures each on the field, which were
processed and stacked with the Palomar Gattini-IR data reduction
pipeline (De et al., in prep.). The typical limiting magnitude of each
stacked epoch (64 second exposure time) was between 14.5 and 15 AB mag
in J-band, and shallower than usual due to poor weather conditions.
Transient vetting is ongoing and any viable counterparts will be
announced.
