E. Berger (Harvard), D. B. Fox, A. Cucchiara (Penn State), and S. B. Cenko 
(UC Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Starting on 2008 October 7.276 UT (73 min after the burst) we observed 
the optical counterpart of GRB 081007 (GCN 8330) using GMOS on the 
Gemini-South 8-m telescope.  Two 900-sec exposures were obtained covering 
a wavlength range of 4600-7400A.  We identify two absorption features at 
6016.7 and 6070.3 A, as well as a weak emission line at 5700.9 A, which 
correspond to the CaII H&K and [OII]3727 lines at a redshift of 
z=0.5295+/-0.0001."
