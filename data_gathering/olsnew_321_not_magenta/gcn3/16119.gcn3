WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift trigger 596426. A bright
(R~13.5) optical counterpart un-cataloged in DSS image was detected
at location of Ra, DEC (J2000):

08:27:57.56
+46:14:25.11

with uncertainty of about 1". We suggest this to be the afterglow of
the GRB. Follow-up observations encouraged.
