K. Torii (Osaka University) reports:

 The entire error region of GRB 041218 (Mereghetti, et al., GCN 2858)
was observed with the 14-inch Automated Response Telescope at Osaka
University in Toyonaka. The observation started at 2004 December 18
15:47:34 UT while the early data suffered from cloud passages.

 In a stacked image (60-s x 4 frames obtained between 15:58 UT and
16:09 UT), we do not identify a new object brighter than about 16.0
mag (USNO-A2.0 R). On the other hand, we note a low S/N
afterglow candidate (R~16.5) at position
(R.A., Dec.) = (01 39 7.6, +71 20 30) (J2000) (1.5" uncertainty)
in the preliminary analysis.
