We observed the field of GRB 200216B (D'Avanzo et al. GCN circ. 27102) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories. The observation began at UT 13:46:56, 16th, Feb, 2020, about 14 min after the trigger. We did not detect any optical source in the Swift-XRT error circle. A preliminary measurement provided an upper limit of R~21.8.
