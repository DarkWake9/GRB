At 21:05:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050219b.  Because of the Earth-limb constraint,
the spacecraft could not immediately slew to the burst location.
The location became unconstrained at T+50 min, and the spacecraft slewed.
The XRT and UVOT instruments then began their standard set of pre-programmed
observing sequences.

Using the time interval of the burst, the ground-calculated location
is RA,Dec 81.287,-57.770 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 54 degrees off the BAT boresight (10% encoding).

The burst lightcurve has five overlapping peaks preceeded by a slow rise,
with a T90 duration of ~27 sec (and T50 is 6.8 sec).  The peak flux
is 26 ph/cm2/sec for a 1-sec interval (15-350 keV).  Using a simple power law
model, the fluence is ~2.3 (+/-30%) e-5 erg/cm^2 (15-350 keV).
