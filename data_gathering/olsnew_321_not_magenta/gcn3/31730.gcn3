The long GRB 220310A detected by MAXI/GSC (Negoro et al., GCN Circ. 31725)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:27:58.325 UTC
on 10 March 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1330907255/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T+0.5 sec, peaks at T+33.6 sec,and ends at T+47.0 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 33.1 +- 8.3 sec
and 12.9 +- 1.2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
