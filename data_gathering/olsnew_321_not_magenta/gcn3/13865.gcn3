Brajesh Kumar, Vijay Kumar Bhatt, Archana Soam and S.B. Pandey (ARIES,
Nainital, India, on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).


Follow-up observations of GRB 121011A (Racusin et al., GCN13845) were done
using 1.04m telescope at Nainital in good sky conditions starting at
13:17:03 (UT) on 11-10-2012. Several frames in B, V, R_c and I_c pass-bands
were obtained with exposure time of 300 sec each.

The optical afterglow candidate (Racusin et al., GCNC 13845) is clearly
detected in our frames. The preliminary photometry for the first R_c and
I_c frames were 19.59 +- 0.02 mag and 19.14 +- 0.05 mag respectively,
calibrated against nearby USNO stars. Further observations are continued.
