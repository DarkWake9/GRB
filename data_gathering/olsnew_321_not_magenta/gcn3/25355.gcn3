report on behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration

We processed the public data obtained by the DESGW team described in GCN 25336 using the image subtraction pipeline described in Goldstein, Andreoni et al. (2019) and Andreoni, Goldstein et al. (2019). By examining the subtractions in the vicinity of the optical counterpart candidate des-gw190814b (GCN 25336), we observed that the object is moving by 14.3 arcseconds per hour, in the same direction, in both the i- and z-bands. Based on this information it is very likely that this object is a Solar System Object, and thus is unrelated with the S190814bv gravitational wave event (GCN #25324). The object is not listed in the Minor Planet Center.
