A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol (University of
Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 061007 afterglow at 4.8, 8.6 and
19 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at October 8 10.25 UT
to 15.84 UT, i.e. 1.00 - 1.24 days after the burst (GCN 5707).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical afterglow
(GCN 5706). The formal flux measurement for a point source at the
location of the optical afterglow is -25 +/- 45 microJy at 4.8 GHz,
-13 +/- 47 microJy at 8.6 GHz, and -1 +/- 37 microJy at 19 GHz.

We would like to thank the staff of the Australia Telescope National
Facility, in particular Baerbel Koribalski, for obtaining these
Target of Opportunity observations."
