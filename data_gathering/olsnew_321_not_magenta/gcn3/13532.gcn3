TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13532
SUBJECT: GRB 120729A Gemini-N redshift 
DATE:    12/07/29 13:16:08 GMT

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) and J. Ball (Gemini) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 120729A (Ukwatta et al. GCN 13530)
using the GMOS-N spectrograph on Gemini-North.

Observations began at 2012-7-29 12:11 UT, about 75 mins post-burst.
The spectrum reveals strong absorption lines of MgI, MgII, FeII, MnII.  
A provisional reduction gives a redshift of z=0.80, which we believe is most 
likely the redshift of this burst.
