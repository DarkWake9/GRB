Using the data set from T-239 to T+800 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 211129A (trigger #1085430)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 31136).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 274.565, 31.781 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 18m 15.6s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 46' 51.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 83%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-2 s and ends at ~T+120 s. The three main peaks occur at ~T+1 s,
~T+29 s, and ~T+91 s, respectively. T90 (15-350 keV) is 113.01 +- 9.14 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.80 to T+124.11 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.75 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.99 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
