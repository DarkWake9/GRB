E. Berger (Princeton/OCIW) and B. Madore (OCIW) report:

"Starting on 2008 July 2.36 UT we observed the BAT error circle of GRB 
080702b (GCN #7924) using the du Pont 100-inch telescope at Las Campanas 
Observatory.  A total of 1500 sec were obtained in R-band in good seeing 
conditions (0.9").  A comparison to DSS reveals no new sources to the 
limit of the survey.  Further observations are planned."
