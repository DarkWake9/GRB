T. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), H. A. Krimm (NSF), S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC), A. Y. Lien (U Tampa), C. B. Markwardt (GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL), T. Sakamoto (AGU), M. Stamatikos (OSU), (i.e. the Swift-BAT team):
 
Using the full data set from recent downlinks, we report further ground data analysis for Swift trigger 1086826 (Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 31160).
 
The BAT analysis uses data from T-50 to T+250 sec. The BAT image significance is 3.9 sigma (15-350 keV). Also, the mask-weighted light curve does not show anything significant and there is no identified source in the ground analysis of the scaled map.
 
We therefore conclude that this event is likely due to noise and is not an astrophysical event.
