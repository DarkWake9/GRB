W. Fong (U. Arizona), B. J. Shappee (Carnegie) and E. Berger (Harvard)
report:

"We observed the location of the short-duration soft burst, Swift
J123205.1-105602, detected by Fermi/GBM (Trigger no. 441818617) and
Swift/BAT (Cummings; GCN 17267) with the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and
Spectrograph (IMACS) mounted on the Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope. We
obtained 8x150-sec of r-band observations at a mid-time of 2015 Jan 03.297
UT (1.66 days post-burst) in 0.8" seeing at an airmass of 1.6. Within the
XRT position (Cummings et al.; GCN 17268), we detect a faint point-like
optical source located at

RA(J2000) = 12:32:05.09
Dec(J2000) = -10:56:03.0

with an uncertainty of 1" in each coordinate (registered to 2MASS). We note
that this candidate optical afterglow is situated ~3" southeast from the
center of a bright catalogued galaxy 2MASX J12320498-1056010, also detected
by Swift/UVOT (Cummings et al.; GCN 17268).

Further observations are planned to determine the nature of this source."
