report on behalf of larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed of  the field of  the Swift GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al.,  GCN 
16142)  with 0.4-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory starting
on Mar., 20 (UT)  09:01:03.  The start of observation was delayed due to bad 
weather. We took unfiltered images of 30 s exposures. We detect a fading 
optical source  in coordinates

(J2000)  13 09 08.50 +49 50 29.4

(with initial accuracy of about 1 arcsec). Preliminary photometry of the 
source in the first   images is  ~ 17.2m. the photometry is based on nearby 
USNO-B1.0 stars (R2 mag). Since the source is absent in USNO-B1.0 catalog 
and clearly fading we suggest it as GRB 140423A afterglow candidate.

[GCN OPS NOTE(23apr14): Please see 16148 for the correction on the start date.
Also added the "A" on the GRB name in the first and last sentences.]
