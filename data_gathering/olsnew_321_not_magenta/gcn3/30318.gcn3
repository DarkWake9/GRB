and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 210624A
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 646189108), Konus-Wind,
and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) at about 3503 s UT (00:58:23).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    54.243 (03h 36m 58s) +80.364 (+80d 21' 49")
  Corners:
    50.629 (03h 22m 31s) +77.944 (+77d 56' 38")
    48.706 (03h 14m 49s) +77.917 (+77d 55' 01")
    60.700 (04h 02m 48s) +82.723 (+82d 43' 23")
    63.941 (04h 15m 46s) +82.672 (+82d 40' 18")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.96 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 5.36 deg (the minimum one is 22.7 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 58 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of,
the Fermi final position.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
