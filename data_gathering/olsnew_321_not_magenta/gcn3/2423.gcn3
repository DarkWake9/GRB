TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 86029
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 168.908,  17.800 degrees, whose radius is 65.084 +/-  0.029
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival direction to a band between ecliptic latitudes -50
and -30 degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus between
108,-8 and 126,-33 degrees, and between 159,-47 and 199,-41 degrees.

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.  It is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
