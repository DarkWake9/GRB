report for a larger collaboration:

"We observed the localization of GRB 111022B (Holland et al. GCN
12472) with the Gemini-North telescope, equipped with NIRI.
Observations were obtained in poor conditions (2.5" seeing) and
began 17 hours after the burst in the YJHK filters.

We find a single source within the refined XRT error circle (Beardmore
et al. GCN 12478). The source is well detected in both H and K,
with K~19.0 +/- 0.2, but only very weakly in J. Given the earlier
non-detections in the optical (Vreeswijk et al. GCN 12479) the
inferred optical-IR colour is red (R-K > 4.2), coupled with the
lack of apparent excess N_H this could be indicative of a high
redshift burst.

Analysis is ongoing, and further observations are planned."
