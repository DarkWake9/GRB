TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3674
SUBJECT: GRB 050724: Optical limit

K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the possible short GRB 050724 (Covino et
al. 3665, Krimm et al. GCN 3667) was observed by the 14 inch Automated
Response Telescope in Osaka. The imaging started at 2005 July 24
12:40:35 UT (75 s after the alert reception; 386 s after the
trigger) and RcIcBV frames of 60s integration were obtained.

 We find no optical counterpart for the X-ray afterglow (GCN 3665,
Romano et al. GCN 3669) and derive its 3-sigma upper limit
relative to USNO-B1.0 magnitude as follows.
