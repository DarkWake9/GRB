on behalf of the Watcher collaboration report:

The Watcher 40cm robotic telescope, located at Boyden Observatory, South 
Africa, began imaging the field of GRB 060526 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 
5162) at 16:29:07, 36.2 seconds after the Swift trigger (19.6 seconds 
after the GCN notice).

Preliminary analysis shows a varying source, consistent with the 
position of the OT detected in the UVOT observations, with an R-band 
magnitude of ~15 at T~60s. Analysis is on-going.
