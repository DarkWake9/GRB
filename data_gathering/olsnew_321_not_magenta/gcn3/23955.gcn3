report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-03-10T09:33:25.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190310A (trigger ID: HEB190310398) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (trigger number 573903157).
 
The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of Single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 8.18 s measured from T0-1.74 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.01 s, is 960 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 4615 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
