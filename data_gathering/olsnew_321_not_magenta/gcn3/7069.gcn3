P. Nugent (LBL) and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

"We have created a stacked image through the co-addition of 17  
unfiltered images taken by the NEAT collaboration and 42 images in  
the RG610 filter taken by the Palomar-Quest Consortium at the Palomar  
Oschin Schmidt telescope (obtained from 2001-2007), of GRB 071112C  
(Perri et al.; GCN 7059). The stacked image is significantly deeper  
than the DSS (3 sigma limit of R~24 mag).

There is no source at the position of the UVOT counterpart (Perri et  
al.; GCN 7059), however we do find a faint source 2.24" to the  
southwest inside the XRT error circle at position:

02:36:50.79 +28:22:15.3 J2000

A preliminary reduction yield a magnitude of  R=24.1 +/- 0.4 for that  
source."
