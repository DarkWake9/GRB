Swift Team:

At 03:38:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090708 (trigger=356776).  Swift did not slew because of 
Sun constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 154.629, +26.637 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 18m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 38' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows single peak
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position,
and it will not be observable until early October. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
