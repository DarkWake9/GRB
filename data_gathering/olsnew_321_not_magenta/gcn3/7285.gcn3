TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7285
SUBJECT: GRB 080210: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    08/02/10 11:56:08 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne and A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 193 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
V-band data for GRB 080210, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 251.26693, +13.82656 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 16h 45m 4.06s
Dec (J2000): +13d 49' 35.6"

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest position
can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position enhancement is
described by Goad et al. (2007, astro-ph/0708.0986
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf).

This circular was automatically generated, and is an official product of the
