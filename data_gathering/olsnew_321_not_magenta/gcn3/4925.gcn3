D. Sharapov (MAO, and NOT, La Palma), M. Ibrahimov (MAO) and A. Pozanenko
(IKI), on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed GRB 060211B (Mateos et al., GCN 4739; Tueller et al., GCN 4747)
with 1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in R-band on Feb.
20 (UT) 16:16 - 16:50 (Salyamov  et al., GCN 4744). In combined image we
marginally detect two objects within refined XRT error circle Page et al.
(GCN 4745):

id1:  RA(J2000) =  05:00:17.11
        Dec     = +14:57:01.06

id2:  RA(J2000) =  05:00:17.19
       Dec      = +14:56:55.74


Mid. time,   Exp.,  id1,         id2,       Limit,  Seeing
 (UT)         (s)

Feb.11.6895  6x300  22.1 +/-0.3  22.3 +/-0.3  22.1  ~1.3"

The photometry and astrometry is based on USNO B1.0. The both objects are
not detectable in separate images, in particular in the first image obtained
starting 20.7 minutes from burst onset.
