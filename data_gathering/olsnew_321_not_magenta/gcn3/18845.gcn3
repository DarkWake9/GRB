The long-duration GRB 160107A (MAXI/GSC, Nakagawa et al. GCN Circ. 18839; 
Fermi-GBM, Veres et al. GCN Circ. 18844) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor 
(CGBM) at 22:20:43.20 UT on 7 January 2016.  The clear burst signal was detected 
by all instruments.  

The light curve of the HXM shows at least three peaks starting and ending at 
T0 and T0+25 sec, T0+25 sec and T0+50 sec, and T0+52 sec and T0+80 sec, 
respectively.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 116.0 s +/- 12.5 sec (40-1000 keV).  

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
