The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 00:45:47 UT on 25 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190525A (trigger 580437952.651712 / 190525032).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 338.0, Dec = 5.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 32m, 5d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 43.0 degrees.
