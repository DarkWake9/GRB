collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al, 2020,
arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 210330A, which was also
detected by GECAM (GCN #29736).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light
curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-03-30 12:45:46.50 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the
burst is 262 (+45, -46) cts/s above the background in the combined data of
four quadrants, with a total 1367 (+248, -267) cts. The local mean
background count rate was 510 (+3, -3) cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we
measure a T90 of 13 (+2, -7) s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and
PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated
the project.
