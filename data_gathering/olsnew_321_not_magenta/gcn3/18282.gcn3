Kenshi Yanagisawa, Daisuke Kuroda, Yasuhiro Shimizu, Hideyuki Izumiura

and Nobuyuki Kawai(Tokyo Tech.) report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB150911A (Starling et al, GCN18280)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 18:56 UT on 11th September, just 16 min
after the BAT trigger, to 19:10 UT. The total exposure of 6 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the enhanced XRT error circle (Starling et al, GCN18280) down
to limiting magnitude of Ks=14.3 (Vega, S/N=10) . The photometric
calibration was made against 2MASS field stars.
