We observed the field of INTEGRAL Weak#8189 with the 14-inch
AGU Robotic Optical Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N)
located at the Sagamihara campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.

30 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
January 2 09:39:37 (UT) about 109 seconds after the trigger and stopped
on January 2 10:15:11 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow
both in the individual images and the stacked image.  The estimated
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1800 sec)
is ~18.9 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
