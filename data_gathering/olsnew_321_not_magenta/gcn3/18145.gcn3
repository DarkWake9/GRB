We continue to observe the field of GRB 150817A (V. D'Elia, et al., GCN 18143) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/08 17.14 to 2015/08 17.25 UTC (1.29 to 3.93 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.13 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We note that the source reported in Butler et al. (GCN 18144) appears to have remained constant in flux over the time period quoted above, while an uncatalogued source just west of the XRT error circle has faded strongly as t^(-0.8+/-0.1).  This second source is located at RA, Dec = 16:38:31.51, -12:03:9.6 (J2000, +/-0.5").

In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

   r = 22.06 +/- 0.09
   i = 21.49 +/- 0.07
   z > 20.33

These magnitudes, corresponding to the midpoint of our observation, are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
