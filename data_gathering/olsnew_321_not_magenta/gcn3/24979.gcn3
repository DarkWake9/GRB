The long-duration GRB 190701B (IBAS detection: Gotz et al., GCN 24936)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=36303.292 s UT (10:05:03.292).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
which starts at ~T0-3.3 s and has a total duration of ~13 s.
The emission is seen up to ~1.3 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 3.51(-0.46,+0.70)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0-0.072 s,
of 1.39(-0.63,+0.68)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1.3 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
withÂ  alpha = -1.43(-0.33,+0.41),
and Ep = 112(-30,+64) keV (chi2 = 48/60 dof).
Fitting by the GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index:
beta < -2.17 (chi2 = 48/59 dof).
