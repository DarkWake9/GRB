   M. De Pasquale (MSSL/UCL), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and M.
Stamatikos (GSFC) report on the behalf of the Swift team:

  At 2008-04-15 14:15UT Swift performed a TOO observation of the INTEGRAL
burst GRB 080414 (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 7618), some 56.6ks after
the trigger.

   No X-ray source was found in or near the IBAS error circle in a 3.9ks
exposure Swift/XRT Photon Counting mode image (taken from T+56.6ks to
T+85.5ks after the trigger) down to a 3 sigma limiting 0.3-10keV count
rate of 3e-3 count/s. Assuming a power-law spectrum of photon index 2
absorbed by the Galactic column density of 1.16e22 cm^-2 in the direction
of the burst, this corresponds to an observed 0.3-10keV flux limit of
1.9e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.


   The Swift/UVOT also observed the field. We do not detect an UV/Optical
afterglow in the IBAS error circle in all UVOT filters down to the
following 5 sigma upper limits:

   Filter  T_start  T_stop  Exp.    Mag UL (5sig)
           (ks)     (ks)    (s)

   v       56.9     79.9    272     > 18.3
   b       56.7     79.5    272     > 19.4
   u       56.7     84.7    326     > 19.2
   uvw1    56.6     84.7   1001     > 19.9
   uvm2    57.0     80.1    564     > 19.4
   uvw2    56.8     79.8   1085     > 19.9

   These upper limits are not corrected for the very large Galactic
extinction in the line of sight to GRB 080414, corresponding to a
reddening of E(B-V)=6.95 mag (Schlegel et al., 1998, ApJS, 500, 525). We
note that this value is rather uncertain in this direction.
The photometry is based on the UVOT photometric system described in Poole
et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).

was changed to "T+56.6ks to T+85.5ks".]
