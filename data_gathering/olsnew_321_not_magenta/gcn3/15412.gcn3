A. S. Moskvitin,
reports on behalf of SAO RAS GRB follow-up team:

We observed the field of GRB 131030A (Troja et al., GCN#15402)
with the 1-meter telescope Zeiss-1000 of Special Astrophysical
Observatory of RAS in four bands: B, V, Rc, Ic. Observations
were started since 23 minutes after the Swift trigger.
The weather conditions were excellent, but the air masses of
the object was about 3-6.

Optical counterpart was clearly detected at all images.
Preliminary results of Rc band photometry are as following:

T_mid, UT   T - T0, h   exposure, s   R mag   +/- error
21:18:45    0.374        60           16.55 +/- 0.02
21:34:05    0.630        60           17.09 +/- 0.03
21:44:14    0.799       120           17.26 +/- 0.02
21:56:27    1.003       120           17.39 +/- 0.03
22:07:26    1.186       120           17.53 +/- 0.03
22:21:30    1.420       360           17.63 +/- 0.02
22:30:08    1.564       480           17.69 +/- 0.03

The magnitudes were calibrated against the set of USNO B1 stars
(R2) and not corrected for the Galaxy extinction.
