We observed the field of GRB 171102B (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 22082) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/11 3.14 to 2017/11 3.20 UTC (11.99 to
13.55 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.98 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.42 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne, et al., GCN
22084), in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the
following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r > 22.51
 i > 22.59
 Z > 21.14
 Y > 21.53
 J > 21.36
 H > 20.97

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.
