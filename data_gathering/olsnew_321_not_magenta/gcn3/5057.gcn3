on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have imaged the field of  GRB 060502B (Troja et al. GCN 5055) with
clear, R and I band  using the  0.8m  telescope  at  Xinglong Observatory. 
 First imaging was started from 305 s after the trigger.  The limiting
magnitude is  clear = ~  20 (12 min  after) and R=20.6 (60  min after)
derived  from  USNO-B1.0 r  catalog.   No  new  source was  detected
brighter than the limits in the XRT error circle.

Further analysis is in progress."
