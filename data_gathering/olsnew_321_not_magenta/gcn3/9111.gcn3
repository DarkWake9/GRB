The MASTER II Wide Field Telescope located at Kourovka Observatory (Ural)
(two telescopes with D=400 mm, FOW = 2x4 square degrees, 2x16 Mpx CCD on 
one NTM mount) has observed  Swift error box  (Stroh et al., GCN 9110)
with 60s exposure started at 1h 27m after Trigger time 
(after sun set) simultaneously in two filters R and V.
MASTER-II is the new site of the MASTER-Net (http://observ.pereplet.ru/).
Actually, we observed from the city.

Our  images are calibrated relative to USNO B (R) & Tycho stars (V).
The wether is not very good.

We do not detect OT inside error box brighter ~17m (S/N=6).

The reduction is continued.
