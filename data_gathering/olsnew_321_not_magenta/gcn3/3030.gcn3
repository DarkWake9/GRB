report:

 We observed the SWIFT/BAT error region for GRB 050215b ( Barthelmy et
al. GCN 3024) using Lulin 1-m telescope at Taiwan. We imaged a V-band
300 sec exposure at 15.65 UT (~ 13.07 hrs after the burst ) and a
I-band 300 sec at 17.14 UT ( ~ 14.56 hrs after the burst ). No new
source was found around X-ray source reported by Page et al. (GCN
3027) at our two observations. Compare with USNO-B1 I band stars, the
limiting magnitudes are V ~ 19 and I ~ 20 (3 sigma).
