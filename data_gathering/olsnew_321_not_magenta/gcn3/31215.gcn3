The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:46:26 UT on 12 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211212B (trigger 661005991.438832 / 211212532).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 41.8, Dec = -25.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 47m, -25d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 98.0 degrees.
