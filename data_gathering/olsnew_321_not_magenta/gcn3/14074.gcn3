A. N. Morgan (UC Berkeley) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 121212A (Grupe et al., GCN 14064) with
the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began
at 2012-Dec-12 09h50m10s UT, ~2.9 hours after the Swift trigger.  In
mosaics (effective exposure time of 1.96 h) taken simultaneously in
the J, H, and Ks filters, we do not detect any source at the afterglow
location (Kuin et al., GCN 14069; Perley and Horesh, GCN 14070; Elenin
et al., GCN 14071; Cenko, GCN 14072).
