Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190706B (trigger #913302)
(Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circ. 24993).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 107.443, -29.575 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 09m 46.4s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 34' 30.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 69%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T0 and ends at ~T+30 s. The highest peak occurs at ~T+1 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 25.16 +- 6.35 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.25 to T+27.48 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.90 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.8 +- 0.9 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
