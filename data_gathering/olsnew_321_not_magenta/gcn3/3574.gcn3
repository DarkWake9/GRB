behalf of the Swift XRT team:
The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050712 at 14:00:27.51 UT on 12 July 
2005 (Grupe et al. 2005, GCN 3573).  The observatory executed an automated 
slew to the BAT position and the XRT began taking data at 14:03:14 UT 
(166.1 s after the BAT trigger).  The XRT was in Auto state but the source 
was not initially bright enough for a successful on-board centroid.  In 
ground-processed data we find a bright uncataloged, rapidly fading X-ray 
source located at:

RA(J2000) = 05:10:47.9,
Dec(J2000) = +64:54:51.5.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds radius (90% 
containment).   This source is located 56 arcseconds from the BAT position 
in GCN 3573.
