on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 
2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed detection of a long GRB 220527A which was 
also reported by AGILE (Ursi et al. GCN 32129), Fermi-GBM (GCN 32130), 
Fermi-LAT (Bissaldi et al., GCN 32131), Swift-XRT (Sbarufatti et al., 
GCN 32135), Swift-UVOT (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 32136) and CALET (Yamaoka 
et al., GCN 32139).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The 
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 
2022-05-27 09:17:23.55 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with 
the burst is 1879 (+251, -171) counts/s above the background in the 
combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 5318 (+224, -235) 
counts. The local mean background count rate was 496 (+4, -5) counts/s. 
Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 7 (+1, -1) s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector 
in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks 
of emission with the strongest peak at 2022-05-27 09:17:19.39 UTC. The 
measured peak count rate is 1880 (+96, -93) counts/s above the 
background in the combined Veto data of four quadrants, with a total of 
11483 (+534, -559) counts. The local mean background count rate was 1644 
(+6, -6) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 14 (+3, -2) s from the cumulative 
Veto light curve.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at 
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb [1]. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led 
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, 
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and 
facilitated the project.
