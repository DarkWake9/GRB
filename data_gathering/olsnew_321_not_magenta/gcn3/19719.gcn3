Using the data set from T-240 to T+877 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160716A (trigger #704572)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 19716).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 190.502, -61.364 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 42m 00.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -61d 21' 51.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows at least 2 overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-5sec, peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.39 +- 0.57 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.43 to T+6.73 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.29 +- 0.30.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.95 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
