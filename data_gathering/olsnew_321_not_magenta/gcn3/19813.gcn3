The AMI Large Array triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 160804A 
(Marshall et al., GCN 19761) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 12 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Aug 04.85, Aug 05.75, Aug 
07.75, Aug 11.75, and Aug 16.67 (UT) reveal a transient radio source at 
the XRT location (Osborne et al., GCN 19762), with flux densities of 
<141 uJy (3sigma), 189+/-46 uJy, 583+/-40 uJy, 292+/-34 uJy, and 
168+/-38 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
