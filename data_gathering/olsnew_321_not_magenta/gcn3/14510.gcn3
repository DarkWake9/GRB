Skynet continued observing the Swift/XRT localization of GRB 130427A 
(Maselli et al., GCN 14448, Swift trigger #554620) with four 16" 
telescopes of the PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile, starting at 2013-04-28, 
23:06 UT, and continuing until 04-29, 3:51 UT (t=39.28h-44.03h 
post-trigger). It took ~110 160-s exposures, simultaneously in each of 
the BVRI bands. We performed photometry on each exposure, calibrated to 
two SDSS stars in the field. B-band photometry was performed on stacks 
of 3-4 images in order to provide at least 3sigma detections.

See Trotter et al. (GCN 14497) for a description of the first night's 
observations.  Further Skynet observations are ongoing.
