report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 01:26:10.85 UT on 24 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 081124 (trigger 249182771 / 081124060).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 336.5, DEC = -15.5 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 22 h 26 m, -15 d 32 '), with an uncertainty
of 3.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of 2 pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 35 s (8-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.6 s to T0+25.1 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 22.8 +/- 0.7 keV,
alpha = -0.6 +/- 0.2, and beta = -2.83 +/- 0.08.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.5 +/- 2.6)E-08 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
in the 8-1000 keV band is 0.67 +/- 0.18 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
