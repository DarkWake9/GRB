Using the data set from T-239 to T+750 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070110 (trigger #255445)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 6005).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 0.934, -52.978 deg which is
     RA(J2000)  =  00h 03m 44.2s
     Dec(J2000) = -52d 58' 39.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.

The mask-tagged light curve shows a very broad peak beginning at T-3 sec and
peaking at T+0 sec.  Then there is a slow exponential decline in the 
light curve
out to T+135 s, with two or three additional peaks superimposed.  T90 
(15-350 keV)
is 85 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.7 to T+100.6 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.1 x 
10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
