Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Chris Phillips (Australia Telescope National Facility), Gregory Taylor
(University of New Mexico), Mark Wieringa (Australia Telescope National
Facility) and Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the BAT refined position of the GRB 080130 (GCN 7248) at 4.8
and 8.456 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on May
31, 2008 between 09:15:05 UT and 13:07:05 UT.

We did not detect a radio source at the BAT position of the GRB 080130
(GCN 7248). The radio flux density at the GRB position is -0.153 +/-
0.246 mJy at 4.8 GHz, and 0.113 +/- 0.284 mJy at 8.6 GHz (1-sigma).

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
