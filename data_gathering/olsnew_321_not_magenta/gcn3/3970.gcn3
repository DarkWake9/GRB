report on behalf of the Swift team:

As of about 20:03 UT Sept. 11, 2005, Swift returned to normal operations.
Swift had temporarily lost star tracker lock at 16:13 UT, and a series
of 12 false burst notices were distributed (GCN circ. 3963).  The trigger 
numbers of the false burst notices were between 154632 and 154648 
inclusive.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  We do not anticipate any
heightened probability that this anomaly will reoccur in the future.

We repeat that trigger 154630 at 15:59:34 UT (GCN circ. 3961) was a real 
burst, GRB 050911, and the BAT data for that burst was not affected by 
the star tracker anomaly.
