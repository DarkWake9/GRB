report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130206A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 547918) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 106s after the GRB trigger
(73s after the notice). The elevation of the field
decreased from 48 degrees above horizon and weather
conditions were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT in the BAT error box with a
limiting magnitude of:
t0+106s to t0+166s : R > 16.5

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+187s to t0+217s : R > 18.3

We co-added a series of images in tracking mode:
t0+187s to t0+482s : R > 20.1

The analysis was made by substraction with images
acquired one hour later.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=278.0587 lat=-5.8228
and the corresponding galactic absorption in R band
should be about 1.1 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
