"At 00:08:39.16 UT on 14 May 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090514 (trigger 263952521 / 090514006).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 12.3, DEC = -10.9 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 0 h 49 m, -10 d 54'), with an uncertainty
of 4.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 49 s (8-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.5 s to T0+56.8 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with index -1.92 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.1 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.256 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 7.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
