K. L. Page (U Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5.6 ks of XRT data for GRB 220907A (Page et al. GCN
Circ. 32526), from 100 s to 21.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. Using 188 s of PC mode data
and 1 UVOT image, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 268.87315, -20.28950 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 17h 55m 29.56s
Dec(J2000): -20d 17' 22.2"

with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The source
is fading with alpha >0.4.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
