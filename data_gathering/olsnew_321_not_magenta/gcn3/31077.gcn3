The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:34:22 UT on 12 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211112A (trigger 658420467.373122 / 211112607).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 138.4, Dec = -2.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 13m, -2d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 15.0 degrees.
