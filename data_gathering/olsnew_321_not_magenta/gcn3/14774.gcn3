Nicuesa Guelbenzu, A. (TLS Tautenburg), J. Greiner, Varela, K. (MPE 
Garching), S. Klose, D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) report on behalf of the 
GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 130605A (Swift trigger 557508; Holland et 
al., GCN 14773) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla 
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 23:44:36 UT on June 6, about 3 min after the GRB 
trigger. Inside the BAT error circle (Holland et al., GCN 14773) we find a 
source at coordinates RA, DEC (J2000) = 08:58:08.6, -33:27:40.3 which has 
no counterpart on the DSS2 red. We measure the following preliminary AB 
magnitude (mean time 23:47:39)

r' = 15.8 +/- 0.1,

calibrated against GROND zeropoints and 2MASS stars. We suggest that this 
is the GRB afterglow.
