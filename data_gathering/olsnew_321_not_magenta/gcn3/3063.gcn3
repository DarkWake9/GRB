TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IBAS GRB Alert #2321
DATE:    05/02/24 17:04:07 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz (IASF, Milano) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team Reports:

IBAS Alert #2321 is not due to a real GRB, but was caused by a known 
variable source, which was wrongly localized due to the incorrect attitude 
information available at the time of the burst.
