MASTER-VWF robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) in 
Kislovodsk was pointed to the GRB130216A 15 sec after notice time and 31 
sec after GRB time at 2013-02-16 22:15:52.273 UT using FERMI coordinates 
(V.Chaplin et. al. GCN14236).  We observ  SWIFT error-box by very wide 
field cameras (FOV=400 sq. deg. d=8.2 cm) and  haven`t found optical 
transient on images with 5-sigma upper limit has been about 8 mag.

MASTER II  robotic telescope  located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the 
GRB130216A 23 sec  after notice time and 582 sec after GRB time at 
2013-02-16 22:25:06.231 UT. On our first (120s exposure) set we haven`t 
found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box (A. Melandri  et. al. 
GCN14223).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14.0 mag

All Ïbservations were made on high (z>85 deg.) zenith distances and in bad 
weather condition .
