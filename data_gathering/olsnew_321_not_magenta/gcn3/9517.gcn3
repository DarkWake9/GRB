Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

We have analyzed the KAIT observations on GRB 090618 (GCN 9512) as
reported in GCN 9514. Our first 2s unfiltered observation started
at 08:29:44 UT, 75 s after the BAT trigger. The OA as reported in
GCN 9512, 9513, 9514, and 9515 is clearly detected. Subsequent 
observations show that the OA declined and reached a bottom at t=92 s,
then brightened and reached a peak at t=120 s. After the peak, the
OA declined as a smooth power-law, with an obvous change of decay
index at t ~ 600 s (from alpha = -1.08 +/- 0.05 to -0.70 +/- 0.02). 
Selected photometry, all unfiltered calibrated to the R band via USNO B1:
