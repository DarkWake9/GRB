S. Maticic, B. Dintinjana and H. Mikuz on behalf of PIKA observing 
program at Crni Vrh Observatory.

We observed the field of GRB 120116A (GCN 12834) from Crni Vrh 
Observatory with a 60 cm robotic telescope, R filter and CCD. Twenty 
consecutive exposures of 60 second duration were taken. First exposure 
started at 2012-01-16 18:07:47 UT, 79 seconds after the burst (60 
seconds after the SWIFT trigger).

No optical candidate was detected within the uncertainty radius on 
single exposures, having R limiting magnitude 20.0 +/-0.2. Also we found 
no optical candidate on 20 sumed R images with total exposure of 1200 
seconds and limiting R band magnitude 22.0 +/-0.2 (all magnitudes 
calibrated against the nearby USNO B1.0 R2 magnitude stars).
