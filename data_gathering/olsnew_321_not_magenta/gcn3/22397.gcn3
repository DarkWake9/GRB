We observed the afterglow of GRB 180205A (Evans et al., GCN 22381; Zheng et
al. GCN 22382; Bolmer et al. GCN 22383; Tanvir et al. GCN 22384; Volnova et
al. GCN 22387; Falcon et al. GCN 22380; Xin et al. 22392; Zhu et al. 22395;
Emery et al. 22396) with the 1-m telescope at the Mt. Lemmon Optical
Astronomy Observatory (LOAO) and the 0.8m and 0.25 telescopes at the
McDonald Observatory. The observation started at about 1 hour after the
initial alert, using B, V, R, I, z, and Y filters. The observation
continued throughout the night.

We clearly identify the optical afterglow in these bands, and
​a ​
preliminary photometry in R-band shows R ~ 18 mag at 1.3 hours post-burst.

Further observations and analysis are being carried out
​, including telescopes in Korea​
. Additional
​results ​
will be reported
​ as they become available​
.
