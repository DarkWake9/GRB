Observatory Team:

At 16:09:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220706A (trigger=1114937).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 0.587, -16.391 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 02m 21s
   Dec(J2000) = -16d 23' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex structure
 with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 16:10:57.0 UT, 102.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 0.60368, -16.41065 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 02m 24.88s
   Dec(J2000) = -16d 24' 38.3"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 91 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.40 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 6.6
(+4.12/-3.33) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 107 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.025.
