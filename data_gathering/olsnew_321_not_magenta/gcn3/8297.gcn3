Using the data set from T-239 to T+494 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080928 (trigger #326115)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 8292).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 95.061, -55.176 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 20m 14.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 10' 34.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 84%.
 
With all the data downlinked, the mask-weighted light curve shows
that BAT triggered on a weak blip that occurred long before the
main emission of this burst.  The initial peak started at ~T-10 sec,
peaked at ~T_zero, and returned to baseline around T+30 sec.
Then a second, slightly larger peak, started at ~T+50 and ended at ~T+130 sec.
Then the main emission started at ~T+170, with a pair of peaks at ~T+205 and
~T+215 sec.  The emaission tails down to almost background at T+400 sec
at which time Swift started to enter the SAA and the errors on the flux
become large.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 280 +- 30 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+51.1 to T+381.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+202.83 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
