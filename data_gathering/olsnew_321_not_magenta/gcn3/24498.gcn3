We have analysed 4.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 190511A (Bernardini et al.
GCN Circ. 24472), from 129 s to 46.3 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data comprise 188 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 24481).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.177 (+0.031, -0.028).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.07 (+0.08, -0.07). The
best-fitting absorption column is  consistent with the Galactic value
of 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has
a photon index of 2.12 (+0.24, -0.23) and a best-fitting absorption
column of 1.6 (+0.7, -0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed
(unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this
spectrum  is 3.2 x 10^-11 (4.5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.6 (+0.7, -0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.12 (+0.24, -0.23)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.177, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 9.3 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.0 x
10^-13 (4.2 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
