The long GRB 170214A (Fermi-GBM detection: Mailyan & Meegan, GCN 20675;
Fermi-LAT detection: Racusin et al., GCN 20676)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=56076.276 s UT (15:34:36.276)

The light curve shows count rate increase around ~T0-50 s
followed by a bright, multi-peaked structure
which starts at ~T0-14 s and has a total duration of ~150 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(2.41 ± 0.17)x10^-4 erg/cm2 and a 64-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+52.480, of (8.77 ± 0.13)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+147.968 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.70 (-0.06,+0.07),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.61 (-0.27,+0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 330 (-19,+21) keV,
chi2 = 96/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate (measured from T0+47.360
to T0+56.248 s) is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.75 (-0.12,+0.15),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.56 (-1.15,+0.33),
the peak energy Ep = 412 (-68,+73) keV,
chi2 = 110/97 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.

[GCN OPS NOTE(15feb17): Per author's request, the value for the
peak energy flux was changed from "10^-5" to "10^-6".]
