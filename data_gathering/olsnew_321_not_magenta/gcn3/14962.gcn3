V. Pelassa (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:27:06.27 UT on July 1st 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130701B (trigger 394334829 / 130701060).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 97.8, DEC = -60.1 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to +06h 31m, -60d 07'), with an uncertainty
of 1.00 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 132 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 20 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.048 s to T0+12.288 s
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.04 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 564 +/- 55 keV
(Castor statistics 599.92 for 492 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.28 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.52 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.5 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
