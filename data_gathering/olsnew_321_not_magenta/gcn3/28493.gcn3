The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:38:29 UT on 24 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200924B (trigger 622618714 / 200924235).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 319.4, Dec = 6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 18m, +6d 28'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.2 degrees.
