Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201024A (trigger #1001514)
(F. E. Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 28761).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 125.959, 3.357 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 23m 50.3s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 21' 24.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 22%.

The BAT light curve showed a single peak structure with a duration of about 6 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.00 +- 2.24 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.01 to T+6.01 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.10 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.1 +- 0.9 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.7 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
