E. Ambrosi (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (SSDC), J. A. Kennea (PSU) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 00:08:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a burst from the Soft Gamma Repeater SGR 1935+2154 (trigger=933276). 
Swift did not slew to this burst due to merit compared with the 
pre-planned target.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 293.743, +21.915 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 34m 58s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 54' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a short peak
structure with a duration of about 0.5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~19000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.
