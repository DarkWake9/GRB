report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration:

We performed additional analysis to estimate the localization contour of GRB 200415A detected at high energy by Fermi-LAT (GCN 27586).
The best localization is at: R.A., Dec. = 11.07, -25.02 (degrees, J2000) with a circular error of 0.38 and 0.59 degrees (statistical only), respectively at 68% and 90% confidence levels.

The shape of the contour shows an elongation toward the location of the IPN error box (GCN 27595) placing the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253) between the 68% and the 90% c.l. contours.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Alessandra Berretta (alessandra.berretta@pg.infn.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. 
It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
