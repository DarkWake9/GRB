M.C. Stroh and C. Pagani (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed the Swift-XRT data obtained for GRB 081012 (Stroh et  
al., GCN Circ. 8361), totaling 30.4ks of Photon Counting data.

The X-ray light-curve can be fit by a simple power law with a decay  
index of 1.49 +/- 0.07.

The spectrum can be fit with an absorbed power-law with absorption  
consistent with the Galactic nH value (2.37e20 cm-2, Kalberla et al.  
2005) and with a photon index of 1.44 (+0.35/-0.34). The average  
observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux is 6.19e-11 (6.40e-11) ergs/cm^2/ 
s.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
