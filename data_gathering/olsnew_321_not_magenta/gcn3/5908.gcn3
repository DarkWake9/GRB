M. Denis (CBK, Warsaw), R. Marcinkowski (IPJ, Swierk), T. Bulik (CAMK,
Warsaw), P. Goldoni, P. Laurent (APC, Paris; CEA Saclay) report:

The bright GRB061126 (Sbarufati et al. GCN 5854; Krimm et al., GCN 5860)
was at 90.4 degrees from the pointing axis of the INTEGRAL satellite
It was clearly detected by the SPI ACS.

In the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope a measurable flux was detected by the ISGRI
instrument, the PICsIT instrument and in the coincidence Compton events.
The Compton image of this burst does not show excess at the source
position due to the high GRB off-axis angle (see Marcinkowski et al. 2006
A&A 452,113 for details of the analysis).

The ISGRI spectrum of the first peak,lasting 2.2 s, was fitted up to 900
keV with a single powerlaw with a photon index of 1.1 +/- 0.15, consistent
with the RHESSI results (Bellm et al. GCN 5867).
