B. A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of the
CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient Universe"
and a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of GRB 130420B (Oates et al.; GCN 14411) 
beginning 2013 Apr 23.29 UT (dt = 2.75 d) with the Very Large Array 
(VLA) and beginning 2013 Apr 22.91 (dt = 2.37 d) with the Combined Array 
for Research at Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA).  We do not find any 
significant radio emission at the position of the enhanced Swift-XRT 
position (Page et al.; GCN 14421) at a mean frequency of 5.8 GHz (VLA) 
to a 3-sigma limit of 32 uJy, at 21.8 GHz (VLA) to a 3-sigma limit of 47 
uJy, or at 85 GHz (CARMA) to a 3-sigma limit of 0.78 mJy.

We thank the VLA and CARMA observatories for their support of these 
observations."
