S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and J. Mao (INAF-OAB) report on the
behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

       The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 081127 starting 113 s
after the BAT trigger (Mao, et al. 2008, GCN Circ. 8560).  Settled
exposures started at T+131 s.  We do not find any new source, relative
to the DSS or 2MASS, or any variable source inside the UVOT-enhanced
XRT error circle (Beardmore, et al. 2008, GCN Circ. 8565).
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits for detecting a source in the white
finding chart, and the co-added images, using a 2.5 arcsecond radius
circular aperture, are

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction along the line of sight corresponding to a
reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.09 mag (Schlegel, et al., 1998, ApJS, 500,
525).  All photometry is on the UVOT photometry system described in
Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).

      The B = 13.15 mag USNO-B1.0 star 0968-0627697 is located
approximately 4 arcsec north of the XRT position.  UVOT photometry at
the location of the X-ray source is contaminated by this star.
