"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and Wide Field Camera
(WFC unit 2) observed a gamma-ray burst on June 20.23169 UT.
A preliminary analysis reveals a duration of about 15 s in the GRBM,
with a peak photon countrate of 934 cts/s in the 40-700 keV energy
band. In the WFC, the duration is about 20 s and the peak flux is
2.8 Crab (2-26 keV). The position of the X-ray counterpart is
R.A.= 7h 35m 17.2s Decl.= +69d 11' 35" (equinox 2000.0) with a 99%
error radius of 3.6'. A follow-up NFI observation could not be performed
due to solar constraints."
