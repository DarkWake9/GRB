behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind, MESSENGER GRNS, and Mars Odyssey HEND observed this
burst at 34766 s on November 30, 2010.  As seen by Konus-Wind, the 
time history displayed a short (~1.5 s long) pulse, and a weak 
pulse at ~T0+50 s (with a duration of ~6 s). There is evidence
for this second pulse in the MESSENGER data at the same time after 
the main pulse, confirming their common origin.

We have localized it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are

	         RA(2000)			  Dec(2000)
CENTER:     61.803o=04 h 07 m 12.73 s    -16.759o=-16 o 45 '  33.09 "
CORNERS:    62.468o=04 h 09 m 52.39 s    -17.210o=-17 o 12 '  34.62 "   
            62.953o=04 h 11 m 48.62 s    -17.213o=-17 o 12 '  45.80 "      
            60.654o=04 h 02 m 37.06 s    -16.270o=-16 o 16 '  11.27 "    
            61.144o=04 h 04 m 34.57 s    -16.297o=-16 o 17 '  48.56 "

The error box area is ~1500 sq. arcmin.  This error box may be improved.
Time history and spectral information will be reported in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
