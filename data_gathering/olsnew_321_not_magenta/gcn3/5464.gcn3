P. Romano (INAF-OAB), D.N. Burrows (PSU), N. Gehrels (GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Based on the most recent downlinked data on GRB060814 (trigger number
224552) we find clear evidence of a break in the light curve at
42(+/-6) ks from the burst trigger (see the light curve at
http://www.brera.inaf.it/~moretti/grbplot/xrt060814.gif )
which could be a jet break.
The light curve slope steepens from 1.04+/-0.05 to 1.9+/-0.3
(errors are quoted at 90% confidence level).
In order to convert the XRT count rate to absorbed (unabsorbed)
flux the conversion factor is 4.9E-11 (8.5E-11)

Therefore we encourage optical data collection on this GRB in order to
measure the redshift and to test whether this break is achromatic.
