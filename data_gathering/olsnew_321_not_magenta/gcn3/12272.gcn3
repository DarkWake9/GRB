J. C. Tello, A. Sota and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on behalf
of a larger collaboration, report:

"We observed SGR 1834.9-0846/ GRB 110807A detected by Swift/BAT (D'Elia et
al., GCNC 12253, Barthelmy, GCN 12259) with the OSN 1.5m telescope. I-band
frames were obtained on 7 Aug, starting 16 min after the gamma-ray detection
(i.e. simultaneously to the BTA Rc-band observations, Moskvitin et al., GCNC
12254). Neither on the single I-band images (10s exposure time each) nor on
the co-added frames, taken between 20:14 and 21:48 UT, with total exposure
4820 sec, an object is detected within the Swift/XRT error box. The limiting
magnitude for the combined image is I = 21.6 (calibrated against USNO
B1.0)."
