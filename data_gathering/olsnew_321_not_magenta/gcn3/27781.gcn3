The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:36:39 UT on 22 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200522B (trigger 611854604.46714 / 200522650).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 87.0, Dec = -39.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 47m, -39d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 41.0 degrees.
