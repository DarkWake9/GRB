behalf of the BATSE Team:

On 1999 October 14.911512 UT, BATSE triggered on GRB991014 (trigger # 7803).
The burst time history shows a primary emission pulse comprised of several
sub-pulses lasting a few seconds followed by a weak and soft pulse. The T90 
and T50 measured durations are 4.67 (+/- 0.47) and 1.22 (+/- 0.14) seconds, 
respectively. Although short, this burst is still classified as a Class I 
burst in the BATSE GRB Hardness-Duration scatter plot. The burst is soft, 
with marginal emission above 300 keV and an energy fluence hardness ratio 
(100-300 keV / 50-100 keV) equal to 1.36 (+/- 0.13). The 50-300 keV peak 
flux of the burst measured on the 64 ms timescale is 2.58 (+/- 0.26) 
photons/s/cm^2 and 4.87 (+/- 0.53) ergs/s/cm^2, placing it in the upper
32% of the BATSE peak flux distribution. The fluence (> 25 keV) of the 
burst is 1.712 (+/- 0.471) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2, ranking in the top 58% of
the fluence distribution. The BATSE location is consistent with the 
BeppoSAX WFC error circle and IPN annulus. The BATSE light curve will 
soon be available at:
