M. C. Stroh (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift took an additional 7.6ks observation of GRB 090126A centered at T 
+29ks after the trigger. The single uncatalogued X-ray source  
previously reported by Stroh et al. (GCN Circ. 8854) shows fading  
flux, confirming its afterglow nature.

The 0.3-10 keV light curve can be fit using a simple power law model  
with decay index alpha = 1.42 +/- 0.13.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
