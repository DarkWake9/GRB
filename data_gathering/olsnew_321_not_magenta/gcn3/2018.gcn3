SUBJECT: GRB 030329, optical photometry

Photometry of the GRB 030329 afterglow (Peterson & Price: GCN
1985; Torii: GCN 1986) has been obtained with the Fred
L. Whipple 1.2m telescope beginning March 30.10 (UT). The
R-band images show a power-law decay index of -1.9 between
14 and 18 hours after the burst. This is significantly steeper
than the decay index of -0.9 derived from the photometry
of Rykoff & Smith (GCN 1995) and Burenin et al. (GCN 2001)
obtained within 8 hours of the burst. A break in the light curve
appears to have occurred between 0.3 and 0.5 days after
the burst.

The post-break light curve is well fit by

               R=16.3+1.9*2.5*log(age in days)

with the calibration based on that of Martini et al. (GCN 2013).
