     The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observing
the field of GRB 050315 (GCN 3094) at 21:01:13 UT, approximately 90
seconds after the BAT trigger.  The first image was sent down via the
TDRSS link approximately 200 seconds after the trigger.  This image
was a 100 second exposure taken with the V filter.  It was centred on
the BAT position, and had a size of 5 x 5 arcminutes, which covered
88% of the BAT error circle.  The middle of the exposure was 140.19
seconds after the BAT trigger.  The image was binned 8 x 8 to reduce
the bandwidth required for transmission.  A comparison against the DSS
showed no new sources down to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of
approximately V = 18.5.  We stress that this limiting magnitude is
based on ground calibrations and may be uncertain by approximately 0.5
mag.  The full-resolution version of this image will be transmitted to
the ground during the next Malindi pass, which will occur at
approximately 0000 UTC March 16, 2005.
