Dirk Grupe (PSU), Paul Kuin (MSSL), Jay Cummings (GSFC), and Kim Page (U
Leicester) report of behalf of the Swift team:


Swift observed the field of GRB 080524 (Sato et al., GCN Circ. 7774) as 
a Target
of Opportunity for 10 ks starting on 2008-05-25 at 16:43:45 UT, 36h 30m 
after
the burst. The exposures in XRT and UVOT V were 8.9 and 9.7 ks, 
respectively.
Within the 2.5' BAT error circle no new source was found. In XRT the 3sigma
upper limit is in the 0.5-8.0 keV band is 1.1e-3 counts/s which converts to
roughly 4.7e-14 ergs/s/cm2 in the 0.3-10.0 keV band assuming an
absorbed power law model with Galactic NH (5.19e20 cm-2) and a canonical 
X-ray
Photon index Gamma=2.0.
The 3sigma upper limit in the UVOT V-Filter is 20.0 mag.

No further Swift observations are planned for this GRB.

 This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
