(Carnegie Observatories) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie
Collaboration:

We have obtained 2 x 30 minute spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 050416
(a) with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer mounted on the 10-m
Keck I Telescope.  Observations were taken on 6 June, 2005 UT.  We
identify several emission lines including [OII], H-beta, H-gamma, and H-
delta at a redshift of z = 0.6535 +/- 0.0002.

The spectrum indicates the host galaxy is faint and blue with large
amounts of ongoing star formation.  We note the redshift is consistent
with the prediction of Fox (3408) based on the afterglow detection in
the Swift UVOT UVW2 filter.  

Using a fluence of 3.8e-7 erg/cm^2 (10 - 350 keV, GCN 3273), we find an
isotropic gamma-ray energy release of 7.0e50 ergs.
