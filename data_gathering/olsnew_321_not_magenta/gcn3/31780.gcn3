CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al.,
2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed detection of a long GRB 220316A which was
also detected by Fermi - GBM (TrigNum - 669122742), and Konus - Wind
(GCN Notices).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2022-03-16 11:25:40.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with
the burst is 266 (+48, -18) counts/s above the background in the
combined data of three quadrants, with a total of 2313 (+321, -294)
counts. The local mean background count rate was 361 (+2, -3) counts/s.
Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 30 (+6, -4) s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector
in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks
of emission with the strongest peak at 2022-03-16 11:25:39.22 UT. The
measured peak count rate is 887 (+76, -73) counts/s  above the
background in the combined Veto data of four quadrants, with a total of
4547 (+524, -584) counts. The local mean background count rate was 1454
(+4, -4) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 25 (+5, -2) s from the cumulative
Veto light curve.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb [1]. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC,
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and
facilitated the project.
