(PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the Fermi-GBM and
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 201216A (GBM team, GCN Circ. 29057;
Tohuvavohu et al. GCN Circ. 29059), collecting 4.9 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+21.5 ks and T0+34.2 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 197
arcsec of the Swift/BAT position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field
ranges from ~0.002 to ~0.003 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV
observed flux of 7.3e-14 to 1.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical
GRB spectrum).

Seven uncatalogued sources were detected too far from the GRB position
to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021408.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
