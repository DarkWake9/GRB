The long GRB 170306B (Fermi-LAT detection: Omodei et al., GCN 20826;
Fermi-GBM detection: Veres et al., GCN 20827)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=50850.920 s UT (14:07:30.920)

The light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~25 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(3.4 ± 0.4)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 64-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+3.712, of (4.1 ± 0.6)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+22.528 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.58 (-0.13,+0.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.62 (-0.61,+0.28),
the peak energy Ep = 237 (-27,+27) keV,
chi2 = 105/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate (measured from T0 to T0+6.912 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.40 (-0.11,+0.12),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.70 (-0.84,+0.29),
the peak energy Ep = 214 (-24,+30) keV,
chi2 = 120/97 dof.
