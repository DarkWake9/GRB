TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  19055
SUBJECT: LVC GW 150914: TAROT/TZAC Final analysis correction
DATE:    16/02/22 16:48:20 GMT
FROM:    Michel Boer at CESR-CNRS  <michel.boer@unice.fr>

An error was introduced in the last circular on the absolute magnitude 
corresponding to our observations of GW 150914. The absolute magnitude 
limit is -19.6.
Below the corrected circular:

A. Klotz (IRAP, CNRS/UPS), and M. Boer (ARTEMIS, CNRS/OCA/UNS) report on 
behalf of the TZAC collaboration:

We have reduced and analysed the whole set of images acquired from 
TAROT-Chile (see LV GCN 18348, 18332 for the field coordinates and 
observing log). Depending on the field, the final limits are between R 
 >18.5 and 19.8. If we take a conservative limit of R> 18.5 at 2.8 days 
after the GW event, this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -19.6 
at the distance of GW 150914.
