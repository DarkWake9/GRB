WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 201203A (Dichiara et al.,
GCN 28985) starting at 06:54:43 UT, 136 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. We do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within
the BAT position error circle (Dichiara et al., GCN 28985),
neither in single image, nor in the co-add images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
18.0 mag calibrated to the USNOB1.0 catalog.
Our observation is consistent with the non-detection reported by
other groups (Jelinek et al, GCN 28986; Watson et al., GCN 28987). ï»¿
