Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 171115A (trigger #790053)
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN Circ. 22124).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 278.392, 9.118 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  18h 33m 34.2s
  Dec(J2000) = +09d 07' 06.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~T-7 s,
peaks at ~T-1 s, and ends at ~T+35 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 38.2 +- 3.4 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.38 to T+34.78 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.76 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.9 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-2.32 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
