P. Minaev, A. Pozanenko, I. Chelovekov, S. Grebenev (IKI) report on 
behalf of IKI GRB FuN:

We report observations of GRB 210619B with the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS detector 
(publicly available data). The burst was previously detected in several 
X-/gamma-ray experiments (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 30261; Axelsson et al., 
GCN 30270; Poolakkil et al., GCN 30279; Levin et al., GCN 30283; 
Kawakubo et al., GCN 30284).
GRB 210619B  was detected by SPI-ACS at (UTC) 2021-06-19T23:59:25. Its 
duration in the SPI-ACS energy band (> 80 keV) is T_90 = 50.9 Â± 0.1 s. 
Comparing the fluxes measured from a number of long-duration GRBs 
simultaneously recorded by SPI-ACS and Fermi/GBM (Chelovekov et al., in 
preparation) we estimated the GRB 210619B fluence  to be 1.7e-4 erg/cm^2 
in the 10-1000 keV band (the 95% confidence region which includes 
systematics was 4.9e-5 - 5.9e-4 erg/cm^2). We did not detect any 
precursor with durations of 0.1 - 5 s during 500 s prior to the trigger 
time. Also we did not detect any signature of an extended emission up to 
1000 s after the trigger time. The SPI-ACS light curve of GRB 210619B
