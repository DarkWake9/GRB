Stefano Sposetti (Gnosca, Switzerland) reports to the AAVSO International 
High Energy Network the following optical observations of GRB080205 (GCN 
#7250, Markwardt et al.):

Stefano Sposetti reports an upper limit on the optical afterglow of 
GRB080205 reported by Li et al (GCN #7251).  The reported afterglow 
position was observed for a total of 7200 seconds using a 0.4-meter 
Newtonian with an SBIG ST8XE CCD and no filter.  Observations commenced on 
2008 February 05.74, approximately 9.5 hours after the Swift-BAT 
detection.  The afterglow was not detected, and an upper limit of CR=21.0 
was obtained with a S/N of 3, using USNO A2.0 magnitudes as comparisons. 
This upper limit is consistent with the R < 20 upper limit by Terra et al. 
(GCN #7260) at 2008 February 05.94, and the R = 23.5 detection at 2008 Feb 
05.96 by Rol et al. (GCN #7258).
