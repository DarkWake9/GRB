 U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:
 We imaged the field of GRB 120116A detected
 by SWIFT(trigger 511866) with the robotic
 telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano
 Observatory, Italy.

 The observations started 3min 41sec. after the 
 GRB trigger,with our Schmidt telescope 
 D=320 mm F/D=3.1.

 Weather conditions were discrete.

 We co-added a series of 15 exposures of 120sec. 
 
 We did not found any optical counterpart  
 in the error box of the XRTcandidate 
 (Melandri et al, GCN Circ 12834).
