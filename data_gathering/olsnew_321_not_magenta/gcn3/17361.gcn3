W. Fong (U. Arizona) reports:

"We observed the field of the possibly-short GRB 150120A (D'Elia et al.,
GCN 17310) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2015
Jan 21.027 UT (21.7 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz. In 70
min of observations, we do not detect any radio source within or around the
enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 17317). In addition, we do not
detect any radio source within or near the position of the possible AMI
source at 15 GHz (Anderson et al., GCN 17350). We therefore place a 3-sigma
limit of ~30 microJy on the 9.8 GHz radio afterglow of GRB 150120A at 21.7
hr after the burst.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
