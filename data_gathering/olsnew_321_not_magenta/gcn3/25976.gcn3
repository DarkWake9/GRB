D. Svinkin reports on behalf of the Konus-Wind team:

The redshift of GRB 191004B mentioned in GCN 25974 was incorrect,
the correct one is z = 3.503 (D'Elia et al., GCN circ. 25956).

Thus, assuming the redshift z=3.503 and a standard cosmology model with
H_0 = 67.3 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.315, and Omega_Lambda = 0.685
(Planck Collaboration, 2014),
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters:
the isotropic energy release E_iso is 1.08(-0.10,+0.12)x10^53 erg,
the peak luminosity L_iso is 3.01(-0.86,+0.87)x10^53 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy of the time-integrated spectrum,
Ep,i, is 775(-95,+122) keV.
With these energetics, the burst lies within the 68% prediction bands
for both 'Amati' and 'Yonetoku' relations built for the sample
of 138 long KW GRBs with known redshifts
(Tsvetkova et al., ApJ 850 161, 2017).

I apologize for possible inconvenience.
