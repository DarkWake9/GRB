(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150711A (Bernardini et al. GCN 18011) with 
the 40 cm telescope of Burakan-ISON observatory starting on Jul., 11 
(UT) 18:36:16, i.e. ~13 min after burst trigger. We obtained several 
unfiltered images. In a combined image we  do not detect any source 
within the XRT error box (Osborne et al. GCN 18012) down to a limiting 
magnitude of R = 16.9
