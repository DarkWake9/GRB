TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1815
SUBJECT: Distribution of INTEGRAL SPI-ACS triggers for GRB bursts
DATE:    03/01/15 17:18:01 GMT
FROM:    INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>

The ISDC Shift Team and the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB Team report:

This circular concerns GRBs detected in the  SPI-ACS data . It is
complementary to GCN circular 1813 dealing with GRBs
detected in the field of view of  INTEGRAL.

A new procedure for the distribution of INTEGRAL SPI-ACS triggers has
been decided during the INTEGRAL-IBAS meeting on 2003 Jan, 14:

The automatic alert generation is foreseen to start in the next weeks .
Until then:
- no trigger information will be distributed via the GCN circulars;
- the lightcurves and the spacecraft ephemeris data for all SPI-ACS triggers are
    available at the public ftp area of the ISDC:
ftp://isdcarc.unige.ch/arc/FTP/ibas/spiacs
- a summary list of SPI-ACS triggers summarizing only those triggers with (probable)
   burst origin can be found at:
   http://www.mpe.mpg.de/gamma/instruments/integral/spi/acs/grb/tab.html

A new GCN circular will inform about the procedure after switch on of the automatic
GRB alert generation for the SPI-ACS data.
