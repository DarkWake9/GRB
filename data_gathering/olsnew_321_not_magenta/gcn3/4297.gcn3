  The GRB 051008 prompt emission (Swift-BAT trigger #158855; 
Marshall et al., GCN 4069, Parsons et al., GCN 4075, Barthelmy et al.,
GCN 4077) triggered Suzaku Wideband All-sky Monitor (WAM), 
which covers an energy band of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 16:33:18 UT. 

The light curve shows two peaks with total duration about 48.2 sec. 
This is consistent with Swift observation (GCN4069). 

We performed the time-averaged spectral analysis 
using the position information provided by Swift (Marshall et al., GCN 4069). 
We found that the emission extends up to at least 2 MeV. 
The cutoff power law model provided a good fit. 
In the preliminary results, the photon index was 1.24 (+0.13 -0.15) 
and the cutoff energy was 1535 (+1419 -561) keV.  
The peak flux on 1 sec time scale was 4.1 (+0.3 -0.3) photons/s/cm^2 
(100 keV - 2 MeV) and the fluence was 3.2 (+0.2 -0.2)e-5 erg/cm^2
(100 keV - 2 MeV). The errors are at the statistical 90 % confidence level.
Systematic errors, such as the flux calibration uncertainties of
about 20%, are not included in the errors.

Further analysis and the refinement is in progress.
