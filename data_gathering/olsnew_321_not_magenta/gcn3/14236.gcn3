V.Chaplin (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:15:21.42 UT on 16 Feb 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130216A (trigger 382745724 / 130216927),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Melandri et al. 2013, GCN 14223).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two peaks at T0 and T0+4 s,
with a duration (T90) of about 7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0 s to T0+6.7 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 152 +/- 13 keV,
alpha = -0.7 +/- 0.1, and beta = -2.6 +/- 0.3.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.231 +/- 0.255)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.5 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 9.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
