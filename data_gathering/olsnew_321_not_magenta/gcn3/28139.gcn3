The bright GRB 200716C (Swift detection: Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 28124,
Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 28136; Fermi-LAT detection: Ohno et al.,
GCN Circ. 28130; Fermi GBM detection: Veres and Meegan, GCN Circ. 28135;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200716C.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:57:41.346 UTC on 16 July 2020.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows two narrow pulses followed by a weak tail. The
emission starts at T-0.1 sec and ends at T+6.8 sec. The T90 and T50
durations measured by the SGM data are 5.3 +- 1.1 sec and 1.9 +- 0.1 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
