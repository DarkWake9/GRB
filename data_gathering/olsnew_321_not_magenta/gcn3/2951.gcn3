TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2951
SUBJECT: GRB050117: Swift XRT Position
DATE:    05/01/17 13:42:00 GMT
FROM:    David Burrows at PSU/Swift  <burrows@astro.psu.edu>

D. N. Burrows, J. E. Hill,  G. Chincarini, J. Nousek, N. Gehrels, and P. Schady
report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT reported a prompt position for GRB050117.  The burst was
discovered by the BAT and the Swift spacecraft performed a prompt slew.   The
XRT found a bright source in the field and imaged it at
IMG_START_DATE:  13387 TJD;    17 DOY;   05/01/17
IMG_START_TIME:  46548.64 SOD {12:55:48.64} UT

The XRT position is
GRB_RA:          358.4644d {+23h 53m 51s} (J2000),
                 358.5274d {+23h 54m 07s} (current),
                 357.8439d {+23h 51m 23s} (1950)
GRB_DEC:         +65.9418d {+65d 56' 30"} (J2000),
                 +65.9699d {+65d 58' 12"} (current),
                 +65.6635d {+65d 39' 49"} (1950)

The XRT positions are not yet fully calibrated, and we estimate an uncertainty
of 30 arcseconds in these coordinates.  The XRT prompt image confirms that a
point source is located at this position.  A check of SIMBAD shows no bright
X-ray sources in this location.  Further information, including an XRT
lightcurve and spectrum, will be available in a few hours.
