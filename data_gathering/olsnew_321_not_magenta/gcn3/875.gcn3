V. Mohan, Ram Sagar, S.B. Pandey (UPSO, Nainital), and
A. J. Castro-Tirado, IAA-CSIC (Granada) and  LAEFF-INTA (Madrid),  
on behalf of a larger collaboration,

report:

"We have imaged 90% of the error box for GRB 001105 (Hurley et al., 
GCN 874) with the 1.0-m telescope of U.P. State Observatory, Nainital.
A single R-band frame (300-s exposure time) was obtained on Nov 6.99 UT
(i.e. 31 hours after the GRB).  No new objects are seen within the error
box when comparing to the DSS-2 (R-band), down to a limiting magnitude      
of R = 19.5. Deeper optical/NIR images of this "north galactic pole" 
burst are encouraged."
