J. R. Cummings (CPI) and D. M. Palmer (LANL)
report on behalf of the Swift science team:

At 13:28:38 during a preplanned Swift slew, GRB 150530B caused a rate
increase in Swift-BAT.  Photon event data were collected during the slew.
In ground analysis, we detect a significant source in a mosaic image.
The source was at RA, Dec 7.496, +44.290 which is:

RA (J2000)   00h 29m 59.0s
Dec (J2000) +44d 17' 25"

with an estimated 90% containment radius of 3 arcmin.

In BAT, the burst lasted 2.0 +- 0.4 seconds.  The spectrum was soft, with
no detected excess above 100 keV.

The best fit to the spectrum from 15-150 keV is a simple power law with
a photon index of 1.7 +- 0.2.  The fluence in 2 seconds was
(1.25 +- 0.2) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.  The uncertainties quoted are estimated
90% confidence.
