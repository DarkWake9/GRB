S. Gupta, V. Sharma, A. Vibhute and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:
Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of the long GRB 200306A, which was also detected by Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov V. et al., GCN #27319), Swift (Simpson K. et al., GCN #27320) and Potential LCO (Strausbaugh R. et al., GCN #27321).
The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-03-06 00:19:55.46 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 323 +/- 20.4 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 5603 +/- 41.2 cts. The local mean background count rate was 525 +/- 0.9 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 33.7 +/- 0.07 s.
CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site atÂ http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb.
CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
