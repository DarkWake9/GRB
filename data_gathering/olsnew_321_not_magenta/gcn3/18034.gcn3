Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of
BAT GRB 150716A (trigger #649157) (Kocevski, et al.,
GCN Circ. 18027). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 278.481, -12.978 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 33m 55.4s
   Dec(J2000) = -12d 58' 40.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 91%.

BAT light curve shows a single peak starting around T+5 sec
and ending around T+60 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is
44 +- 6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.19 to T+50.02 sec is
best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.54 +- 0.10.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+9.69 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted
errors are at the 90% confidence level.
