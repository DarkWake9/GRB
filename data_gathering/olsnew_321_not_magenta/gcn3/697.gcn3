D. A. Frail (NRAO), K. M. Becker (Oberlin), E. Berger, A. H. Diercks
and J. S. Bloom (Caltech) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA
GRB collaboration:
 
"We have observed the error box of GRB000607 (GCN #693) with the VLA
at 1.43 and 4.86 GHz on three occasions: May 8.59, May 8.79, and May
9.79. Within this error box there are three previously known radio
sources, cataloged by the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) in 1993 (see
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jcondon/nvss.html). We see no evidence for
significant flux variability for any of these sources over our
observing time. No new radio sources were detected in the error box to
typical levels of 0.5 mJy (4.5-sigma) at 1.43 GHz and 0.37 mJy
(5-sigma) at 4.86 GHz."
