V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya and V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed clear detection of GRB161129A (Swift BAT detection: S. Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 20210) in the 40-200 keV energy 
range. The light curve shows multiple peak structure at 07:12:06.0 UT, after 27 secs of the Swift Trigger. The measured peak count rate is 170.205 counts/sec 
above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 2160.0 counts. The local mean background count rate was 377.79 counts/sec. Using 
cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 34.06 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb.  CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes
across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
