report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:37:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an excess (trigger=324112).  Swift slewed immediately to the position. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 280.549, -11.450 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 42m 12s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 27' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This position is consistent with the known
transient SWIFT J1842.5-1124 (Krimm et al. ATEL #1610).  The XRT position
is consistent with the previously reported position to within 4.6 arcsec. 
Thus, this trigger is the known source and not a GRB. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (racusin AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
