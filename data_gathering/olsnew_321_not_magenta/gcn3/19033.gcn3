P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne and A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 4686 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 8 UVOT images, we find
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment
and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec =
259.86518, -18.12401 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  17 19 27.64
Dec (J2000): -18 07 26.5

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
