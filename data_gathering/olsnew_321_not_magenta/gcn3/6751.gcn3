M.M. Chester (PSU) and F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift UVOT team:

We have identified an additional exposure of GRB 070809 made by the 
Swift/UVOT that covers the XRT error circle, and can now provide an
optical upper limit at a much earlier time, 74 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  In addition, an error in the photometry analysis previously 
reported (Chester et al., GCN Circ. 6744) has been identified, and 
corrected upper limits are reported below.
