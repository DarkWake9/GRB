MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in South Africa (South African Astronomical 
Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB200107.81 (trigger No 948219,07h 
08m 15.74s , -83d 42m 56.5s, R=0.05) errorbox  18 sec after notice time 
and 69 sec after trigger time at 2020-01-07 19:27:38 UT, with upper limit 
up to  17.7 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 54 deg. The 
sun  altitude  is -18.0 deg.

We detect a new optical transient at a position 
Ra=07h 07m 37.58s
Dec= -83° 43' 07.0"
Mag=17.2
