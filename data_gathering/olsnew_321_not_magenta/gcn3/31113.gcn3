James DeLaunay (UAlabama), Aaron Tohuvavohu (U Toronto), Gayathri
Raman (PSU), Jamie A. Kennea (PSU), report:

Swift/BAT did not successfully trigger on GRB 211124A (T0:
2021-11-24T02:29:53.5 UTC, Fermi/GBM #659413798).

The Fermi/GBM notice, distributed in near real-time, triggered the
Swift Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray Urgent Archiver for
Novel Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, ApJ, 900, 1).

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 200 seconds of BAT event-mode data from
[-50,+150] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested
event mode data was delivered to the ground.

The BAT likelihood search, NITRATES (DeLaunay + Tohuvavohu,
arXiv:2111.01769), detects the burst with a sqrt(TS) of 10.4 in a
0.512 s analysis time bin.
The estimated T90 in the detector is 0.4 +/- 0.2 s (15-350 keV).

NITRATES results are consistent with a burst coming from outside the
coded FOV, with DeltaLLHOut of 5.
An out of FOV origin is consistent with the Fermi/GBM localization.

See Section 9.1 and Figure 20 in the NITRATES paper for brief
descriptions and interpretation of sqrt(TS), DeltaLLHPeak, and
DeltaLLHOut.

GUANO is a fully autonomous, extremely low latency, spacecraft
commanding pipeline designed for targeted recovery of BAT event mode
data around the times of compelling astrophysical events to enable
more sensitive GRB searches.
