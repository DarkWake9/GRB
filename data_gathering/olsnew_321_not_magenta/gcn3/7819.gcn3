A. Cucchiara and D. B. Fox  (Penn State) report:

Based on updated calibration files we re-analyzed the GRB080604 spectrum
taken at HET (GCN 7805). The features reported in the previous GCN are no
longer significant at a 3-sigma confidence level.
Furthermore, only an upper limit of z < 2.8 can be derived from our dataset.

Our revised results are consistent with the results from Gemini-North 
spectroscopy
(Wiersama et al., GCN 7818).  The low signal to noise of our spectrum 
does not
permit detection of the absorption features associated with the z=1.416 
system
seen in those data.
