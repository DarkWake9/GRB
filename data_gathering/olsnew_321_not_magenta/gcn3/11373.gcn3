Veli-Pekka Hentunen, Markku Nissinen and Tuomo Salmi (Taurus Hill
Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

GRAS06 (Global-Rent-a-Scope, Moorook, Australia) RCOS-16 telescope 
and SBIG STL-1001E CCD camera were used to detect GRB 101024A 
optical afterglow. The observations were started at 2010-10-24 11:58:06 (UT) 
and stopped at 2010-10-24 12:30:00 (UT). Three unfiltered observations
with 600s exposure times were made. The afterglow was detected at
following position RA 04 26 01.43 and DEC -77 15 55.9 consistent those
given by Evans P.A. et al. (GCN 11370) to within positional errors.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using 
NOMAD1 0127-0023968 (V = 16.94) as the comparison:

Tmid(s) + T0    Filter            Exp (sec)    Mag      Mag err   Limit
