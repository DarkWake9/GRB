At 12:40:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071011 (trigger=293924).  Swift did not execute an immediate slew
because of an Earth-observing constraint, but it will at ~T+2700 sec. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 8.400, +61.072 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 33m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 04' 21"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows two peaks each of
~10 sec duration.  The second peak is at ~T+48 sec. 
The peak count rate was ~1800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec
after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT data products
to analyze.  The UVOT is currently in safe and will not observe this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
