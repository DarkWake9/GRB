V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), A.Pozanenko (IKI), K. Hurley (UCBerkeley) on behalf of
large collaboration report:

We have imaged the error box of GRB 030425 reported by K.Hurley at al. (IPN
643, GCN 2173) with the AT-64 telescope of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory
(FOV =53x35 arcminutes).

46 x 120 sec unfiltered images cover   ~75% of  the error box. The images
were obtained  between Apr. 26 UT 18:28:33.94 and 27 UT 01:33:05.92, i.e.,
in 26.66 - 33.75 hrs after burst. The limiting magnitude (3 sigma) is about
19.5 for all images. Visual comparison with the DSS reveals no optical
transient.  (The coverage  figure can be found in
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB030425. All frames marked in the figure were obtained
from 2  to 5 times in different epochs.)

Detailed comparison of the images is underway.
