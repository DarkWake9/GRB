on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:10:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 171103A (trigger=785850).  Swift did not slew due to an 
observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 249.536, -10.215 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 38m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 12' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of less than 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~20000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 11:32 UT on 2018 January 15. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
