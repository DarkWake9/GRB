Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071013 (trigger #294120)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 6907).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 279.501, 33.846 deg  which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 38m 0.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = 33d 50' 46" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 70%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-5 sec,
peaking at ~T+5sec, and ending at ~T+30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 26 +- 1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.9 to T+23.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.60 +- 0.36.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.69 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
