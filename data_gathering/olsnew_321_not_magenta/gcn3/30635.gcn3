The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:15:51 UT on 12 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210812B (trigger 650420156.733782 / 210812011).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 183.7, Dec = 2.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 14m, 2d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 29.0 degrees.
