The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are switched off around the perigee passage, every 2.6
days, to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time
of the LIGO/Virgo trigger G211117 (2017-03-13 22:40:09.59 UTC) the
spacecraft was preparing to the perigee passage between the orbits
number 1792 and 1793, and no scientific instrument data are available
after 2017-03-13T22:25:25.
