D. Malesani (SISSA/ISAS), P. Jakobsson (U. Hertfordshire), J. Fynbo, M. 
Stritzinger (DARK, NBI), and S. Covino (INAF/OABr), report:

We observed the field of GRB 060719 (Stanatikos et al., GCN 5339) with 
the ESO VLT + ISAAC, starting on 2006 Jul 19.4237 UT (3.3 hr after the 
trigger). Images in the Js, H and Ks filters were acquired.

The three objects close to the XRT position reported by Berger & Bonanos 
(GCN 5340) and Fugazza et al. (GCN 5347) are detected in our images. We 
note that object #1 of Fugazza et al. (GCN 5347) is significantly 
outside the revised XRT position (Conciatore et al., GCN 5348), while 
object #2 is still at the border of the 90% error circle.

Object #2 is very red, as observed in KHJ images: it is well detected in 
Ks and barely visible in J. Compared with the R-band measurement (which, 
we caution, was taken at a significantly earlier epoch; GCN 5347), it 
has a color R-K ~ 4.5 +- 0.2. At this stage, we cannot assess, however, 
whether this object is related to the GRB.
