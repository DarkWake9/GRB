M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:49:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130521A (trigger=556344).  Swift could not slew to the
burst due to the Sun constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 87.559, +14.452 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 50m 14s
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 27' 09"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 6 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:50 UT on 2013 August 06. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. Pagani (cp232 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
