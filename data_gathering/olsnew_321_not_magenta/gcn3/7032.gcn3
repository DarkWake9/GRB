Martin Jelínek, Petr Kubánek, Stanislav Vítek, 
Alberto J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada) and 
Lola Sabau-Graziati (INTA Madrid), 
on behalf of the BOOTES collaboration,

report:

"The robotic telescope BOOTES-2 located at Experimental
Station La Mayora (EELM-CSIC) in southern Spain
followed automatically the Swift GRB 071101 (McBreen et
al, GCN 7030). Images were taken starting 56s after the
GRB (23.5s after the GCN notice).

We do not detect any new source within the BAT errorbox
down to our unfiltered, USNO-A2 calibrated magnitude of
17.0 in out 180s exposure.

Note the high extinction in the line of sight
E(B-V)=1.43697 => (Ar=3.43).

In particular, we do not see any object at the position
of the galaxy mentioned by Ofek (GCN 7031)."
