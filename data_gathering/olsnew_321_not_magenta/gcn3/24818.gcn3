SUBJECT: GRB 190613B: KAIT Optical Afterglow Confirmation

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 190613B (D'Ai et al.
GCN 24807) starting at 2311s after the burst. Observations were
performed with a sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters,
and the exposure time was 20 s per image. We detected the optical
afterglow at the reported Swift/UVOT position (D'Ai et al., GCN 24798;
Marshall & D'Ai, GCN 24817) in clear band image. We estimate the
clear band magnitude to be ~19.3 at 2321s after the burst.
