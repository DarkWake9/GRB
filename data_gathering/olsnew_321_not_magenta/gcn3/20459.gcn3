Further to our Pan-STARRS campaign (Smartt et al, GCN 20410) and
classification of transients (Chambers et al. GCN 20437) we report
spectra of two further objects at the cores of galaxies.

--------------------------------------------------------------
PS17fr - possible luminous nuclear SN or TDE
---------------------------------------------------------------

PS17fr was discovered coincident with the nucleus of an r=18.36 galaxy
(SDSS J081152.10+252521.3), with a photometric redshift z=0.199.  The
magnitude on the first epoch MJD=57758.433 (from the difference image)
was i=19.2, rising 0.6 mag in 3 days.

A spectrum with the UH2.2m + SNIFS (R~1300, 3200-10000A) was taken on
MJD=57997 and shows broad H-alpha, H-beta and He I 5876. The line
profiles are asymmetric. The strong H-alpha has a width at half
maximum of 5200 km/s, but is either multicomponent or significantly
asymmetric with a red excess. Assuming the centroid of the peak
velocity is representative of the host and transient, then 
z = 0.1862 +/- 0.0003.

This implies an absolute magnitude of M_r = -21.1. The object may be a
a superluminous supernova of type II or IIn.  We note that it is
within the volume defined by the LALInference 3D map, at a luminosity
distance of 918 Mpc (Ho=69, Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lam=0.7). 

As this is a nuclear transient, AGN activity is possible. But we see
no strong [N II], [OIII] or [O II]. A weak feature close to, but not
exactly at the expected position of [O III] 5007 is visible in the
SNIFS data. Another spectrum is required to confirm. 
A tidal disruption event is also a possible explanation.

In summary this is an unusually luminous transient within the LIGO
skymap and at a distance consistent with the central 80% of the
probability distribution. Further multi-wavelength follow-up is
encouraged to determine its nature.

-------------------------------------------------------------
PS17er - probable AGN/Seyfert 2 variability
-------------------------------------------------------------

PS17er is also a rising transient (now at i=20) at the core of the
r=19.2 galaxy SDSS J084157.26+405507.6. A spectrum with Gemini-N+GMOS
(R400 grating, 4491-8778 A) on 57764.4223666319 shows it to be at a
redshift of z=0.4064 from the [O III] 4959/5007 Angs, implying M_g =
-21.3.  These lines have a resolved width of 700 km/s, and there is a
broader (4000 km/s) H-beta line in emission. 

The ratio Log([OIII]/Hb) ~ 0.8, is normal for an AGN.  In Pan-STARRS
regular survey mode, we have seen various detections of i ~ 20
variability. Hence we consider this as likely ongoing Seyfert 2
activity, similar to episodes previously detected in PSST (Huber et
al. 2015, ATel 7153).
