E. A. Hoversten (PSU) and T. Sakamoto (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of  
the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 090915
44647 s after the BAT trigger (Cummings & Markwardt, GCN Circ. 9912).
A faint source is detected with 5.6-sigma confidence in the summed
UVOT observations at the position RA, Dec (J2000) = 238.02016,15.48772
which is equivalent to:

      RA (J2000) = 15:52:04.84
     Dec (J2000) = 15:29:15.8

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
This position is 0.2 arcsec from the UVOT-enhanced XRT position
(Beardmore, et al. GCN Circ. 9914) and the two positions agree within
the error bars.  It is unclear at this point if the source is fading,
but follow-up Swift observations are being planned.

The observed magnitudes using the UVOT photometric system (Poole et
al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) for the initial exposures are:

The values quoted above are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
