Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 181003A (trigger #865179)
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 23295).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 52.481, -33.991 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  03h 29m 55.4s
  Dec(J2000) = -33d 59' 25.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak structure that starts at ~T-10 s
and ends at ~ T+20 s. The burst went out of the BAT field of view at ~T+97 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 21.5 +- 4.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.20 to T+18.01 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index -0.20 +- 1.12,
and Epeak of 56.5 +- 14.4 keV (chi squared 52.40 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.2 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+1.86 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.54 +- 0.19 (chi squared 63.13 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
