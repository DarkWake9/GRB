of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short-duration hard-spectrum GRB 120830A
(Fermi-LAT detection: Vianello et al., GCN 13704;
IPN localization: Hurley at al., GCN 13705)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=25623.562s UT (07:07:03.562)

The light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~0.9 s.
The emission 2is seen up to ~5 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120830_T25623/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 4.8(-0.7,+1.1)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.080 s,
of 1.6(-0.5,+0.5)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 6 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = 0.25 (-0.35, +0.45),
and Ep = 1070(-200, +240) keV,
chi2 = 27/22 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
