D. A. Kann (Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg) and S. Manohar (USC, 
Los Angeles), report:

We observed the field of GRB 060109 (Pasquale et al., GCN 4455) with the 
Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope under good observing conditions. We 
obtained 11 x 600 sec images in the Rc filter for a total integration time 
of 110 minutes. The mean observation time was June 27.9920 UT, which is 
168.2 days after the burst. We determine the zero point of the image in 
comparison with nine unsaturated and isolated stars of the USNOB1.0 
catalog. Astrometry is also performed against the USNOB1.0 catalog.

At the refined position of the X-ray afterglow (Beardmore et al., GCN 
4462), we do not detect any sources. The 2 sigma limiting magnitude of the 
image is Rc=23.5. This magnitude is not corrected for the moderate 
foreground extinction, E(B-V)=0.144.
