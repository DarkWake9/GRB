TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  25909
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S190924h: Correction to GCN 25905, updated sky localization for S190924h
DATE:    19/10/01 19:32:24 GMT
FROM:    Geoffrey Mo at LIGO  <geoffrey.mo@ligo.org>

What follows is the exact content of GCN 25905, which is being re-sent with
a corrected subject. The original subject stated that this was an updated sky
localization for S190828j, which was in error. Instead, this is the updated sky
localization for S190924h.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and Virgo Observatory
(V1) around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S190924h
(GCN Circular 25829). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via
GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190924h

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. The 90%
credible region is 303 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 548 +/- 112 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this
alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide <
