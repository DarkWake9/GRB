A. Corsi (TTU), M.M. Kasliwal (Caltech), D. Frail (NRAO), and N.T. Palliyaguru (TTU) report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of SSS17a/DLT17ck (e.g., Coulter et al. LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al. LVC GCN 21530; 
Yang et al. LVC GCN 21531), the possible counterpart of G298048 (LVC, LVC GCN 21505) in NGC 4993, with the 
Karl G. Jansky VLA. The observation lasted 1 hr, centered on 2017-Aug-22.88 UT, and was conducted in C-band 
(approximate central frequency of 6 GHz). Our preliminary analysis does not show evidence for significant 
emission at the location of the optical candidate SSS17a/DLT17ck, down to a 3-sigma limit of about 20 uJy. 
Further observations are planned.
