and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 161004B (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 19987; Kumar et al.,
GCN Circ. 19996;  Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 19998; INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7590)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:07:52.64 on 4 October 2016.
The burst signal was seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak starting at T0, peaking at
T+7 sec and ending at T+15 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data
is 11.1 +- 0.9 sec (40-450 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
