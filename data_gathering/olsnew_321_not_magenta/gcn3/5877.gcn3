Uthas (NOT), report:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 061121 (Page et al., GCN 5823) at 
several epochs with NOT + ALFOSC. Starting from 2006 Nov. 25 on, the 
R-band light curve significantly flattened with respect to earlier 
observations (e.g. Halpern et al., GCN 5847; Efimov et al., GCN 5870). 
This is likely due to the presence of a relatively bright underlying 
host galaxy. Some hints of extension are seen in our images taken during 
the night of Nov 27, with a seeing of 0.9".
