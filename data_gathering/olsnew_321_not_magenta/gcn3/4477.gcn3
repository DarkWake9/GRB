Using the data set from T-299.7 to T+95 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060110
(trigger #176702)  (Zane, et al., GCN 4463).  
The BAT ground-calculated position
is (RA,Dec) = 72.738, 28.427 {4h 50m 57.2s, 28d 25' 35.7"} (deg; J2000)
+- 0.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 92%.
 
The mask-tagged lightcurve shows a single FRED like peak starting from 
T-2 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is (17 +- 2) sec 
(estimated error including systematics).
Due to viewing constraints, Swift slewed away from this burst after
95 seconds, so no information on any possible later emission is
available.  There is no sign of emission after the single FRED peak,
however.

Over the full burst interval (T-3.7 to T+20.4 sec), 
the power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.63 +- 0.08.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (1.4 +- 0.1) x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.22 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is (1.9 +- 0.2) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
