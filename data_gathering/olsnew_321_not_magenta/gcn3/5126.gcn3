We have observed the afterglow (Cummings et al, GCN 5117; Mundell and
Steele, GCN 5118; Malesani et al., GCN 5122; Cenko, GCN 5125) of GRB
060512, a  bright burst localized by Swift BAT (Cummings et al., GCNs
5117, 5124), beginning at about 5:36 UT on 13 May 2006 (about 6.4 hours
after the burst) under partly cloudy conditions, using NIC-FPS on the
ARC 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory.  The observation
consisted of a series of 15 20-second exposures in Ks.  From them, we
have constructed a stacked image of the GRB field, corresponding to a
5-minute exposure.

We measure a magnitude for the afterglow of Ks = 17.7 +/-0.2.  Further 
observations are underway.

NIC-FPS is currently in its commissioning phase.
