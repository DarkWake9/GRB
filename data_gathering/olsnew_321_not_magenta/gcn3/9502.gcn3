Following the Fermi GBM/Konus/Swift detection of bursts from the new 
Soft Gamma
Repeater SGR 0418+5729 (van der Horst et al. 2009, GCN #9499) we 
triggered our
SGR ToO Program with RXTE. A 6.8 ks RXTE observation started on 2009 
June 10,
03:42:56 UT. We detect a strong, coherent pulsations from the new SGR 
(2-10 keV)
in the PCA GoodXenon mode data at 0.110152(2) Hz, corresponding to a 
spin period
of 9.0783(1) sec. The pulse morphology is complex showing two asymmetric 
maxima
per cycle.  We note that there is no previously known X-ray source in 
the RXTE field
of view with such periodicity. The detected coherent pulsations likely 
indicate the spin
period of the newly discovered, burst-active SGR. 
We thank the project scientist Jean Swank, and the RXTE planner, Divya 
Pereira for
the prompt scheduling of the RXTE observations.
