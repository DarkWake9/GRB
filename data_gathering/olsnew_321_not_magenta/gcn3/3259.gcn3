M. Nysewander, D. Reichart, J. A. Crain report on behalf of the UNC team of
the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the BAT localization of GRB 050412 (Cummings et al., GCN 3237)
with PROMPT beginning 5m 50s after the burst.

We do not detect a source within the XRT localization (Tamburelli et al.,
GCN 3241; Mangano et al. GCN 3253) nor the source identified by Jensen et
al. (GCN 3243).

3-sigma limiting magnitudes are based on 10 USNO-B1.0 stars for Rc and Ic
observations, and 10 NOMAD stars for V observations:

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
