The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 12 July 2019 at 01:15:17.38 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The threshold astrophysical neutrino purity for  Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 2.6 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/132814_44222682.amon ), more  
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 19/07/12
Time:  01:15:17.38 UT
RA: 76.46 (+5.09 -6.83 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 13.06 (+4.48 -3.44 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We recognize this event has somewhat larger direction uncertainty compared to the originally reported values.   This is likely due to the shorter than usual track length through the instrumented volume. 

The nearest Fermi 4FGL catalog source is 4FGL J0502.5+1340, located 1.01 degrees from the best-fit location.  Given the size of the 90% containment region, there are several other 4FGL and 3FHL sources in the 90% uncertainty region. 

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
