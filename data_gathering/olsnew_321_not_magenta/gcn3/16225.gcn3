the Fermi GBM team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration, very intense GRB 140508A (Yu and Goldstein, GCN Circ.
16224) has been observed by Fermi (GBM), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), 
Swift (BAT), and MESSENGER (GRNS) so far, at about 11035 s UT 
(03:03:55). The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   255.631 (17h 02m 31s) +46.747 (+46d 44' 51")
  Corners:
   254.602 (16h 58m 24s) +47.063 (+47d 03' 48")
   256.275 (17h 05m 06s) +46.717 (+46d 43' 00")
   256.649 (17h 06m 36s) +46.418 (+46d 25' 06")
   254.988 (16h 59m 57s) +46.773 (+46d 46' 23")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 882 sq. arcmin, and its maximum dimension is 1.5
deg (the minimum one is 12 arcmin). The Sun distance was about 110 deg.

This box can be improved.

Details of the K-W observation will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular
