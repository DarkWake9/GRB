We observed the Swift GRB 110213A (D'Elia et al., GCN 11705)
afterglow with the Lightbuckets 0.61m rental telescope LB-0001
in Rodeo, NM, USA. Under good weather conditions, four
observations were carried out in the R filter starting
2011-02-13 at 05:33:14 UT (~ 15.7 mins after the GRB trigger).

The burst afterglow is clearly detected in all four
observations and estimated magnitudes are given below:

Time after trigger       Exposure (s)   Filter     Magnitude

15.7  mins (0.26 hours)     60              R      15.4 +/- 0.1
17.8  mins (0.30 hours)     60              R      15.5 +/- 0.1
19.9  mins (0.33 hours)     60              R      15.5 +/- 0.1
22.6  mins (0.38 hours)     60              R      15.7 +/- 0.1

The afterglow, not corrected for Galactic extinction, is
calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 catalog.
