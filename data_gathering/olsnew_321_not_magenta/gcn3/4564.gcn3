The GRB 060121 (=H4010; Arimoto et al., GCN 4550;
Prigozhin et al., GCN 4551)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=80700.890 s UT (22:25:00.890).

The Konus-Wind light curve shows a single pulse with
a duration of ~2 sec.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had
a fluence of 4.71(-3.71,+0.44)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and
peak flux measured from T0+0.448 sec on 64 msec time scale
1.64(-1.32,+0.18)x10^-5 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 
1 MeV range) by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.51(-0.60,+0.55),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.39(-1.41,+0.27),
the break energy E0 = 70(-52, +90) keV (chi2 = 59/59 dof).
The fitting by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
in the same energy range gives
alpha = 0.82(-0.21,+0.38)
and Ep = 134(-17, +32) keV (chi2 = 63/60 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
