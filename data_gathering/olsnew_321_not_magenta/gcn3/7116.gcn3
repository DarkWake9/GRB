  M. De Pasquale, P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) and J. Cummings (GSFC/GWU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

  The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 071118 (Cummings
et al, GCN 7106) 123s after the BAT trigger.

  In the v band finding chart, an uncatalogued source is detected
inside the refined XRT error circle (Moretti et al 7111) with ~6
sigma significance. This source looks extended; however it is not
found at late times, which indicates that it is the optical
afterglow of GRB 071118. Its detection suggests that this GRB
took place at redshift z<~5. The coordinates of this source are

  RA:    19 58 51.8
  Dec:  +70 07 29.2

  with an error of 0.6 arcsecond. No new source is detected within
the XRT error circle in the b, u or uv filters, either in the single
or co-added exposures.

  In the table below, we indicate the magnitude of the optical
afterglow and the 3sigma upper limits. We do caution that the
photometry may be affected by the halo of a near bright star and
the crowded field.
