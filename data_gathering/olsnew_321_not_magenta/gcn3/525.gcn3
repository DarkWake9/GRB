K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and T. Cline
and E. Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB
teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR detected a ~100 s long GRB, whose 25-100 keV
fluence was ~10^-5 erg/cm^2, at 84402 s UT on January 26, 2000.  The
burst can only be localized at present to two alternate error boxes,
each ~55 sq. arcmin. in area, whose corners are at:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  6 h 35 m 44.61 s     -8 o 43 '  10.60 "
  6 h 36 m 31.96 s     -8 o 29 '  26.94 "
  6 h 36 m 19.35 s     -8 o 37 '  49.17 "
  6 h 37 m  7.39 s     -8 o 23 '  55.09 "

              OR  
    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  7 h 45 m 40.70 s      7 o 53 '  53.12 "
  7 h 44 m 42.48 s      7 o 43 '   2.86 "
  7 h 45 m 16.97 s      7 o 45 '  38.87 "
  7 h 44 m 18.05 s      7 o 34 '  38.23 "
 
These error boxes can be refined, and there is a slight possibility
that further analysis will make it possible to eliminate one
of them.
