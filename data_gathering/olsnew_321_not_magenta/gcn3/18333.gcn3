MASTER II  twin robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru,
FOV= 2x4 square degrees) located in SAAO was starting survey on the aLIGO
trigger G184098 error-box    220517 sec after trigger time at 2015-09-16
20:18:11 UT. The 5-sigma upper limit on our  sets is about 18.4 mag - 19.9
mag . We observed 212 square degrees  by 3 images for each field during ~2
hours. There are LMC near the center error box and Milky Way at the east
edge of the error box. Because large number of stars the redaction is delay
and continueted. The cover map  is available at

. <http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/master_antares_alert_150901.png>  We
started from the left edge of the error box as its rise. The gap between
green sets is due to meteo restrictions.

This circular is an official product of the MASTER team.
