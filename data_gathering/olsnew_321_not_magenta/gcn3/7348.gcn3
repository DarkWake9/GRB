We have observed the field of GRB 080229 (Cannizzo et al. GCN 7335)
with the 1.5m telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory (OSN, Granada).
The observations were obtained in I-band and range between March
1.1681 and March 1.2638 UT (mean exposure 0.5042 days after the burst).
We do not detect any new source in the error box of Swift/XRT
(Beardmore et al. GCN 7343) down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of
I~22.0.
