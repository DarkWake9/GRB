report:

The short-duration GRB 190903A
(Fermi-GBM detection: Fermi GBM Team, GCN Circ. 25633;
Mailyan and Meegan, GCN Circ. 25636)
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 589223981), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and Konus-Wind, at about 62376 s UT (17:19:36).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    63.950 (04h 15m 48s) -59.485 (-59d 29' 04")
  Corners:
    62.459 (04h 09m 50s) -49.304 (-49d 18' 15")
    66.042 (04h 24m 10s) -66.310 (-66d 18' 34")
    64.926 (04h 19m 42s) -65.995 (-65d 59' 43")
    61.374 (04h 05m 30s) -46.559 (-46d 33' 33")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is about 7.5 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 19.9 deg (the minimum one is 27.5 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 100 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the 
Fermi-GBM one.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
