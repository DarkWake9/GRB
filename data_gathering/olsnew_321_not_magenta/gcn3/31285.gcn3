report on behalf of the Energetic Cosmos Laboratory:

The Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen 
Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO) observed the field of GRB 
211221A 19 s after receipt an automated GCN / BAT position alert, 
observing in Sloan i' band, with the Burst Simultaneous Three-Channel 
Imager (BSTI; Grossan, Kumar & Smoot 2019, JHEA, 32, 14).

We started observations at 20:51:35 UT on 2021-12-21, 175 s after the 
BAT trigger. Observations were made in clear conditions starting at 
about 30 deg. target altitude. No source consistent with the XRT (P. 
Evans et al., GCN Circ. 31275) was detected.  We report the following 
results:

start time    t-t0(s)  end time        ULi'       exposure_time (s)
------------    --------  ------------          ------ --------------------
20:51:35     175   20:52:35          17.9           60
20:52:50     257   22:12:50          18.4         150

start time is in UT. t-t0(s) gives the time since trigger, in seconds. 
UL i', gives the 5 sigma upper limit sensitivity in magnitudes, for 
images co-added to the given exposure time. The first row in the table 
corresponds to co-adds of an initial short exposure image sequence of 
7.5 s. The second row corresponds to co-adds from a continuing series of 
15 s exposures.  Calibration was done with the 3 bright Pan-STARRS 
catalog stars on our images.

We caution the reader that these are preliminary results, without color 
or other corrections. Please also note that times are approximate.
