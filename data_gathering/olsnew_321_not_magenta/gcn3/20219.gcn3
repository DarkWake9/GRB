report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:11:39.96 UT on the 29th of November 2016, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 161129A
(trigger 502096303/161129300), which was also detected by
Swift (Kocevski et al., GCN 20210). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift position. The angle from the Fermi
LAT boresight is 87 degrees using the Swift position.

The GBM light curve shows a bright burst, with multiple peaks
over a duration (T90) of about 36 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+4.8 s to T0+45.7 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.13 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 197 +/- 21 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.4 +/- 0.4)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+26 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 5.6 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
