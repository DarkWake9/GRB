"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060717 (GCN 5326) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 12:07:14 UT on Jul. 17.
After co-adding a set of 11 images (12:07:14 - 12:18:58 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 16.5 mag. "
