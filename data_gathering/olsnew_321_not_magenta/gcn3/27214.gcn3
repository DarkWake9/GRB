The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) data
around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S200219ac
(GCN Circular 27130). Parameter estimation has been performed using
LALInference [1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed
via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200219ac

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 781 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 3533 +/- 1031 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
