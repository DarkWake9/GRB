The long-duration, intense GRB 170101A
(Swift-BAT trigger #729293: Lien  et al., GCN 20349;
Barthelmy et al., GCN 20353;
POLAR observation: Li et al., GCN 20355;
Lomonosov BDRG observation: Bogomolov et al., GCN 20359)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=8757.802 s UT (02:25:57.802).

The burst light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse
with a total duration of ~4 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.35(-0.18,+0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.264 s,
of 1.86(-0.23,+0.24)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+9.472 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.44(-0.13,+0.17),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.49(-0.65,+0.23),
the peak energy Ep = 123(-21,+23) keV,
chi2 = 101/97 dof.

The spectrum near the peak count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+1.280 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.07(-0.15,+0.17),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.48(-0.22,+0.14),
the peak energy Ep = 124(-15,+18) keV,
chi2 = 57/56 dof.
