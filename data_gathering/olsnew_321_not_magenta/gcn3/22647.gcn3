GRB 180418A: KAIT Optical Afterglow Candidate

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 180418A (D'Elia et al.,
GCN 22646 starting at 06:46:41 UT, 125 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. Inside the Swift/BAT position error circle we
detected an afterglow candidate at position:
RA:  11:20:29.20 (j2000)
Dec: 24:55:58.8  (j2000)
The clear band magnitude declined from Mag ~15.8 to ~17.2 during our
observations.
Observation are on going, multi-band follow-ups are encouraged.
