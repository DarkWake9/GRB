D. Xu (DARK/NBI), X. Zhang, C.-H. Bai, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the optical afterglow field of GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al.,
GCN 16142; Elenin et al., GCN 16143; Kaur et al., GCN 16144;) using
the 1m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Three R-band
frames were obtained under rather bad weather. The afterglow has
decayed down to a limiting magnitude of m(R)>19.4 mag at a mean time
of 8.216 hr post-burst, calibrated with nearby SDSS stars.
