We observed a single pointing designed to cover the majority of the sunward-lobe of the  skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger G194575 with the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope.  The observation covers roughly 30deg x 30deg (FWHM) centered at:

13:20:00 -12:42:00  2015-10-23T03:49:19 UT

(see attached image, where the sky probability is plotted logarithmically).  The observations are at a center frequency of 154 MHz, with a 30 MHz bandwidth with 0.5s integrations and 40 kHz frequency resolution.  This field will be reobserved in roughly 2 weeks.  Analysis is ongoing.  [cid:C6D6DF20-687D-498E-BEB4-14C80AF0818A@arizona.edu]
