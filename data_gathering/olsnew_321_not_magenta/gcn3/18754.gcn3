Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151228A (trigger #668543)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 18731).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 214.017, -17.665 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 16m 04.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 39' 52.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T-0.05,
peaking at ~T+0.03, and ending at ~T+0.3.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
0.27 +- 0.01 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.036 to T+0.276 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.85 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.4 +- 1.1 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.38 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
