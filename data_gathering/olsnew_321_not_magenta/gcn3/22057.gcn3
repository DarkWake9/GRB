We observed the field of GRB 171027A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ. 22053)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/10 27.35 to
2017/10 27.37 UTC (0.04 to 0.51 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 0.36 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.15 hours
exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections and upper
limits (3-sigma):

  r	> 23.17
  i	> 23.12
  Z	> 20.66
  Y	> 21.09
  J	= 20.95 +/- 0.26
  H	= 19.12 +/- 0.06

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. The source position is at RA,
Dec (J2000) = 04:06:45.77 -02:37:18.9 (+/- 0.5 arcsec). We currently
have no evidence for fading.

The very red colors suggest that this might be at high redshift or
dusty.

Further observations are planned.
