The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:57:12 UT on 27 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210427A (trigger 641192237.991858 / 210427206).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 177.3, Dec = -53.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 49m, -53d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 146.0 degrees.
