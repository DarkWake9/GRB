Using the data set from T-299 to T+303 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060116 (trigger #177533)
(Compana, et al., GCN 4519).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA,Dec = 84.699,-5.449 deg {5h 38m 47.8s, -5d 26' 56.0"} (J2000) +- 1.7 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 20%.
 
The lightcuve has one peak centered on T+20 sec.  There is very weak emission
starting as early as ~T-40 sec.  The event is over by ~T+90 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is (113 +- 10) sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.44 +- 0.18.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (2.6 +- 0.3) x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+36.08 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is (1.1 +- 0.3) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
