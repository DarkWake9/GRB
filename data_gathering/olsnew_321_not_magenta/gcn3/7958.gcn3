TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 080710: Swift XRT position

B. Sbarufatti (INAF-IASFPA), P. A. Evans (U Leicester)
and V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

The XRT began observing the field at 08:05:22.4 UT, 3131.6 seconds
after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 8.27344, 19.50157 which is
equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 33m 5.63s
   Dec(J2000) = +19d 30' 05.7"
with an uncertainty of 3.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 65 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle.

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value
(4.1e+20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of
2 (+2.03/-1.73) x 1021 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
