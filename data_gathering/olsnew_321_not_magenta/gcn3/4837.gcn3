TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4837
SUBJECT: GRB 060218/SN 2006aj, SMARTS optical/IR observations

B. E. Cobb and C. D. Bailyn (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS
consortium, report:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the position of GRB 060218/SN 2006aj
(GCN 4775, Cusumano et al.) over 5 nights.  Total summed exposure time
on each night amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The object shows continued brightening over our images. The preliminary 
I magnitude of the object on 2006-02-22 is calculated based
on contemporaneous observations of Landolt RU149.  The preliminary J 
magnitude on the same day is calculated in comparison to 2MASS 
stars in the field.
