TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  18535
SUBJECT: Correction to the Trigger Time for Swift GRB 151029A

S. Barthelmy and F. Marshall (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift team:

In GCN Circular 18522, we stated that the trigger time for GRB 151029A 
was 07:49:54 UT, but with the full data set downlinked, the correct trigger time
is 07:49:39 UT.  The correction for the on-board clock drift had not
been applied in the original Circular due to the lack of some of the
real-time TDRSS downlinked data.  We apologise for any inconvenience.
