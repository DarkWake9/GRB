NUMBER:  4937
SUBJECT: GRB 060322: LNA optical limit

A. Pereyra, T. Dominici, A. M. Magalhães and Z. Abraham (IAG, Univ. of São Paulo) report:

We observed the field of GRB 060322 (Perri et al. GCN 4903) with the IAG-USP 60cm 
telescope at the Laboratório Nacional de Astrofísica (LNA), Brazil. The observations 
were made on March 24.342 (UT middle of observation) and 1.381 days after the burst 
under non-optimal sky conditions. Comparison to the DSS2 (Red) did not reveal any object 
inside the error circle from Perri et al. (GCN 4919). Our sequence of co-added R-band 
images (8x300s + 5x50s) yielded a 3-sigma limit magnitude of 18.7 using USNO B1.0 field 
stars.
