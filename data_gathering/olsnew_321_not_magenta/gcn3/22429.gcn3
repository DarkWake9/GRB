The long GRB 180219A (Fermi-GBM trigger #540732857; Konus-Wind trigger
time on 11:34:41.20) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at
11:36:05.118 UTC on 19 February 2018.  CGBM triggered on the second pulse,
~2 min after the Fermi GBM trigger.  The signal of the initial pulse was
significantly attenuated due to the large incident angle.  The burst emission
was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The light curve shows two broad multi-peaked pulses, which started at T+115 sec
and ended at T+2 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data
are 109.5 +- 7.5 sec and 76.9 +- 7.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
