E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories), S.B. Cenko, D. Leonard (Caltech) and
B.E. Penprase (Pomona College) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:
                                                                                  
"We observed the position of the near-IR afterglow candidate of GRB 050126
(Berger et al. astro-ph/0502468) with WIRC on the Palomar 200-inch
telescope on 2005, Feb 28.5 UT.  A total of 30 minutes were obtained in
the Ks band.  We find that the object has faded by at least 1.1 mag
confirming that it is in fact the afterglow.  In addition, a faint source
is detected at the same position which is presumably the host galaxy."
