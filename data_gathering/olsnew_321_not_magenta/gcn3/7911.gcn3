SUBJECT: GRB 080701: Swift-XRT Prompt Analysis

M.C. Stroh, C. Pagani (PSU) and P. Evans (U. Leicester) report on  
behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

The XRT began observing the field at 11:00:14.4 UT, 2796.8 seconds
after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 45.83937, 75.47535 which
is equivalent to:
  RA(J2000)  = 03h 03m 21.45s
  Dec(J2000) = +75d 28' 31.3"
with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 59 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle.

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.78e+21
cm-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 6.3
(+3.88/-3.07) x 10^21 cm-2 (90% confidence).

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
