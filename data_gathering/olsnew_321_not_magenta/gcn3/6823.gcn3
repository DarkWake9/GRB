SUBJECT: GRB 070925: a long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), D.Petry, 
V.Beckmann, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) 
on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A  GRB lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI 
data at 15:52:32 UT of September 25.
The coordinates (J2000)  are:

RA:  253.218 [degrees] 
DEC: -22.0355 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The light curve is affected by gaps due to telemetry saturation. The peak 
flux in the 20-200 keV range is 2 ph/cmq/s (1-s integration time) and the 
fluence over the same energy range is larger than 2x10e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
