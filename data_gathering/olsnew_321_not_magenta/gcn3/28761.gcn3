Swift Observatory Team:

At 02:48:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201024A (trigger=1001514).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 125.948, +3.377 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 23m 47s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 22' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 02:50:14.0 UT, 74.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 125.9521,
3.3537 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 08h 23m 48.50s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 21' 13.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 85 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 3.64
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 6.41e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 495 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	08:23:48.55 = 125.95229
  DEC(J2000) = +03:21:14.5  =	3.35403
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.62 arc sec. This position is 0.7
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
17.85 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.03.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
