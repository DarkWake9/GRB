At 11:55:25.05 UTC (42925.05 s UT) on 5 March 2002, the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments detected a GRB.  The burst, H1939, was promptly
reported as a GCN Alert Notice within 42 seconds of the detection time.
The main part of the burst began at 11:59:04 UTC (43144 s UT), just as
the spacecraft reached the dawn terminator and the WXM high voltage was
turning off.  Accurate aspect was derived for H1939 from a full data
set on the ground. Ground analysis produced a location which can be
expressed as a circle with a 90% confidence radius of 25 arcminutes
centered at

RA = +12h 43m 03s, Dec = -14d 33' 06" (J2000)

This location was reported in a GCN Alert Notice (issued at 5 Mar 2002
21:51:55 UT)

GRB020305 (=H1939) has a duration in the FREGATE 32-400 keV band of
T90 = 252 seconds.  In the 8-40 keV FREGATE band, the peak flux in 3 s
was approximately 7 x 10-8 ergs cm-2 s-1 (i.e., approximately
2.5 x Crab flux).  No duration or peak flux can be derived in the
2-25 keV WXM band because only the first 12 seconds of the main (second)
peak were observed by the WXM before high voltage turnoff.  The
statistical significance of the burst in the 2-25 keV WXM band in this
12-second interval was 5 sigma.
