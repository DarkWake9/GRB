F. Malacrino & JL. Atteia (LA-OMP) report on behalf of the GRB Real Time
Analysis System at CFHT (http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~grb/).

The orphan afterglow candidate reported in GCNC 4705 is an
asteroid called 2004 RF82 which was not detected by our
automatic search program due to its slow motion.

We would like to thank Paul O'Brien for pointing us the existence
of this asteroid, and apologize for the inconvenience that this
false alarm may have caused.
