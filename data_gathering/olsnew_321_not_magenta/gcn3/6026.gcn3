GRB070125 occured at 9.5 degrees zenith for the Milagro TeV observatory. =
This burst is the brightest that has occured within the optimum field of =
view of Milagro.  Very preliminary analysis doesn't show any significant =
excess.  The interpretation of this observation depends on the redshift =
of the burst,  because very high energy emission is absorbed for bursts =
at high redshifts due to pair production with the extragalactic =
background light.

We encourage observers to try to obtain a redshift for this GRB which =
would then result in the most stringent constraints on the ratio of very =
high energy emission to sub-MeV emission from GRBs.
