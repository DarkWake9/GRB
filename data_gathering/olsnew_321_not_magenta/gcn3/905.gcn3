K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 54229 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  8.
seconds, and a 25-100 keV peak flux of approximately  9.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over  .25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary,3 sigma error boxes each 
with approximate area 101. sq. arcmin. whose coordinates are:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   6 h 53 m 44.31 s    -57 o 29 '  57.84 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  6 h 53 m  1.38 s    -57 o 27 '   3.83 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  6 h 54 m 38.67 s    -57 o 24 '  52.08 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  6 h 52 m 49.82 s    -57 o 35 '   3.28 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  6 h 54 m 27.36 s    -57 o 32 '  51.48 " 

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  13 h 32 m 23.10 s    -41 o 25 '  43.27 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 13 h 32 m 46.49 s    -41 o 20 '  58.84 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 13 h 31 m 37.04 s    -41 o 23 '  31.48 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 13 h 33 m  9.17 s    -41 o 27 '  55.31 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 13 h 31 m 59.67 s    -41 o 30 '  27.91 " 

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further processing
within about 8 hours.
