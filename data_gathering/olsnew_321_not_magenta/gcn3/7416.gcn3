At 02:25:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080315 (trigger=306323).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 155.182, +41.729 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 20m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 43' 44"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for a 64-second image trigger,
the TDRSS light curve shows no obvious variation.  Further BAT analysis
will rely on the Malindi-downlinked data. 

The XRT began observing the field at 02:27:07.3 UT, 125.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the promptly available XRT
data. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 400 seconds with the V filter starting
125 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has been found in the
initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error
circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. The 8'x8'
region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error
circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction of about 0.04 magnitudes.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
