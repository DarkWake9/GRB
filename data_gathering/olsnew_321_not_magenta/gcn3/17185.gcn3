We observed the field of GRB 141212A detected by Swift (trigger #621229; 
Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 17158) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T11 (0.50 m Plane Wave) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory (NM, USA).  

4 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from December 12 
12:38:28 (UT) about 24.5 minutes after the trigger and stopped on December 12 12:43:22 (UT).  
We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked 
image at the enhanced X-ray afterglow position (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 17164).  
The estimated five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 240 sec) 
is ~19.1 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
