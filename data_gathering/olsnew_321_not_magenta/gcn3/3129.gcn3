UVOT team.

The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began
settled observations of the field of GRB 050319 (Krimm
et al; GCN 3117) at 09:32:48 UT, 90 after the BAT
trigger. A comparison of the 100s finding chart (with
mid-exposure 140s after the trigger) against the
Digitized Sky Survey reveals a new source inside the BAT
and XRT error circles at:

RA = 10h 16m 47.76(3)s Dec = +43d 32m 54.9(5)s J2000

and consistent with the ROTSE-IIIb position reported by
Rykoff et al. (GCN 3116) The V band magnitude is V =
17.5(1).

The UVOT obtained a series of images of this burst with
a variety of integration times. Mid-exposure times,
Delta-T, with respect to the BAT trigger at 09:31:18 UT
are measured in seconds. Observations with the V and B
filters are listed below:

Delta-T	 Exposure(s)  Filter   Mag
   140      100         V      17.5    (Finding Chart)
   380       80         B      18.8
   600       80         V      18.4
  1030      100         B      18.9
  1250      100         V      19.2
  5400      900         B      20.9
  7080      700         V      20.2
 17000      900         B      21.2
 18700      700         V      20.6

No signal was detected in the U band in a total exposure
time of 90s centered approximately 600s after the
trigger with an upper limit of U = 19.

We caution that the absolute magnitude scale is based on
ground calibration and will require confirmation in
flight.
