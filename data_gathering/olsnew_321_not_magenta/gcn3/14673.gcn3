We have observed the field of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448)  
for 9 epochs from t-t0=6.7 to t-t0=18.8 days after the burst event.   
The preliminary light curve in BVR and I bands does not show any  
evidence of a bump related to a SN, and it is marginally consistent  
with a SN component, which should be at least 2 mag fainter than 98bw  
at maximum.

The spectrum (2x1800s) of 13 May, after comparison with SN2010bh  
template, is suggestive, in the range 5000A-7500A of broad GRB-SN  
features, but altogether, we don't find the good similarity that the  
GTC finds (de Ugarte-Postigo et al., CBET 3529). The spectrum of the  
transient (after subtraction of a galaxy template) is available at:

Observations have been taken in the framework of the ESO-Program
