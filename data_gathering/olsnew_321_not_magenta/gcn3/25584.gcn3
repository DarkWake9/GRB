We observed the afterglow of GRB 190829A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 25551;
Dichiara et al., GCN 25552) with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
(UKIRT). The observation started at 2019-08-30 12:30:51.984 UT or about 16
hours after the event.

The afterglow is clearly detected in all J, H and K bands, and preliminary
magnitudes are derived from quick-look data, using nearby 2MASS stars as
photometry references.

Filter Date UT-start AB_mag

K    2019-08-30 12:30:51.984    16.95 +/- 0.21

H    2019-08-30 12:38:40.013    17.53 +/- 0.08

J    2019-08-30 12:46:27.005    18.09 +/- 0.05

This shows an J-,H-, and K-band fading of 0.75, 0.85, and 0.55 mag with
respect to the value reported by Chen et al. (GCN 25569).

Further observations are planned.

We thank the staffs at UKIRT for carrying out the observation.
