on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=153461) at 21:11:52 UT on 03 Sept 2005
is not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source.  Due to a 
temporary loss of Star Tracker lock, sources are drifting in the BAT FOV and
are causing these multiple triggers.  None of the triggers are real and
none of the positions are real.  Work is progressing to reset the 
Star Tracker.
