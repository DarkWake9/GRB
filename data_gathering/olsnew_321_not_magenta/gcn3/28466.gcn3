P. Dâ€™Avanzo (INAF-OAB), T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB), M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), 
A. Melandri  (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of the INTEGRAL-detected
burst GRB 200914A (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 28419), collecting 5.7 ks of Photon 
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+325 ks and T0+395 ks. 

The only uncatalogued source in the field, Source 1 (Perri et al., GCN Circ. 28425), 
is not detected anymore down to a 3sigma count rate limit of 2.1e-3 ct s^-1. 
From a re-analysis of the first XRT observation, consisting in 1.2 ks of data collected between 
T+9.0 ks and T+10.2 ks, we measure a count rate of 6.6e-3 (+3.3e-3, -2.5e-3) ct s^-1. 

Although there is moderate evidence for fading between these two epochs, we cannot exclude 
that the observed X-ray emission is coming from the bright IR source reported in Perri et al. 
(GCN Circ. 28425), possibly unrelated to GRB 200914A.
