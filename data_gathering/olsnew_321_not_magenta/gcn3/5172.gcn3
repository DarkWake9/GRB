P. J. Brown (Penn State), S. Campana (INAF-OAB),
P. T. Boyd (NASA/GSFC), & F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC),
report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

The afterglow of GRB060526 (BAT Trigger 211957)
reported in Campana et al. (GCN 5162) is also
detected by UVOT in the B filter, as well as the
previously reported V and White filters,
and continues to fade.  We report the following
additional UVOT detections:

Filter	Tstart-Tstop(s)	Exp(s)	Mag	Err
White	6335-6534	200	19.2	0.2
V	5311-5511	200	18.2	0.2
V	6744-6944	200	18.6	0.2
B	665-675  	10	18.2	0.4
B	6130-6330 	200	19.4	0.2

The afterglow is not detected in any filters
blueward of B, consistent with the z=3.21 redshift
measured by Berger & Gladders (GCN 5170).
The 3 sigma upper limits in summed images are:

Filter	Tstart-Tstop(s)	Exp(s)	UpperLimit(3sigma)
U	641-1492	58	>19.1
W1	617-1468	58	>19.1
M2	593-1444	58	>19.0
W2	693-1554	78	>19.6

In addition, examination of the event mode data of
the first V band observation, spanning 188 to 588
seconds after the trigger, shows an optical flare
coincident with the flare seen by BAT and XRT
(Campana et al. GCN 5163).
