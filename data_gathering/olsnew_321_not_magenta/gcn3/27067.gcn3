 We observed 4 host galaxy candidates with the 1.0-m telescope at the
Lemonsan Optical Astronomical Observatory(LOAO) in the initial localization
area of S200213t (Singer et al, GCN #27042) overlapped with neutrino
detection area (Hussain et al, GCN #27043).

The observation started at 2020-02-14 02:37:28 UT, 0.94 days after GW
trigger and each image was taken in R-band with 30 minutes exposure time.
No obvious transient has been identified. The list of the inspected targets
is given below.
