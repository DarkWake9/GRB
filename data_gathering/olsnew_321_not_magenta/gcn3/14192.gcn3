L. P. Singer (Caltech), S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), and D. A. Brown
(Syracuse) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the 3-sigma Swift UVOT error circle (P. Evans, GCN
14143) of GRB130122A (Swift546731, S. Barthelmy, GCN 14140) with the
Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope (P48) as part of the Palomar
Transient Factory (PTF).  Images were obtained in the Mould R filter
at 2013-01-23 at 06:27:39 and 07:11:25 UTC, 6.7 and 7.5 hours after
the trigger.

With sporadic cloud cover and a bright moon, we find no point source,
fading or otherwise, to 5-sigma limiting magnitudes of 19.1 and 18.4.
