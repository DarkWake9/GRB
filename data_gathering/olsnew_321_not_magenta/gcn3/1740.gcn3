Julie McEnery on behalf of the Milagro collaboration reports:

Milagro searched for emission at GeV/TeV energies from GRB 021211 over
the duration reported by the HETE WXM.  No evidence for prompt GeV/TeV
emission was found. A preliminary analysis (assuming a differential
photon spectral index of -2.4) gives an upper limit on the fluence at
the 99.9% confidence level of:

J(0.2-20 TeV) < 3.8 * 10^(-6) erg cm^(-2) (over a 6 second interval)
