The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:41:36 UT on 13 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200313A (trigger 605756501.620896 / 200313071).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 75.8, Dec = 20.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 03m, 20d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 103.0 degrees.
