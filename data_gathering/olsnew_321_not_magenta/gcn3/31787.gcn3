report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 17:16:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220325A (trigger=1099310).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 269.485, -7.031 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 57m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 01' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about ~8 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 17:18:13.2 UT, 110.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 269.48760, -7.03776 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 57m 57.02s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 02' 15.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 26 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 114 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.915. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Ferro (matteo.ferro AT inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
