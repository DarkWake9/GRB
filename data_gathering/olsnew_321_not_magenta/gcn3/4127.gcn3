J. Haislip, M. Nysewander, E. Cypriano, D. Reichart, M. Bayliss report on
behalf of the UNC Team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

The SOAR-4.1m Telescope at CTIO began imaging the afterglow of the HETE GRB
051021 (Yoshida et al., GCN 4116; Fox et al., GCN 4120) at 01:38:51 UT,
12.3 hours after the burst in YJHKs.

We detect the afterglow at a magnitude of J = 17.16 +- 0.06 based on three
2MASS stars at a mean time of 01:47:19.2 UT, 12.4 hours after the GRB.
