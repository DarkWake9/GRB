SUBJECT: GRB 150831B: Swift-XRT observations

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows
(PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S. Campana (INAF-OAB) and G. Cusumano
(INAF-IASF PA) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 150831B at 23:10:52.8 UT,
3085.5 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 271.03936,
-27.25933 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 04m 09.45s
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 15' 33.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 64 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 5.13
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
