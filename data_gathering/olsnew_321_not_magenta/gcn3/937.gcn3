GRB010214: BeppoSAX/NFI Observations

A BeppoSAX TOO observation of GB010214 has started about 6
hours after the GRB.
Preliminary analysis of the first orbits show a source in the
MECS(1.6-10 keV) image.

The position is:

RA = 265.234
Delta = 48.566

The error radius is 1.5 arcminutes.

We detect a clear fading behaviour of the X-ray source, but at this stage
we cannot exclude a faint contamination by RASSFS Catalogue source 1RXS
J174042.9+48340 at 2.2' which may slightly affect the position of the
afterglow. More refined analysis are in progress.
