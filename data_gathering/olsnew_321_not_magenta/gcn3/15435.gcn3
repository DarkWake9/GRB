report on behalf of SAO RAS GRB follow-up team:

We observed the GRB 131030A field (Troja et al., GCN#15402)
on October, 31, with the 1-m telescope Zeiss-1000 of SAO RAS.
The weather conditions were good. The observations were
carried out in three bands: B, V, Rc.

We clearly detected the OT at the level R = 20.4 +/- 0.1.
T_start = 18:16:11 UT,
T_end = 21:59:15 UT,
T_mid - T0 = 24.059 hours.
The total Rc-band exposure was 3000 seconds.

The OT magnitude was calibrated against the same set of USNO B1 stars
(R2) as in GCN #15412 and not corrected for the Galaxy extinction.
