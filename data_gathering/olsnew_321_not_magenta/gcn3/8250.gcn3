(i.e. the Swift-BAT team) report:
 
Using the data set from T-239 to T+617 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080916B (trigger #324907)
(Strata, et al., GCN Circ. 8240).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 163.632, 69.061 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 54m 31.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +69d 03' 38.2" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak FRED-like peak starting
at ~T-4 sec, peaking at ~T+3 sec, and ending at ~T+50 sec.  There is a
possibility of very weak emission lasting out to at least T+350 sec,
at which time the spacecraft slewed away fro the burst location.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 32 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.3 to T+35.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.3 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
