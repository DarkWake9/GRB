A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA) and P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf 
of the Swift-XRT team:

On 2016 March 16, Swift-XRT has carried out a further observation of the 
field of GRB 160310A detected by Fermi (Vianello et al., GCN Circ. 
19158; Toelge and Hui, GCN Circ. 19161), collecting 4.0 ks of data from 
T0+569 ks to T0+599 ks. The X-ray source reported by Gibson et al. (GCN 
Circ. 19162) is still detected with a count rate of (5.5+/-1.8)E-03 
ct/s, showing no evidence of fading. Therefore, this source is not 
related to the GRB. The 3-sigma upper limit for the observation carried 
out between T0+40.3 ks and T0+46.7 ks, computed at the center of the 
Fermi-LAT error circle, is 3.8E-03 ct/s. We conclude that no afterglow 
has been identified by Swift-XRT for GRB 160310A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
