K. Hurley and D. Gotz, on behalf of the INTEGRAL AO-6 SGR ToO team, report:

We have triggered an approved INTEGRAL ToO observation of SGR0501+4516.
The planned observing times during revolution 717 will be:

Start time              Duration (s)  
2008-08-27 00:46:16.0   105624  
2008-08-28 07:47:52.0    32274  
2008-08-28 17:39:00.0    44010  
2008-08-29 06:50:02.0    23472  

SPI will not be operating during these observations, due
to annealing.

We encourage simultaneous observations at all wavelengths.
