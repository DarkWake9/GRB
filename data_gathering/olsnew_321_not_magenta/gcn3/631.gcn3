NUMBER:  631
SUBJECT: GRB 991208, UBVRI field photometry

FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired UBVRcIc all-sky photometry for
the field of GRB 991208 with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope
on two photometric nights.  This 11x11arcmin field
covers the optical transient and extends a little
fainter than V=21.  All stars brighter than V=14
are saturated and should be used with care.  We have
placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb991208.dat

The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate
solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0; estimated errors
are +/- 0.1 arcsec on the brighter stars.
