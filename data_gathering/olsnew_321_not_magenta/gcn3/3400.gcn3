Goldoni, on behalf of the REM/ROSS Team report:

"We imaged the central part of the field of GRB050509 with the robotic 
60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla, Chile. REM is equipped with 
the REMIR near infrared camera (10x10 sq arcmin FoV, JHK filters) and 
the ROSS optical spectrograph/imager (10x10 sq arcmin FoV, VRI filters 
and AMICI prism).

Observations of GRB 050509 were performed in fully automated mode 
simultaneously in the near infrared and in the optical starting 
approximately 56 seconds after the burst (32 seconds after the 
reception of the burst alert). Then, 2 hrs after the burst, REM 
performed automatically a further observation of  the refined position 
of GRB 050509 few seconds after the new trigger delivered by the HETE 
Team.

A preliminary analysis of both the H and R band images does not reveal 
any new object down to the 2MASS and DSS limits respectively."
