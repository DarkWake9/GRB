Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Nicolaas E. Groeneboom (UiO), Jostein R. 
Kristiansen (HiOA), and Pall Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), report on behalf 
of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140629A (Lien et al., GCN 16477) with the 
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the MOSCA imager. 
Observations were carried out in the SDSS g, r, i, and z filters. The 
afterglow is detected in all filters.

In a 300-s image started at 21:17 UT (7.0 hr after the GRB), the 
afterglow has a magnitude r = 19.54 +- 0.02 (AB), calibrated against 
several nearby SDSS stars. Calibrated against USNO-B1, the afterglow 
coordinates are (J2000):

RA = 16:35:54.45
Dec = +41:52:36.5

with an uncertainty of 0.3". This is in good agreement with the 
determinations by UVOT (Lien et al., GCN 16477), MASTER (Yurkov et al., 
GCN 16478), and KWFC (Maehara, GCN 16484).
