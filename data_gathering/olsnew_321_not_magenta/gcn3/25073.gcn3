B. Sbarufatti (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

Swift has performed further observations of the field of the
MAXI/GSC-detected burst GRB 190708B (Kawabuko et al., GCN 25037). 
An additional 3.4 ks of data were collected between 5.96 days  and 6.11 days after the MAXI trigger.
Source 1, initially reported by Tohuvavohu et al. (GCN 25053) as the likely X-ray counterpart, has faded to a level of 2.9E-3 counts/s (1.3E-13 ergs/cm^2/s). 
Source 1 is  therefore confirmed as the X-ray afterglow of GRB 190708B.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
