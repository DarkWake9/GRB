and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

A short-duration GRB 160219A has been detected by Konus-Wind, Fremi 
(GBM; trigger 477557782), Swift (BAT), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, 
at about 24978 s UT (06:56:18). The burst was outside the coded field of 
view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
--------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg    Dec(2000), deg
--------------------------------
Center:
    1.3524          -21.9573
Corners:
    352.3480        -23.1597
    350.3712        -23.9066
    9.4050          -15.0431
    7.6407          -16.0195
---------------------------------
The error box area is 18.39 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 20.0 deg (the minimum one is 58 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 20 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
