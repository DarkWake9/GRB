MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB150210A 22 sec after notice 
time and 1364 sec after trigger time at 2015-02-10 22:49:09 UT by FERMI 
GBM coordinates  (ra=07 31 23 dec=+12 21 33 r=2.200000) (Burns et. al . 
GCN 17432). We cover a 70% part of FERMI LAT (Zhu et al. GCN 17438) error 
box with upper limit 17.5

MASTER II  robotic telescope  located in Tunka was pointed to the 
GRB150210A 3444 sec after  the LAT notice time and 60443 sec after trigger 
time at 2015-02-11 15:13:47 UT.

During LAT error box inspectoion MASTER-Tunka auto-detection system 
discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 07h 29m 40.10s +14d 14m 25.5s on 
2015-02-11.64502 UT (Gres et al. ATel 17446).

The OT unfiltered magnitude is 17.4m (the limit is 20.0m). OT is located 
at a distance 0.2W 2.8N from a center on unknown galaxy.
It seems that this supernova was found by chance during the LAT error box 
inspection.
OT image available here 
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/MASTERJ072940.10+141425.5.jpg
The OT is seen in 31 images. There is no minor planet at this place.
We have reference image without OT on 2012-02-18.58510 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 19.8m.
