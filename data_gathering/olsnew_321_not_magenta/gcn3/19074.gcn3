(INAF-OAB/PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 160223A (Markwardt et al. GCN Circ.
19066), collecting 8.3 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+109.9 ks and T0+197.1 ks. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected inside the Swift/BAT
error region, at a location consistent with the GROND afterglow
candidate (GCN Circ. 19058).  The position of this source is RA,
Dec=147.5977, +9.3696 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 09:50:23.46
Dec(J2000): +09:22:10.4

with an uncertainty of 6.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
location is 2.3 arcsec from the reported GROND position.  The observed
count rate is (1.69 +/- 0.75)e-3 ct s^-1, which corresponds to an
observed 0.3-10 keV flux of (3.7 +/- 1.7)e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1.  We
cannot determine at the present time whether the source is fading.
