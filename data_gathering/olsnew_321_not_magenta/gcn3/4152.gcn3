M. Nysewander, E. Cypriano, A. LaCluyze, M. Bayliss, D. Reichart, A.
Alvarez, P. Ugarte report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:

We observed the XRT localization (Racusin et al., GCN 4141) of HETE GRB
051022 (Olive et al., GCN 4131) with 4.1m SOAR beginning 11.2 hours after
the burst, in J and Ks.

We detect both A and B of Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 4143) and report that
neither appear to be fading in Ks between 11.8 and 14.4 hours after the
burst.
