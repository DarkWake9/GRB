TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1660
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021027 (two large error boxes)
DATE:    02/10/28 18:54:54 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

The Konus ecliptic latitude response restricts the IPN annulus (RA,
Decl(2000)=178.852, +35.645, radius 68.409 +/- 0.139 degrees, GCN
1658) to two sections, one between RA, Decl. ~ 99, +23 and 115, +1, and
the other between RA, Decl. ~ 200.,-30, and 225.,-17.

It is still not known whether this burst was observed by MO, and
thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
