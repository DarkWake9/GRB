S. B. Cenko (Caltech), D. B. Fox (Penn State), and P. A. Price
(IfA/Hawaii) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the short-hard GRB061210 (Cannizzo et al., GCN
5904) with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph in imaging mode mounted
on the Gemini North telescope.  Our first set of observations was taken
in r' at a mean epoch of 14:27 Dec. 10 UT (2.1 hours after the burst)
and covers ~ 90% of the refined BAT error circle (Palmer et al., GCN
5905).  Contamination from the nearby moon significantly affected the
sensitivity of these images.

A second r' reference epoch was taken the following evening, at a mean
epoch of 13:54 Dec. 11 UT (25.6 hours after the burst).  Digital image
subtraction using the ISIS software package (Alard & Lupton 1998, ApJ,
v. 503, p. 325) revealed no variable object anywhere in the field.  We
place a limit of r' > 23.5 mag for any isolated point-source afterglow
emission at the time of the first epoch.
