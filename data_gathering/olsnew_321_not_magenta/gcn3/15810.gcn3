L. Elenin (KIAM),  I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed of  the field of  the Swift GRB 140209A (Cenko  et al.,  GCN 
15808)  with 0.4-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory starting on Feb., 9 (UT) 
07:43:39. Series of 30 s  unfiltered exposure were obtained. In the combined 
images we do not detect afterglow  reported by  Perley (GCN 15809).

However we detect possible object (#2) in coordinates (J2000) 05 25 25.55 
+32 27 57.2 (uncertainties of 1 arcsec) which is the BAT localization circle 
(Cenko  et al.,  GCN  15808) and not present on DSS2(R). The object was 
detected only on the combined image of first 10 frames, and not detected on 
later combine images.

Preliminary photometry  is based  on USNO-B1.0 nearby  stars:
