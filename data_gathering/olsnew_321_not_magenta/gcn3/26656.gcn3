P. Veres (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-200107A (GCN
26655), at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported neutrino
location at:

RA: 148.18 (+ 2.20 - 1.83 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec:  35.46 (+ 1.10 - 1.22 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts
below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no
counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive,
coherent search for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the
neutrino candidate time. From this search, no significant signal was found
related to IceCube-200107A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in
arXiv:1612.02395, we set the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):

Timescale  Soft     Normal   Hard
-------------------------------------------
0.128 s:   6.7        15       25
1.024 s:   2.1        4.3      7.2
8.192 s:   0.79       1.2      1.8
