At 13:17:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090417 (trigger=349447).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to a Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 34.995, -7.181 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 19m 59s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 10' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 0.1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger.  This location
will not come out of constraint until 02 Jun 2009. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vanessa AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
