The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 12:29:09 UT on 13 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190813A (trigger 587392154.943436 / 190813520).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 106.4, Dec = -23.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 05m, -23d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 49.0 degrees.
