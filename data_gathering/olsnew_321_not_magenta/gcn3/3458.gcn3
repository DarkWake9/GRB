"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 050520 (GCN3430 ; INTEGRAL Trigger time is 00:05:53 UT)
with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope
at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 11:53:37 UT on May.20.
Observed field of view is 43 arcmin centered on
R.A=+12:50:50.9
Dec=+30:22:09.5
After co-adding a set of 5 images (11:53:37 - 11:58:08 UT)

Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than
17.2 mag.
