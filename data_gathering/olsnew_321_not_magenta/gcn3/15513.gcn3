A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA) and V. D'Elia (ASDC) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 3.0 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst GRB
131122A, from 13.7 ks to 21.1 ks after the INTEGRAL trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. An X-ray source is detected
within the INTEGRAL error circle. Using 1383 s of PC mode data and 1
UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 152.54219, +57.72770 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 10h 10m 10.12s
Dec(J2000): +57d 43' 39.7"

with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 50 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position. We cannot determine
at the present time whether the source is fading.
 
We note the presence of two DSS galaxies northbound the XRT source,
close to the XRT error circle.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
