Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201013A (trigger #999948)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 28607).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 107.392, 57.031 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 09m 34.1s
   Dec(J2000) = +57d 01' 52.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 64%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure that
starts at ~T-1 s and ends at ~T+10 s. The two main peaks occur at
~T+0.5 s and ~T+6.5 s, respectively. T90 (15-350 keV) is 7.36 +- 0.18 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.85 to T+9.64 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.22 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
6.7 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-0.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 24.6 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
