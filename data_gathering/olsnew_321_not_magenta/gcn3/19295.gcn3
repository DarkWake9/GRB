D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and C. Kirkpatrick (Univ. Helsinki) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 160410A (Gibson et al., GCN 
19271) with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. 
Observations started on April 10.92 UT and consisted of 3x900 s 
exposures in the SDSS r band.

The optical counterpart of GRB 160410A is well detected with a magnitude 
r = 24.15 +- 0.09 (AB), calibrated against nearby SDSS stars, at a mean 
epoch April 10.936 UT (17.3 hr after the GRB). The source looks 
pointlike in our images (with a seeing of 0.65").
