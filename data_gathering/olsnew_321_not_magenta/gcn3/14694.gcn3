We report further analysis of BAT GRB 130518B (trigger #556105)
(Cummings, GCN Circ. 14682).

The time-averaged spectrum covering 10 seconds of event data (which
includes most of the burst) is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.39 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
