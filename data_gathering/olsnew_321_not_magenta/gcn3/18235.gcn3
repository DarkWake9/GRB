W. Fong (U. Arizona) and B. A. Zauderer (Harvard) report:

"We observed the field of the short-duration GRB 150831A (Lien et al., GCN
18209) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2015 Aug
31.934 UT (11.9 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz. In 1 hour of
observations, we do not detect any radio source within or around the
enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 18212) to a 3-sigma limit of 25
microJy. Furthermore, we obtained a second set of observations beginning on
2015 Sep 2.954 UT (2.5 days post-burst) at a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz and
do not detect any radio source in or around the XRT position to a 3-sigma
limit of 21 microJy.

We therefore place 3-sigma limits of 25 microJy and 21 microJy on the radio
afterglow of GRB 150831A at 11.9 hr and 2.5 days after the burst,
respectively.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
