GRB 121017A: BOOTES-2/TELMA observations

M. Jelínek, A. J. Castro-Tirado, J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC Granada), S. Guziy
(Nikolaev Univ.), O. Rabaza (Univ. de Granada),
on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

“Following the detection of GRB 121017A by Swift (Grupe et al. GCN Circ.
13875) the 0.6m TELMA robotic telescope (+ COLORES) in Málaga (Spain)
started to take images (unfiltered) about 3 min postburst (19:26:10 UT),
following the initial BAT position. There is no optical counterpart within
the Swift/X-ray error box down to R = 18.5 for a 153s combined exposure (5
min post burst). Further exposures in i’-band (22:05 UT, 1200s on the
aggregate) set a limit of 19.5 (35 min post burst). We note the
considerable extinction (A_v = 1.4) towards this direction 6 deg below the
Galactic Plane. Observations are ongoing.”
