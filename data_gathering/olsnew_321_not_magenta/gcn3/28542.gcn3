report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:59:00.49 UT on 1 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201001A (trigger 623239145 / 201001416)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Simpson et al., GCN 28539).
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 28538) is consistent
with the Swift position.


The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 18 degrees.


The GBM light curve shows a  single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 15.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10.2 s to T0+12.3 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 71 +/- 21 keV,
alpha = 0.81 +/- 1.11, and beta = -1.91 +/- 0.15.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.6 +/- 5.6)E-7 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-2.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
