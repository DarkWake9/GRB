K. Polyakov (ISON), A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI),  I. Molotov 
(KIAM), report on  behalf of larger collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 140930B (De Pasquale et al., GCN 16857) 
with Santel-400AN   telescope of ISON-Kislovodsk observatory starting on 
Sep. 30 (UT) 19:52:24, i.e. ~10.5 minutes after burst trigger. We took 
30 unfiltered images of 120 s exposure. In the enhanced XRT position 
(Evans et al. GCN 16859) we do not detect the optical candidate (Tanvir 
et al., GCN 16861). A preliminary upper limit of the first image is 
19.5m (at mid time (UT) 19:53:24) and is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 
stars, R2 magnitudes.
