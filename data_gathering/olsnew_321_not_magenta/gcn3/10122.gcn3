report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the field of GRB 091102 (Hoversten et al.
GCN 10117) with the 0.6m Yock-Allen robotic telescope
(BOOTES-3) in Bleinheim, New Zealand. The observations were
obtained with clear filter and began at 14:35:04 UT (26
seconds after the burst). As stated by Schaefer et al.
(GCN 10119) using ROTSE-III data, there is no obvious
counterpart within the BAT error box. Inspection of the XRT
error circle shows a source at the South-Western edge that
is present both in the DSS and in 2MASS. Combining early
images we detect a further low signal source, with
coordinates (J2000) 04:50:27.22, -72:31:10.3. We note
however, that this is a preliminary reduction and that the
detection cannot be secure at this point. In the following
address we provide a finding chart indicating the location
of the source:

For the photometry we have used the star located at the
coordinates (J2000) 04 50 26.58, -72 31 35.3, assuming a
magnitude of 16.14."
