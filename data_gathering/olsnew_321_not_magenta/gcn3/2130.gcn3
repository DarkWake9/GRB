A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

The optical position in the field photometry file (GCN 2023)
   ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030329.dat
for the optical transient (GCN 1985) is given as
    10:44:49.957  +21:31:17.46  J2000
(internal errors of 40mas) using UCAC2 as the reference frame.
This is in good agreement with the recent, more precise,
radio position of
    10:44:49.9595  +21:31:17.438
given by Taylor et al. (GCN 2129).  The NOFS optical position is
also in disagreement with Yamaoka et al. (GCN 1994).  Yamaoka et al.
do not give their reference catalog, which might be the
cause for the disagreement.  The position given by
Price and Peterson (GCN 1987) does not have sufficient precision
in RA to ascertain whether their position matches NOFS and
Taylor et al. within their quoted accuracy.
