We observed the field of INTEGRAL Weak#8699 with the 14-inch
AGU Robotic Optical Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N)
located at the Sagamihara campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.

38 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
August 29 12:07:09 (UT) about 129 seconds after the trigger and stopped
on August 29 12:55:04 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow
both in the individual images and the stacked image.  The estimated
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 2280 sec)
is ~16.8 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
