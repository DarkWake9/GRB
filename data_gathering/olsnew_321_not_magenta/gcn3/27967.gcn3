The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:41:47 UT on 16 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200616B (trigger 614014912.725084 / 200616654).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 148.2, Dec = -42.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 52m, -42d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
