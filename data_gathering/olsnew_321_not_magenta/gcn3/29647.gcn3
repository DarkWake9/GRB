The INTEGRAL SPI-ACS undergoes a calibration phase each six month 
approximately. Due to technical issues,
the alert monitor was not switched off on 2021-03-12 from 4 to 8:20 UT. 
As a consequence, the series of alerts in this
time frame are of instrumental origin. We apologize for the disturbance 
this might have caused.
