L. Nicastro, E. Palazzi, A. Rossi (INAF/IASF Bologna), D. Fugazza (INAF/OAB) on 
behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the GRB150527A (Evans et al., GCN 17874) 
simultaneously in the optical (griz) and near infrared (H) bands with the 60-cm 
robotic telescope REM at La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started 
about 1 min after the GRB trigger.

An uncatalogued source in the enhanced XRT error box (Evans et al., GCN 
17879) is detectedi, only in the H images, at the coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 19:15:50.31
DEC(J2000) = +04:12:06.1

Possibly this is the same source mentioned by Butler et al. (GCN 17876).

A very preliminary photometry, calibrated against 2MASS, indicates that 
the object faded from H = 14.8 +/- 0.2 in the first image to H = 15.2 +/- 
0.2 about 5 min later. Thus we identify this source as the NIR afterglow 
of the burst.
