Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 191024A (trigger #931242)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 26063).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 10.129, -67.138 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 40m 30.9s
   Dec(J2000) = -67d 08' 17.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 90%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulsed structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+8 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 7.08 +- 0.98 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.96 to T+7.45 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.78 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.7 +- 0.4 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.31 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
