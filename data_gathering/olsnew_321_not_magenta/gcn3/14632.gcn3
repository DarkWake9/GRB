P. A. Evans (U Leicester), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. Palmer (LANL), R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 07:13:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130514A (trigger=555821).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 296.274, -7.956 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 45m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 57' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of at least 180 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~10 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:15:09.9 UT, 88.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 296.28055, -7.97808 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 45m 07.33s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 58' 41.1"
with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 82 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 7.65
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 5.83e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 97 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.23.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
