report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2020-07-16T22:57:41.18 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 200716C (trigger ID: HEB200716956) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM team, GCN #28123), 
Swift/BAT (Ukwatta et al., GCN #28124), Fermi-LAT (Ohno et al., GCN #28130) 
and CALET GBM (Torii et al., GCN #28139).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 2.16 s measured from T0+0.19 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.31 s, is 27488 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 6590 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
