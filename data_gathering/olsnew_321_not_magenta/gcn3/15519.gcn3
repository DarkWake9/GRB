report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 131127A (Markwardt et al., GCN
15516)  with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting Nov.,
27 (UT) 10:40:06. We obtained  several images in R-filter with exposure of
30 and 60 seconds. Within the XRT circle  (Markwardt et al., GCN 15516)  we
did not detect any optical object.

The details of the photometry are the following:

UT start,      t-T0           Filter    Exp.             OT     UL
                 (mid, days)              (s)                        (3 sigma)
10:40:06     0.02839       R        7*30+21*60    n/d    21.3

The photometry is based on 3 USNO-B1.0 stars:
