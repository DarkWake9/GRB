B. E. Cobb (GWU), reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 161117A
(GCN 20179, Cummings et al.) at two epochs (with mid-exposure times of
2016-11-17 02:38 UT & 2016-11-18 01:47 UT). For each epoch, several
dithered images were obtained with total summed exposure times of
15 min in V and I and 12 min in J and K.

The fading afterglow of GRB 161117A (e.g. GCN 20179, Cummings et al.;
GCN 20180, Malesani et al.; GCN 20181, D'Avanzo et al.) was detected
with the following preliminary magnitudes (or 3-sigma limits):

and IR photometry is calibrated against 2MASS stars in the field.)
