Diana Londish, Mark H. Wieringa (Australia Telescope National Facility)
and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a region covering the Swift burst GRB 060614 (GCN#5252)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array for two 10 minute scans at
June 24 11:44 UT and 12:29 UT. At frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6 GHz no
emission was detected within a 30" error circle of the OT position
(GCN#5255). The 3-sigma detection limits are 0.9 mJy at both
frequencies. Beam size was 2.6"x20" and 1.5"x11" at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz
respectively"

The Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
