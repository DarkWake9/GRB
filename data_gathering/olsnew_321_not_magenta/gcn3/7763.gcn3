S. T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT
team:

      The Swift/UVOT began settled observations the field of GRB 080516
starting 81 s after the BAT trigger (Holland et al., GCN Circ. 7733).
We do not detect the GROND optical afterglow reported by Filgas et al.
(2008a, GCN Circ. 7740) in any of the UVOT data.  The ground-based
position of the afterglow is 10.6 arcsec from the USNO-B1.0 star
638-018182, which has a magnitude of B = 12.  The afterglow is located
in the scattered light halo, and in the coincidence loss pattern of
this star, which makes our photometry somewhat uncertain.

      Upper limits from the coadded data are reported below.

These upper limits are not corrected for the Galactic extinction along
the line of sight to the source corresponding to a reddening of
E_{B-V} = 0.40 mag (Schlegel et al., 1998, ApJS, 500, 525).  The
photometry is on the UVOT flight system described in Poole et
al. (2008, MNRAS, 383,627).
