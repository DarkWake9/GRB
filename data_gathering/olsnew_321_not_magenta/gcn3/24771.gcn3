P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya, T. Khanam and A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed a weak detection of a likely long GRB 190605A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #24755) and Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov V., GCN #24756)

The source was detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple pulses of emission with the strongest peak at 23:22:28.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 189 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 482 cts. The local mean background count rate was 508 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 4.46s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
