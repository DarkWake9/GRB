C. Clemens, A. Kupcu Yoldas, J. Greiner, T. Kruehler, A. Yoldas (all MPE 
Garching) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest and MPE Garching) report 
on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080605 for a second time at 02:43 UT on June 7th, 
2008 about 1.12 days after the GRB trigger with 25 mins of effective 
exposures in g'r'i'z'.

We still detect the bright afterglow within the refined 0.5'' Swift-UVOT error 
circle (Kuin et al., GCN #7844) to the following preliminary magnitudes of

r' = 22.3,
i' = 21.7 and
z' = 21.4

with typical errors of +/- 0.1. Given magnitudes are calibrated against 
USNO-B1 field stars and might be affected by the bright, nearby star.

This indicates a clear fading of the optical afterglow compared to our first 
epoch observations (C. Clemens et al., GCN #7834).

Please note, that no correction for the galactic foreground reddening of 
E(B-V) = 0.136 mag (Schlegel et al., 1998) has been applied.
