K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and T. Cline,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed this burst at 55813 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~15 s, a 25-100
keV fluence of 1.8x10^-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over
0.5 s of ~2x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated this
burst to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area is
~100 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 19 h 58 m 19.61 s     23 o 32 '  35.15 "  (CENTER)
 19 h 57 m 53.11 s     23 o 37 '  42.65 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 58 m 57.36 s     23 o 17 '  35.48 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 57 m 43.17 s     23 o 47 '  26.39 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 58 m 46.27 s     23 o 27 '  27.73 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined considerably.
