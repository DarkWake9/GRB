At 11:38:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140619A (trigger=602080).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 27.092, -39.261 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 48m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = -39d 15' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:40:54.9 UT, 139.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 27.1084, -39.2586 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +01h 48m 26.02s
   Dec(J2000) = -39d 15' 31.0"
with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 46 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 5.85e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of  98 seconds with the White filter
starting 147 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a weak 20.5 mag source
near the XRT position. No aspect UVOT aspect solution is available
because of the paucity of stars. Confirmation of the afterglow
will require the full data set. No correction has been made
for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.01. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. De Pasquale (mdp AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
