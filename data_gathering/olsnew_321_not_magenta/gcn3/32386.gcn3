R. Sanchez-Ramirez, Y.-D. Hu, I. Perez-Garcia, M.D. Caballero-Garcia, A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:
We observed the field of GRB220711B (Fermi GBM team GCNc 32365, D'Ai et al. GCNc 32366) with the Espectrografo Multiobjeto Infra-Rojo (EMIR), mounted on the 10.4m Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) in La Palma (Spain).
Imaging observations started on Jul 12 at 00:32:14 (~4.3 hrs after the GRB) and were carried out in the J and Ks bands for a total exposure time of 1260s in each filter.
The afterglow reported by Malesani et al. (GCNc 32368 and 32377) is clearly detected in a preliminary reduction of both filters, measuring J~21.3 AB.

A second epoch was obtained on Jul 12 at 23:31:10 in the J band, observing a decay of about 1 magnitude between both epochs.

Further observations are planned.

We thank the excellent support from the GTC staff.
