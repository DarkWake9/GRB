report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:46:32.96 UT on 23 March 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200323A (trigger 606681997 / 200323782).

The location for this GRB was reported in the Fermi GBM Final Real-time
Localization GCN (GCN 27422).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 18
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 2.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+3.6 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 63.0 +/- 3.7 keV,
alpha = -0.73 +/- 0.10, and beta = -2.50 +/- 0.09.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.23 +/- 0.10)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.32 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 25.60 +/- 0.44 ph/s/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.58 s in the same band
is 34.0 +/- 1.9 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
