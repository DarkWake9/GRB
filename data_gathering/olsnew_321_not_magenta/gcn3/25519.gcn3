The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:44:26 UT on 28 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190828C (trigger 588696271.447674 / 190828614).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 191.2, Dec = -58.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 44m, -58d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 61.0 degrees.
