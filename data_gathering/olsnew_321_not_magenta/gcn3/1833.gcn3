Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and HETE-FREGATE  observed this GRB at
45157 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately  50 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
2.9E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.6E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 357.725 -40.065 degrees, whose radius is 66.291 +/-  0.017
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
