D. A. Perley, J. S. Bloom, M. Modjaz, and D. Kocevski (UC Berkeley) report:

We slewed to the afterglow position with the Keck I telescope (+LRIS) 
and began taking imaging exposures at 12:50:58 UT, ten minutes after the 
trigger.   By visual comparsion with the DSS we identify a faint 
candidate optical afterglow at the position:

RA = 00:33:47.412
dec = +61:03:34.09

Further observations of the afterglow candidate are ongoing.
