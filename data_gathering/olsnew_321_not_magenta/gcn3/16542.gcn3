W. Fong and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the field of the Swift-detected SGR 1935+2154 (GRB 140705A;
Stamatikos et al., GCN 16520) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) beginning on 2014 Jul 6.34 UT (22.69 hr after the BAT trigger) at a
mean frequency of 6 GHz. In 1 hour of observations, we do not detect any
radio emission within the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 16521)
to a 3-sigma limit of 41 microJy."
