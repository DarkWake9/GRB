We performed an analysis of AGILE data of the GRB 170127C (Fermi/GBM
trigger num 507173752; GCN #20543), which occurred at 2017-01-27
01:35:47.79 UTC.

The Mini-CALorimeter (MCAL), sensitive in the energy range from 400 keV
to 100 MeV, detected a short burst at T0 = 2017-01-27 01:35:47.9294 UTC,
that triggered both the on-board 16 ms and 64 ms timescale hardware logic
system. The MCAL light curve shows a sharp single peak, that lasted about
0.13 s and released a total number of ~980 counts above 400 keV in the
detector, above an average background rate of 590 counts/s.

The time-integrated spectrum measured between T0 and T0+0.13 s can be fit
in the energy range 0.5 - 20 MeV with a power law with high-energy
cut-off at 1.63 MeV, with photon index -1.64±0.19 and reduced chi-squared
1.08 (18 d.o.f.). As observed by MCAL, the burst fluence in the same
energy range and time interval is 1.20±0.01e-6 erg cm-2. All quoted
errors are at 90% confidence levels.

SuperAGILE, sensitive in the energy range 18 to 60 keV, also clearly
detected the burst with its ratemeters.
