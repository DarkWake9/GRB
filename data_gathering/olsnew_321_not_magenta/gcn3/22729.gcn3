A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), D. A. Kann, L. Izzo, C. C. Thoene (all HETH/IAA-CSIC), and A. Sota (IAA-CSIC) report:

We have observed the field of GRB 180514A (LaPorte et al. GCN 22723) with the 1.5m  telescope at the Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada, Spain). Observations started at 20:50 UT (7.41 hr after the burst) and consisted of multiple 300 s exposures in the Ic-band.

No object is detected within the XRT error circle in the first combined 10 x 300 s exposure, which has been obtained at average time of 7.87 hr after the burst, down to a 3-sigma limit of Ic (AB) > 21.5 mag, as compared with SDSS DR14 field stars.
