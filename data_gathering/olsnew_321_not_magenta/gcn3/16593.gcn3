B. A. Zauderer, W. Fong, and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration
as part of the CARMA Key Project "A Millimeter View of the Transient
Universe":

"We observed the position of GRB 140713A (Mangano et al., GCN 16581) with
the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) beginning 2014 Jul 15.27
(dt = 0.49 d)
at a mean frequency of 85 GHz.  Observations were conducted in the compact
E configuration.
In 3.2 hours of on-source integration, we detect a radio source with a peak
brightness of
1.5 (+/- 0.3) mJy/bm at a position consistent with the enhanced Swift-XRT
position (Beardmore et al.,
GCN 16585).  We consider this source to be the putative radio afterglow.
Further observations are planned.

We thank the CARMA observers and staff for prompt execution of
these observations."
