Report:

The observation of the GRB060117 (GCN 4533, 4534, 4535)
started with a 10s R-band exposure at 06:52:05.4 UT, i.e. 124s
after the GRB. The afterglow magnitude is 11.5+/-0.3
(calibration noise) and faded by 1.4mag during the first 120s
of observation.

The optical candidate is at a refined position:
21:51:36.13 -59:58:39.1 +/-1.5" (J2000)

We note that the originally reported position was wrong by 20"
in declination.

[GCN OPS NOTE(07apr10): As pointed out by F.Marshall, the missing
minus sign on the declination was added.]
