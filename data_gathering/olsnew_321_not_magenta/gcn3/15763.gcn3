F. V. Ferrante (SMU), W. Zheng (UC Berkeley), R. Kehoe (SMU), G. Dhungana (SMU) report on behalf of the ROTSE GRB team:

The 0.45m ROTSE-IIIb telescope located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 140129A (Swift trigger 585128; Melandri, et al., GCN 15760). The first image was at 03:24:58.3 UT, 57.0 s after the burst (8.3 s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We confirm the afterglow candidate reported by UVOT and detect a bright source which fades rapidly from magnitude 14.1 to 16.0 between UT 03:24:58.3 and 03:26:55.7. Continuing observations are in progress.
