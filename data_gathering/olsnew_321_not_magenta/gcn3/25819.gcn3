behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190923y at T0 = 2019-09-23
12:55:59.646 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 60% of the S190923y 90% c.l. localization region (LR) was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained
for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the
accessible S190923y LR, from a minimum of 1.08E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum
of 7.70E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with
photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
