The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 19:46:23.08 UT on 2 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200402C (trigger 607549588 / 200402824). This
trigger was initially classified as a particle event by the flight
software, but is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 226.4, Dec = -8.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 06m, -08d 06'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 9.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83 degrees.
