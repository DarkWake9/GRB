The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:45:57.61 UT on 4 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201004A (trigger 623493962/ 201004365). This
trigger was initially classified as Distant Particles event by the flight
software, but is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA =
30.1, Dec = 61.2(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 2 h 00 m, 61 d 12'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 4.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 142 degrees.
