S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  E.Bozzo,
C.Ferrigno, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 160 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 23:51:40  UT of July 15, 2020.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.= 248.5372   deg
DEC.=  -51.8392  deg
with an uncertainty of  1.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

Due to telemetry saturation, we can provide only lower limits to its peak
flux and fluence.
The   peak flux is greater than 1.2  ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration
time) and the fluence in the same energy range is greater than  1.8e-6
 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
