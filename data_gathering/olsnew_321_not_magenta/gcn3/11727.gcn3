"At 05:17:11.27 UT on 13 February 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110213A (trigger 319267033 / 110213220)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(D'Elia et al. 2011, GCN 11705).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 101 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 33 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.072 s to T0+31.745 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.44 (+/- 0.05) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 98.4 (+8.5/-6.9) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.03 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+18.17 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 17.7 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
