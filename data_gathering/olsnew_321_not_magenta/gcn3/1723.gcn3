TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1723
SUBJECT: GRB021201, BVRcIc field photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired shallow BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 20x20 arcmin field centered at the IPN coordinates
for GRB021201 (Hurley et al., GCN 1719) with the USNOFS 1.0-m
telescope on one photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=13.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb021201.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

If an afterglow is discovered, we will extend this calibration
with additional nights to ensure against a systematic zeropoint error,
and to include U-band measures.  You should check the dates on
the .dat file prior to final publication to get the latest photometry.
