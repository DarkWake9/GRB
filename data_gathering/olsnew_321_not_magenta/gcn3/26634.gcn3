The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 16:16:50 UT on 3 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200103A (trigger 599761015.018562 / 200103678).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 355.4, Dec = -38.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 41m, -38d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
