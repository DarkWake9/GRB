report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:04:38.33 UT on 29 03 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140329A (trigger 417769481 / 140329295).
The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR), but FERMI
went into SAA 120 seconds after trigger.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 149.8, DEC = -27.44 (J2000 degrees), with an uncertainty
of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 114 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of two pulses seperated by about 25 seconds
with a duration (T90) of about 21.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.3 s to T0+33.6 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 244 +/- 5 keV,
alpha = -0.83 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.38 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.07 +/- 0.05)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+23.6 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 102.0 +/- 1.0 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
