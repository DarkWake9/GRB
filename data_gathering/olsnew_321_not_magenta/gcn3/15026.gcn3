report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:37:11 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an unknown source (trigger=563980).  This occurred during
an episode of intermitant TDRSS connection, so most of the 
telemetry messages were not received.  Swift did not slew to the source. 

Due to the telemetry gaps, we will not know the location or the
characteristics of this source until ground-linked data is available.
