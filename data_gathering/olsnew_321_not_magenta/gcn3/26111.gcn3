The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:23:31 UT on 31 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191031C (trigger 594249816.128134 / 191031891).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 282.8, Dec = 55.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 51m, 55d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 58.0 degrees.
