Using the data set from T-100 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200713A
(trigger #982201) (Lien et al., GCN Circ. 28088).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 76.941, -32.846 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 07m 45.8s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 50' 47.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several weak overlapping pulses
that start at ~T+20 s and end at ~T+80 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 48.98 +- 9.52 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+18.45 to T+74.94 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.48 +- 0.32.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 9.0 +- 1.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+49.94 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
