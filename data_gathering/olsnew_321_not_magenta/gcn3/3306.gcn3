J. S. Bloom (UCB) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 050421 (GCN 3296, GCN 3301) with the
PAIRITEL 1.3m on Mt. Hopkins over several epochs. In a 502 sec exposure
beginning on 2005-04-21 11:23:45 UT, we find a faint source in J,H,Ks,
consistent with XRT position, located at:

  RA   20:29:00.94
  DEC +73:39.19.2  (J2000; uncertainty ~ 0.5 arcsec)

We have not checked the variability of this source so its identification
as the afterglow cannot be confirmed at this time. We note that there is
also a JHKs source just outside the XRT 5 arcsec error radius at (end
figures): 02.01, 22.3."
