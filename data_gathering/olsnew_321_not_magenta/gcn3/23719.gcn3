M. H. Siegel (PSU) and S. J. LaPorte (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 190114A
258 s after the BAT trigger (LaPorte et al., GCN Circ. 23677).
We confirm a source consistent with the XRT position (Evans et al. GCN
Circ. 23681) as initially reported in UVOT (Siegel \& LaPorte, GCN Circ. 23678)
 and later detected by GROND (Bolmer \& Schady, GCN Circ. 23682), OSN (de Ugarte
Postigo et al., GCN Circ. 23687) and NOT (Selsing et al., GCN Circ. 23697).
Notably, the optical counterpart was not seen in the initial finding chart and
had faded beyond detectability by the second orbit. The lack of detection in any
of the NUV filters would be consistent with the redshift of 3.4 reported by
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN Circ. 23680).

The preliminary UVOT position is:
   RA  (J2000) =  04:22:10.55 =  65.54397 (deg.)
   Dec (J2000) = +02:11:29.6  =   2.19157 (deg.)
with an estimated uncertainty of 0.42 arc sec. (radius, 90% confidence).

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.22 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
