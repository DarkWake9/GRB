F. Knust (MPE Garching), T. Kruehler (DARK), J. Greiner (MPE) and
S. Klose (TLS Tautenburg) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 120922A (Swift trigger 534394; Yershov et 
al., GCN 13793) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla 
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 23:30 UT on Sep 22, 60 min after the GRB trigger.
We detect a bright source within the enhanced Swift/XRT error circle 
reported by Evans (GCN 13794) at coordinates RA, DEC (J2000) = 
15:38:59.64, -20:10:54.2 (+/- 0.3 arcsec) with (AB mag)

r' = 19.5 +/- 0.1,

calibrated against the GROND zeropoint and not corrected for the Galactic 
foreground reddening of E_(B-V)= 0.15 mag in the direction of the burst 
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
