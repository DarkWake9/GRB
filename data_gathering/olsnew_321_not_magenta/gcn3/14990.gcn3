A. Corsi (GWU), D. A. Perley (Caltech), and S. B. Cenko (GSFC) report:
 
We observed the location of iPTF13bxl, the optical counterpart to
GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967), with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array in C-band on 2013-07-04 UT, 2.29 days after the GBM trigger. 
We detect a radio source at this location with a flux of 1.49 mJy at 5.1 GHz, 
and 1.60 mJy at 7.1 GHz. The map noise is 0.011 mJy.
