TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8010
SUBJECT: GRB 080723B - correction to flux conversion factor

FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <kpa@star.le.ac.uk>

K.L. Page and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

The counts to flux conversion factor in GCN Circ. 8009 was inadvertantly 
mistyped. The actual conversion is 5.9x10^-11 erg cm^-2 count^-1 (a factor 
of 100 lower than that previously given). This implies that the predicted 
flux at 24 hours is 2.4x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We apologise for the mistake and any inconvenience it may have caused.
