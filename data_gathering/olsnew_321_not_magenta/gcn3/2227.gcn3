TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030513 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 37026 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  3.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 331.777, -35.944 degrees, whose radius is 73.102 +/-  0.107
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus can be constrainted and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
