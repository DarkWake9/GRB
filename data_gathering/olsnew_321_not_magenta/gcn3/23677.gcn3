report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 03:10:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190114A (trigger=883600).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 65.544, +2.170 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 22m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = +02d 10' 11"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). Due to a telemetry gap, the BAT lightcurve
is not available. 

The XRT began observing the field at 03:14:56.4 UT, 246.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 65.54341, 2.19058
which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 04h 22m 10.42s
   Dec(J2000) = +02d 11' 26.1"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 74 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.62 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4.1
(+2.51/-2.16) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.18e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 257 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.22.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
