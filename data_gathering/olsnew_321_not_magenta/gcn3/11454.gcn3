David Gruber (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 10:49:20.80 UT on 13 December 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101213A (trigger 313930162 / 101213451)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Sakamoto et al. 2010, GCN 11448).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 129 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve conists of two overlapping FRED like pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 45 (+/-4) s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.536 s to T0+44.545 s is 
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.09 (+/-0.07) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 315.0 (+46.7/-35.9) keV
(CSTAT 740 for 365 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(1.40 +/- 0.01)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+2.944 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 4.67 (+/-0.32) ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well (CSTAT 739 for 365 d.o.f.) 
with Epeak= 309.7 (+48.9/-40.0) keV, alpha = -1.1 (+/-0.07) 
and beta = -2.35 (+0.29/-0.72). 

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
