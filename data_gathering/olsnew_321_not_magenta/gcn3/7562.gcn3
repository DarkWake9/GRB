K. Kinugasa, O. Hashimoto, S. Honda, E. Nishihara, Y. Kozai (Gunma
Astronomical Observatory) and H. Karoji (NAOJ) report:

 The field of GRB 080328 (Perri et al. GCN 7525) was observed
with the 150 cm telescope of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Starting at 09:49 UT (1.75 hours after the trigger), Rc frames
were acquired for 9 x 3-min exposures  under a poor seeing
(~4.5arcsec) condition.

 The UVOT position is close to a star, so that the field are affected
with the light from this star. We do not identify the optical counterpart
reported by UVOT to limiting magnitudes of Rc=20.7 relative to USNO-B1.0 R2
magnitudes at the meantime of 10:08 UT.

 Combining the results reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 7526), the decay
index is > 0.9, which is consistent with the intial index reported by
Guidorzi et al. (GCN 7526).
