D. A. Kann, B. Stecklum, and F. Ludwig (TLS Tautenburg) report:

We began observations of GRB 150213B (Swift trigger 631051, Pagani et al.,
GCN 17464) with the 1.34m Tautenburg Schmidt telescope about 80 min after
the GRB, at airmass 2.9.

At the UVOT position given by Pagani et al., we detect the optical
afterglow in multiple Rc band exposures of 600 sec exposure time each. Due
to the PSF wings of a nearby bright star, no magnitude can be determined
at this time, but the source has clearly faded compared to the early Swift
detection.

Observations are ongoing.
