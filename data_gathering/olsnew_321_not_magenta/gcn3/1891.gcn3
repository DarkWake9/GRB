D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 54173 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 80 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  9.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  5.2E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 168.733, 42.050 degrees, whose radius is 67.501 +/-  0.172
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
