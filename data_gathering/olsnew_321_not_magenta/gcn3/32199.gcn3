The long GRB 220612A (Swift/BAT-GUANO detection: DeLaunay et al.,
GCN Circ. 32198) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 06:55:22.451 UTC on 12 June 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1339051922/index.html).
The burst signal was faintly seen by only the SGM detector.

The light curve of the SGM shows two weak pulses.  The emission starts
at T+2.8 sec, peaks at T+6.2 sec, and ends at T+19.7 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 15.0 +/- 1.0 sec
and 8.0 +/- 1.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
