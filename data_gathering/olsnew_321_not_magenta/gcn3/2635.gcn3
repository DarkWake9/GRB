"We have acquired two set of images of the GRB 040730 error box, provided
by INTEGRAL (Gotz et al. GCN 2634), with the 0.6 m telescope (+MOA camera)
at the Mt. John Observatory. The observations were performed with the MOA
broad R band filter (similar to Ic); individual exposure times were 300 s.
The two sets are composed of three images each (Texp = 3 x 300 s), the
first one taken on July 30.2992-30.3126 UT (t-to ~ 5.2 hr) and the second
one 30.5215-30.5349 UT (t-to ~ 10.7 hr). Visual comparison of the two
epochs did not reveal variable sources brighter than Ic ~ 20. We note 
the severe Galactic extinction in the GRB line of sight (A_I ~ 2.3 mag)."
