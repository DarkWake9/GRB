We report the detection by the BAT Slew Survey (BATSS) of a burst in  
the slew that started at 11:13:02 UT, at the position:
  RA (J2000): 17h 26m 42s
  Dec(J2000): -53d 11' 20"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin (90% confidence). This position is  
the weighted average of independent 8.7 sigma and 7.6 sigma detections  
made in the 15-50keV and 50-150keV energy bands, respectively.  
Preliminary lightcurve analysis shows a main peak in both energy bands  
at T+8sec (223384448s MET).

BATSS pipeline processing is in the final stages of development  
following our first preliminary tests, which discovered GRB070326
(GCN# 6653). Full BATSS results will begin to be available soon from a  
website to be announced.
