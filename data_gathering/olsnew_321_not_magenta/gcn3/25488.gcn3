report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen) collaboration


We report the discovery of an optical transient spatially coincident with AT2019osy (Stewart et al., GCN #25487), a rising radio source identified with ASKAP during the follow-up of the gravitational wave event S190814bv (GCN #25324).  

The optical transient was automatically detected in public data obtained by the DESGW team (GCN #25336, GCN #25360, GCN #25373, GCN #25398) during the follow-up of S190814bv under the NOAO target of opportunity program 2019B-0372 (PI Soares-Santos). The data were processed using the image subtraction pipelines described in Goldstein, Andreoni et al. (2019) and Andreoni, Goldstein et al. (2019).

On the last night of DECam observations (MJD 58716.26) the optical transient was detected at preliminary magnitude i=22.3.
