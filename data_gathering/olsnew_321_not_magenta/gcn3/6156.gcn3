report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 2007-02-27 22:21:59 Swift-BAT detected GRB 070227 (trigger 262347). 
The burst was not found automatically onboard, because a planned 
slew terminated the trigger prematurely. The burst was found later 
in ground analysis. Swift did not slew to the burst, and a target 
of opportunity observation for this burst will be uploaded at 
the next command opportunity (around 1400 UT). 

The BAT position is RA, Dec 120.566, -46.305 (J2000)
  RA:  +08h 02m 16s
  Dec: -46d 18' 17"
with an estimated error circle of 3 arcmin. The burst was 
in the extreme partially coded field of view, the coding 
was 3.4%. 

The burst as seen by BAT was a single peak at least 8 seconds 
long. We have detailed information for only T-2 to T+8 sec. 
Since the burst was weak and on the edge of the FOV, and
because of the subsequent slew, we can not determine if 
additional emission occurred.
