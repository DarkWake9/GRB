FREGATE Team;

report that:

Post-processing analysis of HETE data has revealed the presence of 
GRB 050209, an untriggered GRB (=U11568) detected as HETE was 
entering the SAA. The burst was detected at 01:31:41 UT and had a 
duration of approximately 40 seconds.  The GRB has been localized to 
a circle of radius 7' (90% confidence) centered at:

RA = 08h 26m 09s, DEC = +19d 41m 02s (J2000).

Light curves in four spectral bands and a skymap for GRB 050209 are
provided at the following URL:

Because of the proximity of the SAA, extraction of spectral data 
requires manual processing, and will be provided in a follow-up GCN 
Circular.
