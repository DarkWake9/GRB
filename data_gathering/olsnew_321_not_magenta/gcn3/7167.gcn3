on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have observed the position of the X-ray flare in NGC 2770 (Atel
1353, 1355, GCN 7159) using Lulin 1m telescope and Mt Lemmon 1m
telescope operated by KASI Korea. The optical counterpart (e.g. GCN
7160, Atel 1356) is clearly detected by both of observations.  Our
preliminary analysis implies there is no significant variability
between 2008-01-10 18:17 (Lulin) and 2008-01-11 06:16 (Mt. Lemmon).
However, the brightness seems like gradually increasing.

Further observations and analysis are in progress."
