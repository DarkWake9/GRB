Using the data set from T-248 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 101008A (trigger #435903)
(Baumgartner, et al., GCN Circ. 11318).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 328.882, 37.060 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 55m 31.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +37d 03' 36.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 58%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like peak starting ~T-30 sec,
peaking at ~T+0 sec, and returning to background at ~T+100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 104 +- 35 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.0 to T+106.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.59 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
