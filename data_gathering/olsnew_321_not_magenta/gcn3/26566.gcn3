We observed the field of GRB 191221B (Laha et al., GCN 26534) with the
T17 0.43m telescope of iTelescope.Net in Siding Spring, Australia. The
observation was done with a SDSS r filter beginning at 2019-12-22
14:56:51 UT (about 18 hours after the trigger) for 300 sec. The
optical counterpart (Laha et al., GCN 26534) was detected with
r=18.4+/-0.1 (AB) by calibrating with the SkyMapper Southern Sky
Survey.
