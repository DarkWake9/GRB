J. Kirschbrown, C. MacLeod, D. Reichart, M. Nysewander, A. Crain, A.
Foster, A. LaCluyze report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration.

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically observed the localization
of GRB 050908 (Goad et al., GCN 3942) beginning 50 sec after the burst in
repeating blocks of BVRcIc (two filters simultaneously).

We detect the afterglow (Torii, GCN 3943) and measure its brightness to be
Rc ~ 19 mag at 20 min after the burst.

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
