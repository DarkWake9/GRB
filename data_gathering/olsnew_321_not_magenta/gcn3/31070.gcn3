Daniele B. Malesani (Radboud Univ. and DAWN/NBI), Paolo D'Avanzo 
(INAF/OABr), Andrew J. Levan (Radboud Univ.), Ana Nicuesa Guelbenzu (TLS 
Tautenburg), report on behalf of the Stargate consortium:


We observed the location of XRT source #2 (D'Elia et al., GCNs 31051, 
31068), indicated as the X-ray afterglow of the short GRB 211106A 
(Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31049; Ridnaia et al., GCN 31054; Fletcher, GCN 
31055) using the ESO VLT UT1 equipped with the FORS2 camera. A total of 
20 minutes on source were obtained in the R band, with mid time 2021 Nov 
9.116 UT (that is, 2.92 days after the GRB).

No bright sources are detected inside the XRT error circle, down to R > 
26.2 (Vega, preliminary calibration based on faint USNO-B1 stars). 
However, there are two extended (FWHM ~ 2") objects at the following 
coordinates:

RA = 22:54:21.31
Dec = -53:13:47.2

RA = 22:54:20.29
Dec = -53:13:53.6

The second one is partially blended with a brighter star. These two 
galaxies are 7.9" and 4.8" away, respectively, from the center of the 
XRT position (which has currently a 90% uncertainty radius of 3.4"). A 
faint extension of the most nearby object, or a separate, very faint 
source, is also marginally detected inside the XRT error circle.


Should the GRB be associated with one of the closeby galaxies, this 
would indicate a relatively low redshift. Lacking a reference image, we 
cannot yet ascertain whether a faint transient could be present, 
superposed on top of the galaxy light. Chandra X-ray observations would 
help pinpoint the precise location of the source.


We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff at Paranal, still 
operating at reduced capacity because of the COVID pandemic, in 
particular Eleonora Sani, Aleksandra Solarz, Rodrigo Palominos, Pedro 
Figuera and Thomas Rivinius.
