A. Henden (USRA/USNO) and F. Vrba (USNO) report on behalf of
  the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired shallow BV all-sky photometry for
a 11x11 arcmin field centered on the coordinates for the
optical transient discovered by Christensen (IAUC 8452)
and mentioned in the report by Christensen (GCN 2849)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric
night.  Stars brighter than V=12.5 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/sequences/lynxot.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to USNOA2.  The external errors are less than 300mas.
The estimated external photometric error is about 0.02mag.

We have also acquired three consecutive nights of unfiltered
photometry (similar to wide-band Johnson V) for the object
using the 1.0m.  Our results are:
  041213  21.118  0.054
  041214  21.062  0.067
  041215  21.098  0.062

In addition, we have 1.55m observations that indicate that
this object is stellar in appearance.  Our impression is
that this is a galactic source of some sort and not an
unidentified GRB afterglow.
