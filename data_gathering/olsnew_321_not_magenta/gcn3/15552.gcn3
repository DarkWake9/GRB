L. P. Singer (Caltech), M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie Observatories), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory (iPTF) collaboration:

The short-hard GRB 131125A triggered Fermi GBM (Fermi trigger 407089974)
at 2013-11-25 16:32:47 and was localized by IPN using Fermi, INTEGRAL,
and Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN 15546).

Starting 2013-11-26 04:16 UT, we imaged about 95 deg^2 surrounding the
Fermi GBM localization, covering most of the intersection between the
GBM 1-sigma statistical+systematic error contour and the IPN Fermi-INTEGRAL
3-sigma annulus, also including the entire intersection with the Fermi-Wind
annulus. Using standard iPTF vetting procedures including Palomar 60-inch
follow-up, we find no afterglow candidates to an average limiting magnitude
of R~20.4 at 11.8 hours after the burst.

diagram of the PTF fields observed in relation to the Fermi and IPN
localizations.
