E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and D. Fox (Penn State) report:

"The position of GRB 051210 (GCN 4315) is located about 8' from the center
of the galaxy cluster APMCC 736 (Dalton et al. 1997, MNRAS, 289, 263) with
an estimated radius of at least 6' and z=0.114.  We note that the XRT
position (GCN 4315) does not contain any obvious galaxy possibly
indicating a chance coincidence.  However, the burst duration and temporal
structure may indicate a short GRB."
