Giangiacomo Gandolfi, on behalf of BeppoSAX Mission Scientist, reports:

A BeppoSAX follow-up of GRB990806 started about 8 hr after the burst.
A quick look analysis of the first orbits of the MECS data at SOC
shows an object, previously unknown, inside the refined
error circle of the WFC.

Preliminary coordinates  are:
 R.A.(2000)= 47.674
 DEC(2000)= -68.113

 The error radius is 2'

BeppoSAX will continue its observation and monitoring of this source
until August 8.
