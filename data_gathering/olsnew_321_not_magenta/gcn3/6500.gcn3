on behalf of the Watcher collaboration report:

The Watcher 40cm robotic telescope, located at Boyden Observatory, South
Africa, began imaging the field of GRB 070610 (Pagani et al., GCN
6489) at 20:53:19 UT, 53s after the Swift trigger (23s after receipt of 
the GCN notice).

Our first 10s unfiltered exposure shows no new source in the XRT error
box (Pagani et al., GCN 6490) down to an R-band limiting magnitude of
approx. 15.1 (in comparison to USNO-B1).
A series of unfiltered 10s exposures were combined to create a 548s
exposure, with a mean time of 20:57:48 UT (269s after the trigger). No
new source was detected in this image down to an R-band limiting
magnitude of approx. 17.5.
