P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We have undertaken two short (~20 min) VLA observations at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz toward the BAT error circle of GRB 050906 (GCN
3926) on Sept. 6.52 UT and Sept. 6.58. There is a single radio source
displaced about 1 arcmin north of IC328 at a position (J2000):

RA = 03:31:11.75
DEC=-14:37:18.1

The astrometry error at this point is +/-0.5 arcsec. The source did
not vary significantly between the two epochs separated by ~1.4hrs.
Further observations are planned to determine.

Further observations are planned.

Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
