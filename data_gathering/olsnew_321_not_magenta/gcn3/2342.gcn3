behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)
observed this GRB at 60709 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 30 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately 7.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately 7.6E-07
erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 7400 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   8 h 40 m 42.11 s    -25 o 51 '  37.11 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  8 h 38 m 53.85 s    -25 o 39 '  52.63 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  9 h  2 m 44.40 s    -28 o 23 '  53.64 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  8 h 21 m 50.67 s    -23 o  4 '  39.06 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  8 h 42 m 31.61 s    -26 o  3 '  14.13 " 

This error box may be improved, but as Ulysses, Mars Odyssey, 
and Earth are almost aligned, a small error box cannot be
derived for this event.
