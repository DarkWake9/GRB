Richard L. Pearson and J. Ward Moody report for Brigham Young
Univerisity’s ROVOR team:

We observed the field around GRB 090429A (Swift trigger 350853,
Markwardt et al., GCN 9280) with the ROVOR (Robotic Observatory for
Variable Object Research) 16” telescope from Delta, Utah. Beginning 30
April 2009 at 03:46:50 UT (22.3 hours after outburst), observations
were obtained for a complete integration time of 50 minutes in white
light. No detection was made after stacking the images. Using the
magnitude limits established by Olivares et al., GCN Circ. 9303 on the
2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory, we estimate a
magnitude limit of 22 ± 1 mag on these observations.
