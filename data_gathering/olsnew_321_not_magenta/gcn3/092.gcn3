GRB 980519 Optical Observations

R. R. Gal, J. S. Bloom, S. G. Djorgovski, and S. R. Kulkarni on behalf
of the Caltech GRB Collaboration, report:

"In addition to the I and R photometry reported by Bloom et al. (GCN
#87), we have photometered the B and V Palomar 200inch images of the
field of GRB 980519.  Derived magnitudes of the following 7 secondary
stars are in the Landolt BV system (see GCN #87 for details):

Star      B    err(B)    V    err(V)
A       19.51  0.13    18.31  0.12
B       21.74  0.34    20.05  0.09
C       19.27  0.11    18.35  0.08
E       22.88  0.11    21.07  0.24
F       22.61  0.17    20.83  0.13
G       21.51  0.19    19.74  0.10
H       21.94  0.29    20.26  0.13


The derived magnitudes of the OT are:

         May 20.4485 UT, B = 22.53 +/- .14
         May 20.466  UT, V = 21.74 +/- .16
             
         May 21.448 UT, B > 22.9 (3-sigma upper limit)
         May 21.476 UT, V > 22.0 (3-sigma upper limit) 

The non-detection on May 21 is consistent with the power-law decline
slope of beta = -1.98 reported in Djorgovski et al. (GCN #79).
Moreover, broadband colors circa May 20.4 (BV reported herein; RI
reported in Bloom #87) suggest a spectral index of alpha = -1.26 +/-
0.3. This is also consistent with the simple blastwave model
(eg. Wijers, Rees and Meszaros MNRAS 288, L51.) prediction that alpha
= (2/3) beta.  The V-band point is somewhat higher (~3 sigma) than the
extrapolated spectrum, suggesting the spectrum of the transient may
not have been a pure power-law.  Lastly, given the general consistency
of spectral slope with flux time decay, we note the absence of strong
extinction in the OT (in contrast to GRB 980329).
