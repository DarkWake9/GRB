Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150530A (trigger #642018)
(Strling, et al., GCN Circ. 17888).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 327.511, 57.519 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 50m 02.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +57d 31' 07.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 17%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a couple overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+40 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.62 +- 0.84 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.21 to T+3.49 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.48 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.1 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
