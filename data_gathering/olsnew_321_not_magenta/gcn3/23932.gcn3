N. J. Klingler (PSU), D. M. Palmer (LANL), B. Sbarufatti (PSU),
M. H. Siegel (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

Swift Trigger #891843, at 23:11:53 UT on 2019-03-05, is believed to be spurious. 
Due to telemetry gaps only limited information is available about this trigger. 
However, based on the available data it does not appear to be an astrophysical event.
