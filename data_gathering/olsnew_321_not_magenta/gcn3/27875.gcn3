C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-200530A
(GCN 27865), the reported position:

RA: 255.37 (+2.48 -2.56 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 26.61  (+2.33 -3.28 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately from 24.4
minutes prior until 10.9 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM
observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
