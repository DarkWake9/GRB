The bright, long GRB 130527A (Swift-BAT detection: W. H. Baumgartner,
et al. , GCN 14708) triggered the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at UT 14:21:27.030(=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starting at
T0-0.5 s, ending at T0+13 s with a duration (T90) of about 7.4 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 5.26 (-0.36, +0.39) *10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+4.5 s was
20.26 (-0.92, +1.12) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-1 s to T0+13 s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.
the low-energy photon index alpha: -0.87 (-0.13, +0.10),
the high-energy photon index beta: -2.68 (-0.36, +0.14),
and the peak energy Epeak: 1426 (-123, +221) keV,
(chi^2/d.o.f = 36.3/28).

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 3% systematic error was added
for low energy channels.
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
