The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 06:11:39.12 UT on 5 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220405A (trigger 670831904.120598 / 220405258).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 29.4, Dec = -22.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 57m, -22d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
