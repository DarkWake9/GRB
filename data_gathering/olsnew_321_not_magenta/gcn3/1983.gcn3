D. Fugazza (TNG), F. Fiore, M. Cocchia, L.A. Antonelli (INAF-OAR),
S. Covino (INAF-OAB), E. Pian (INAF-OATs), N. Masetti (CNR-IASF), 
A. Buzzoni, G. Tessicini (TNG), on behalf of a larger collaboration, 
report:

"Starting on March 29 2002 00:28 UT we have obtained low resolution
(R~1000) spectra of the optical afterglow of GRB030328 (Peterson &
Price GCN #1974) using DOLORES at TNG.  Observations consisted of four
exposures, for a total of 2 hours, and cover the full spectral range
3800-8000 Angstrom, in good seeing conditions (between 1" and 1.5").
At the time of the observations the afterglow magnitude was R~20.7
(Fugazza et al. GCN #1982).

A preliminary analysis of the spectra reveals several absorption lines
associated with the z=1.52 system reported by Martini et al. (GCN
#1980), in particular MgII2803, MgII2796, FeII2600 and FeII2382.

Other narrow absorption lines are present in the spectra, but
a more detailed analysis is needed to their identification.

We are particularly grateful to the TNG staff for their remarkable
support to these observations."
