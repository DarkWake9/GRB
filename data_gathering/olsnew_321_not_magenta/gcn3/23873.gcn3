Using the data set from T-213 to T+456 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190203A (trigger #887512)
(Lien et al., GCN Circ. 23845).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 22.603, 55.736 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  01h 30m 24.7s
  Dec(J2000) = +55d 44' 10.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 21%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses that starts ~ T-60 s
and ends at T+40 s. Note that there is a large data gap from T-117.652 s to T-60.784 s,
so it is possible that there is additional burst emission during this interval.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 96 +- 16 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-60.784 to T+ 43.216 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.06 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.05 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.72 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.1 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
