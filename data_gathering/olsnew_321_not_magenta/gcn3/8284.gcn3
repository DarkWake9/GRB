The long GRB080916A (Swift/BAT trigger #324895; Ziaeepour et al., 
GCN 8237) was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 09:45:19.970 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a single peak at T0+0 s, followed by a second 
 soft peak at ~T0+16 s with a total duration (T90) of about 20 seconds. 
The fluence in 100 - 500 keV was (2.57 +/- 0.32)x10^-6 erg/cm^2. 
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+0 s was
1.54 (-0.12, +0.25) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-5s to 
T0+10s is fit by a single power-law with a photon index of 
1.58 +/- 0.29 (chi^2/d.o.f = 13.1/12) in 100 - 500 keV. 
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level, in which 
the systematic uncertainties are not included.
