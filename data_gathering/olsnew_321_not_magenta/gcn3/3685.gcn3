Analysis of the SWIFT XRT observation of GRB050724 in Photon Counting (PC) mode has revealed
in the first orbit a diffuse X-ray halo centered around the afterglow location. The halo has
the form of complete ring which increases in radius through the observation and reached
the distance of ~100 arcsec during the first ~2000 sec after the trigger (T0). We can exclude
it is due to instrumental effects. During the observation, which started ~343 seconds after
the burst trigger time (PC mode), the observed halo follows the expected behaviour of a "light-echo"
as X-rays are scattered by dust in our Galaxy. From the radial expansion of the halo we estimate
a distance of 175 -/+ 50 pc to the dust (from the observer, 90% confidence interval).

GRB 050724 is in the direction (Galactic) l = 350.37, b = 15.10 degrees, in which the density
of interstellar medium is quite high as testified by both the neutral Hydrogen column density
nH=1.5E21 cm-2 and the optical extiction E(B-V)=0.61 (A_V=2.029, A_K=0.225). This line of sight
includes the Scorpius Centaurus OB association at ~150-200 pc, consistent with the derived distance
to the scattering medium.

The X-ray WT spectrum of GRB050724 is represented by a powerlaw with Photon index 1.93-/+0.05
in the [0.5-10] keV band (as reported in GCN 3669; Romano et al.). The scattered X-ray light has,
as expected, a softer spectrum with Photon index 3.2-0.8+1.0 (first orbit).
