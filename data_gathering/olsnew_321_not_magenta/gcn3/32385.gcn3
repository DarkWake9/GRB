A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), M. Capalbi (INAF-IASFPA), M. Perri (SSDC
& INAF-OAR), V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A.
Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester)
and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst GRB 220710A, collecting 4.4 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+242.5 ks and T0+287.4 ks. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected consistent with being within
197 arcsec of the Swift/BAT-GUANO position and is above the 2SXPS
3-sigma upper limit at this position, and is therefore likely the GRB
afterglow.  The position of this source is RA, Dec=221.5668, +20.6576
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14:46:16.03
Dec(J2000): +20:39:27.3

with an uncertainty of 8.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 83 arcsec from the Swift/BAT-GUANO position.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021509/Source3.php.
The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
