B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), H. A. Krimm (GSFC/USRA), M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Examination of the full BAT data set for Swift trigger 629693 (Siegel et al., GCN 17394) shows no evidence for detection of a source and only apparently random fluctuations in the light curve.

XRT observed the field for 1.5 ks. No source is detected in the instrument field of view. The 3-sigma upper limit at the BAT position reported in GCN 17394 is 3.15 x 10^-2 c/s (~ 1.6 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1).

We conclude that this trigger was not caused by an astrophysical event.
