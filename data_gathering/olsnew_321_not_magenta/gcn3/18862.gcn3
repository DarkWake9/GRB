(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 160113A (Roberts et al. GCN Circ. 18861),
collecting 2.7 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+46.7 ks
and T0+53.0 ks. The pointing was aimed at the optical transient
candidate iPTF15flo (Singer et al. GCN Circ. 18859).

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the iPTF15flo
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit at the iPTF15flo position is
0.005 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 2.1e-13
erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020594.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
