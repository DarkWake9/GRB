behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060614 (Parsons et al., GCN 5252; 
Mangano et al., GCN 5254; Brown et al., GCN 5262) with VLT+FORS2. A 
spectrum was taken with the grism 300V (resolution ~10 A, wavelength 
coverage 4500-9500 A). The total exposure time was 50 min, with mean 
time Jun 21.365 UT.

Based on the identification of several emission lines, among which 
Halpha, weak Hbeta, [OIII] 4959, [OIII] 5007, we confirm the redshift 
z=0.125 reported by Price et al. (GCN 5275).

We acknowledge the excellent support from the ESO staff, in particular 
Riccardo Scarpa.
