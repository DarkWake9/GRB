L. Vetere, J. L. Racusin (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 2.5 ks of Swift XRT data for GRB 070925 (Mereghetti et al.,
GCN 6823) beginning 12 ks after the IBAS trigger. An uncatalogued X-ray source
is clearly detected at RA, Dec= 253.21700, -22.02856 degrees, which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000) =  16h 52m 52.1s
Dec(J2000) = -22d 01' 41.0"

with an estimated uncertainty of 6.0 arcsec (radius, 90% containment
including boresight uncertainty). This is 8 arcsec from the IBAS
position (Mereghetti et al., GCN 6823) within its error circle. The
source has a count rate of 1.6e-2 +/- 0.3e-2 counts s-1. At present we
are unable to determine whether the source is fading, however
observations are ongoing.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
