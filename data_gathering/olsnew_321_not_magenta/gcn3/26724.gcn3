behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200112r at T0 = 2020-01-12
15:58:38.094 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows
that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered the 28% of the
90% c.l. localization region (LR) (11% of the LR is occulted by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10
GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S200112r 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

from 7.4e-07 to 6e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 28% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0 -2s ; T0 + 2s );
from 3.0e-07 to 9.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 27% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 10s );
from 7.7e-08 to 1e-05 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 36% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
