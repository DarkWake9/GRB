FROM:    Kenzo Kinugasa at Gunma Astro. Obs/Japan  <kinugasa@astron.pref.gunma.jp>

K. Kinugasa and E. Nishihara (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) report:

 The entire INTEGRAL error circle of GRB041015 (S. Mereghetti et al., 
GCN 2805) was observed in J-, H-, and Ks-band with the 1.5-m telescope 
and the IR Camera at Gunma Astronomical Observatory, Gunma, Japan.
The observation started at 13:53:15 UT (162 min after the burst) 
on the night of 2004 October 15.

 We stacked 20 x 10-s J-band, 50 x 5-s H-band, and 50 x 5-s Ks-band 
frames and compared them with 2MASS JHKs images. We found no new source 
brighter than J=16.6, H=16.0, and Ks=15.6, which are near the limits of 
2MASS catalog.
