On 2008 December 03 I have monitored the field of GRB 081203A detected by
SWIFT (Parsons, et al., GCN Circ. 8595) with the 0.5m reflector and
ST-10XME CCD camera of Stara Lesna (Slovak Republic) observatory. My
frames confirm the presence of the afterglow close to coordinates (J2000)
RA = 15h 32m 07.6s, Dec = +63d 31m 14.9s (M. De Pasquale and A. Parsons,
GCN Circ. 8603 ). Observations continued from UT 15:24:45 to UT 16:58:45
in Rc photometric system. The object faided from Rc=15.74+/-0.04 to
Rc=17.20+/-0.06 during this time interval. Several BVIc measurements were
also obtained. GSC 4184 1309 served as a comparison star. The reduction of
the data is in progress and will be available on request.
This study was supported by the SAI scholarship.
