A. C. Updike, D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) and Todd Hillwig (Valparaiso University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:


The .9m SARA telescope began imaging the field of INTEGRAL GRB 070311
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 6189) 1 hour and 10 minutes after the trigger.  The 
observations were comprised of 180-second and 60-second exposures in the R band.  
After stacking one hour's worth of exposures, we do not detect the afterglow 
(Covino et al. GCN 6190) to a limiting magnitude of 19.6 based
on calibration to 10 field stars from USNO B1.0 R2.

We thank Jules Halpern for providing a finding chart based on MDM observations.
