N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) reports:

"Analysis of the SDSS pre-burst observations of the GRB 060218 field
(Cool et al. GCN #4777) reveals an extended object at 03h21m39.68s
+16:52:01.66 (J2000). Given the proximity of this object to the reported
XRT and UVOT positions for a candidate afterglow (Cusumano et al. GCN
#4775, Marshall et al. GCN #4779), this should be considered a potential 
host galaxy of a low-redshift GRB. Further multiwavelength observations 
are encouraged to confirm the reality of this trigger (Barbier et al. GCN 
#4780), and its possible association with this nearby galaxy. I 
acknowledge useful conversations with Richard Cool."
