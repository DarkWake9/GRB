We  continue the inspection of the  northern and southern segments 
of the LIGO/Virgo G2111170 event. We found one PSN in southern segment 
last night.

MASTER-SAAO auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 16h 
54m 20.77s -61d 52m 58.0s on 2016-01-06.06807 UT.
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 16.9m (limit 19.7m).
The OT is seen in 10 images. There is no minor planet at this place.
We have reference image without OT on 2015-07-15.88669 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 20.1m.
OT has offset is about 9.1E and 9.9N arcsecs from center of the 
ESO0138-006 galaxy.
The distance  d ~= 64 Mpc.

Spectral observations are required.
