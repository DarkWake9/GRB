We have completed the PSF photometry of the observations of GW170817 carried out at the T80S telescope and the EABA telescope on 08/18/2017 and 08/19/2017 (GCN 21619, GCN, 21620). We calibrated our measurements using the Pan-STARRS1 catalog available at STScI, using their reported PSF magnitudes and uncertainties. The mid-point of our observations was 1.467d after the GW trigger - LIGO/Virgo G298048- (Julian Date of 2457984.495). At that time, we measured magnitudes of g=18.60, r=17.99, i=17.80 with uncertainties of +-0.02 mag.
Additionally with our observations utilizing the EABA telescope we obtained  r=18.78+-0.03 at 2.456d after the GW trigger -LIGO/Virgo G298048-.
