We observed the field of the short GRB061201 (Marshall et al., GCN 5881, 
Markwardt et al. GCN 5882) with the VLT equipped with the FORS2 camera. 
Our observations started on Dec 02.014 UT (8.38 hr after the GRB). We 
took 10 I-band images, for a total exposure of 900 s.

An object is clearly visible in the resulting average of our set of 
images at the following coordinates (J2000):

R.A.=22:08:32.090
Dec.=-74:34:47.08

with an uncertainty of 0.2 arcsecs. This position is consistent with the 
one reported by Holland and Marshall (GCN 5883). We measure I ~ 22.3 
based on the
zeropoints reported on the ESO web pages. Given the different adopted 
filter and the large error in the UVOT measurement, it is difficult to 
assess
variability between the two epochs. We note that the object does not 
seem to be extended.

We also clearly resolve a galaxy 17" NW of the XRT position.

Further analysis is in progress.

We thank the excellent support of the ESO staff, in particular Paola 
Amico and Chris Lidman.
