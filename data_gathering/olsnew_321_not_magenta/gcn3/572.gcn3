report:


The error box of the burst GRB 000301c reported by Smith et al. (GCN
#568) was imaged with the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope on March 3, 4:41 UT 
- 5:38 UT using the near-infrared camera Omega Cass. The frames
were taken in the course of a project whose goal is to measure the
degree of linear polarization of GRB afterglows. The limiting
magnitude of the K'-band image is about K'=19 after adding all images
taken at different position angles of the wire-grid polarizer. 

The potential optical transient reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN #570) is 
clearly detected. Based on the assumption that the B-R colour index of
the star USNO 125_07686794 is representative for its spectral type, a
preliminary estimate of the K'-band magnitude of the potential afterglow
of 17.4 was derived.
