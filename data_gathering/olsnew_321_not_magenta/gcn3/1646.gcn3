report:


The error box of GRB 021016 (Hurley et al., GCN 1639) was imaged in
R and I on October 18/19 and 20/21 (2.3 and 4.3 days after the burst
trigger, respectively), using the Tautenburg Schmidt telescope
equipped with the Schmidt focus CCD camera (2k x 2k; FOV 42 x 42
arcmin). Several frames were taken (2 min exposure time each). The
limiting magnitude of the combined frames of each observing run is
about R=20.5 +/- 0.5 and I=20.5 +/- 0.5.

We do not find any potential GRB afterglow, neither in the R-band
nor in the I-band.
