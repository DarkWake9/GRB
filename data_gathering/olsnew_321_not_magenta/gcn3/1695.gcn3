Vanden Berk, M. Harvanek, A. N. Kleinman, S. Kleinman, J. Krzesinski,
D. Long, and S. Snedden, on behalf of the SDSS GRB team, report:

We have observed the field of GRB021112 (=H2448) (E. Fenimore et al.,
GCN 1682) using the SDSS 0.5-m "Photometric Telescope" (PT) at APO
under clear skies and poor seeing on UTC 2002 November 12 from 07:51
to 10:20 UTC, beginning less than 4.4 hours after the burst.  We took a
series of five 500-second g'-band exposures and five 500-second r'-band
exposures (41.5' x 41.5' field of view), each of which covers the
entire refined HETE error circle for GRB021112.  Visual comparison of
the r'-band images with the DSS-2 (R band) reveals no new object,
confirming the result reported by A. J. Levan et al. (GCN 1684).
