Using the data set from T-61 to T+122 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060210 (trigger #180977)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN 4724).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is (RA,Dec) = 57.728, 27.022  deg {3h 50m 54.8s, 27d 1' 18.9"} (J2000)
+- 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 41%.
 
There is significant emission starting at T-45 sec, lasting all the way
to a spike at T_zero.  Then there is decaying emission out to ~T+15
(with a small peak at ~T+10), and then there is flat soft emission
out to at least T+122 sec.  We currently have data downlinked out to T+122,
so we can not say what the lightcurve looks like past that point, although it
seems likely there is emision beyond T+122.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 46 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).  We will issue a another circular
when the full data set becomes available (probably Saturday).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-45.0 to T+9.3 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.47 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
(4.0 +- 0.2) x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T-0.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band is (2.7 +- 0.3) ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
