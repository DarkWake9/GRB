Takuya Murata (Rikubetsu Astronomical Observatory) 
and K. Torii (Osaka U.)
report:

 The entire error region of GRB 041015 (Mereghetti, et al., GCN 2805)
was observed with the 1.15-m Rikuri telescope of the 
Rikubetsu Astronomical Observatory, Hokkaido, Japan.

 7 x 60-s and 1 x 300-s unfiltered frames were obtained between 2004
Oct. 15, 14:37 UT and 16:39 UT. Comparison of the first 60-s frame
with the DSS2 red frame does not reveal a new source brighter than
about 20.0 mag (USNO-A2.0 R).
