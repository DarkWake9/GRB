MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) observed
  GRB060427B error box (GRB_TIME is 2006-04-27 23:51:55 UT, IPN 
triangulation, S. Golenetskii et al.
GCN5030) in survey mode at considerable zenit distances. The weather was 
good.
We start at 28 apr 2006 18:27:10.44 
(18.5 h   after the GRB time) and now we have more than 20 images (each 6 
square degrees) of the large error box.
We note that the error box is very close to galactic plane and we have a 
lot of objects. The reduction is continued.
