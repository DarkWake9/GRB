of larger Indian GRB collaboration)

We have imaged the field of Swift GRB 071010 (Moretti et al. GCN6859) 
with the 1.04m telescope at NainiTal ~ 0.5 days after the burst. 
Observations were performed in R and I bands in poor sky conditions.

We observed the afterglow candidate in R and I bands reported by Klotz, 
A. et al. (GCN 6860). Magnitude of the OT is R ~ 20 in comparison to 
nearby USNO B1.0 stars.
