D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The Palomar 60-inch telescope automatically responded to the alert for 
GRB 141026A (Hagen et al, GCN 16950) and began imaging the field at 
02:41:55.320 UT, 5.07 minutes after the Swift trigger.  A sequence of 
60-second r, i, and z exposures was obtained.  The field was at high 
airmass (~3.3) at the start of the observations.

We do not detect any clear source inside the XRT error circle in the 
individual exposures.  After stacking the first 11 frames taken in each 
filter, in the r-band stack only there is a marginal detection of a 
possible source at RA = 02:56:19.885, dec = +26:55:35.80 with R~22 mag.

Observations are continuing and additional follow-up is planned.
