report:
  
"The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope followed up robotically the GRB050713B
detected by SWIFT (Vaughan et al., GCN 3590) 3.3 min after the GRB trigger
time. The automatic "detection mode" procedure didn't detect any obvious
candidate to about R=18.2 from 3 10-s images (mean epoch of 3.8 min
after the GRB), with FOV of 4.6'x4.6' centred on the BAT in-flight
location. The above limit is also confirmed by visual inspection of the
images.
 
The limiting magnitude is automatically calculated with respect to the
USNOB1.0 'R2' values of the field objects.
 
Further observations are ongoing.
