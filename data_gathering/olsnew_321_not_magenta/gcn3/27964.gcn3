The very long GRB 200613A (Fermi GBM observation: Bissaldi and Lesage,
GCN Circ. 27930; Fermi-LAT detection: Ohno et al., GCN Circ. 27931;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200613A.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 05:30:08.657 UTC on 13 June 2020.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows the main emission episode which starts at
T-1 sec, peaks at T+11 sec and ends at T+35 sec, followed by a much weaker
emission episode which starts at ~T+278 sec and ends at ~T+423 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 381 +- 34 sec and
268 +- 237 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
