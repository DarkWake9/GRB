At 08:01:17 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060110 (trigger=176702).
The spacecraft did not slew because of the Moon observing constraint.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 72.741d,+28.380d
{04h 50m 58s,+28d 22' 48"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows a single
FRED-like peak structure with a total duration of 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 seconds after the trigger.

We are currently in the Malindi downlink gap, so it will be at least 5 hours
before we get the full data set on this burst.  This burst will remain
in the Moon observing constriant for 2.8 days.
