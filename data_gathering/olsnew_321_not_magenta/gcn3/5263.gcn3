A.Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB060605 (Page et al., GCN 5221; Rykoff &
Schaefer, GCN 5220) in Nordic Optical Telescope with ALFOSC between (UT)
June 06 04:27 and 04:50. Based on several field stars of USNO B1.0 we
estimate the afterglow brightness in a combined image (5x180 s) as R=20.32
+/- 0.013 at mid time T0+10.38h.
