In the search of the skymap of the NSBH event S190814bv (The LIGO
Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration, GCN 25333,
25324) the DECam-GROWTH team identified DG19sevhc (AT2019npy; Andreoni
et al. GCN 25362) as a candidate. It was followed up by Rossi et al
(GCN 25383) and Dichiara et al. (GCN 25374).  The latter reported an
unusual and rapid z-band rise, which drew attention.

We found a previous source detection close to this position on
difference images taken during the Pan-STARRS Survey For Transients
(Huber et al. 2015, ATel 7153) at i=20.9, on multiple images from
MJD=58335 (2018-08-05).  However closer inspection revealed that the
source was not a transient.

There is a faint red star which is coincident with background extended
flux (probably a faint, red galaxy) and the star appears to have slow
proper motion. This produced a dipole source in the Pan-STARRS
difference images, and triggered a new source detection.  The motion
between the Pan-STARRS reference and the image from MJD=58335 is
visually clear (about 1.4 arcsec).  

We further inspected the separate Pan-STARRS 3Pi epochs
(Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560C). Using 3 images with
reasonable S/N between 2010 September and 2014 August, plus the public
DECam image from 2019 August, the position of the star traces a vector
towards the S-E. We estimate a proper motion of 0.07 and -0.12
arcsec/yr in RA and Dec, respectively.

Hence we conclude that AT2019npy is not a transient, but resulted
from the proper motion of this star leaving a positive residual
in the DECam images of 2019 August, and the DECam references. 
The unusual spatial coincidence of the moving star and background galaxy 
made the original DECam identification as a transient quite understandable and 
reasonable.
