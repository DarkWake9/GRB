team, report:

The long GRB 080916ó (Fermi GBM trigger 243216766/080916.009; Goldstein 
and van der Horst, GCN 8245; Tajima et al., GCN 8246; Hurley et al., GCN 
8251) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=764.632 s UT (00:12:44.632).

The burst light curve shows the main part with a duration of ~70 s 
followed by a weak tail seen at least till ~T0+200 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.24 +/- 0.17)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+3.168 s
of (1.19 +/- 0.30)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+71.424 s) is well be fitted (in the 20 keV - 10 MeV 
range) by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.040(-0.058, +0.065),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.26(-0.40, +0.21),
the peak energy Ep = 505(-70, +79) keV (chi2 = 75.6/84 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
