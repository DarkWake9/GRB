SUBJECT: GRB 050126: A NIR afterglow candidate in the revised XRT error circle

E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) reports on behalf of a larger
collaboration:
                                                                                
"A further examination of our Keck/NIRC image obtained on January 26.687
UT (4.5 hours after the burst; GCN 2985) and a comparison to the revised
XRT position (GCN 2996) reveals a point source which is not present in DSS
or 2MASS.  The object is located about 1.9 arcsec from the nominal XRT
position at (J2000):
        RA = 18:32:27.17
        DEC= 42:22:13.6
We note that the previous source identified in GCN 2985 as the possible
afterglow of GRB 050126 falls outside of the revised XRT position.  At the
present we do not have additional observations to test whether either
object has faded."
