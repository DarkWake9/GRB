M. Jelínek, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada) and G. Bergond (CAHA
Almería), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

"Following the detection by Swift of GRB 090404 (Ziaeepour et al. GCNC
9086), JHKs observations (900-s each) were conducted on Apr 5.025 UT (8.5
hr after the burst) with the 3.5-m telescope (+ OMEGA2000) at the
German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory, under excellent conditions (0".9
seeing). At the Swift/XRT enhanced position (Beardmore et al. GCNC 9088)
no nIR source is detected down to a limiting magnitude H = 21.5, in
agreement with the limits reported by Afonso et al (GCNC 9096)."
