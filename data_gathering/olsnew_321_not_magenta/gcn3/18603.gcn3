J. Bolmer, F. Knust and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf
of the GROND team: 

We present further analysis of the GROND observations of GRB 151112A 
(Swift trigger 663179; Malesani et al., GCN #18588; Knust et al. GCN
#18595). 

After correcting for the galactic foreground E(B-V)=0.01 mag and 
fitting a power-law model to the 7-channel GROND SED from the first
night, 
we derive a photometric redshift of z = 4.1 +/- 0.3, according to the
g'- and r'-band 
dropouts with g'-r' > 1.5 mag and r'-i' = 0.9 mag. 

Based on the observed decay between the first and the second night we
predict an 
i'-band magnitude of ~24 mag for the coming night.
