report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 1385 observations of galaxies (from the
2MPZ catalogue) within the LVC error region for the GW trigger G275697,
using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. As this is a 3D skymap,
galaxy distances were taken into account in selecting which ones to
observe. The observations currently span from 15 ks to 350 ks after the
LVC trigger, and cover 167 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for
overlaps). This covers 0.16 of the probability in the LVC skymap, and
0.30 of the probability in the LVC map after convolving with the 2MPZ
galaxy catalogue, as described by Evans et al., (2016, MNRAS,  462,
1591).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected 15 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

Many more sources were reported via GCN/LVC_COUNTERPART notices, which
had the "WARN_FLAG" field set to 1, indicating that the automatic
detection system considered the sources may be spurious. Manual
inspection has confirmed these sources are not real, but were caused by
stray light - singly-reflected X-rays from a bright, off-axis source.
See http://www.swift.ac.uk/1SXPS/construct.php#fig5 more details.


The new, manually verified sources comprise:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 6 sources of rank 3
  * 9 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7


RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.
