A. N. Morgan, B. E. Cobb, C. Klein, and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

We observed the field of GRB 090515 (Beardmore et al. 2009, GCN 9356)
with the 1.3-m PAIRITEL located at Mt Hopkins, Arizona.  Observations
began at 2009-05-15 05:11 UT, 26 minutes after the Swift Trigger.  We
detect no afterglow at the XRT position in a mosaic with an effective
exposure time of ~330 seconds.

The preliminary photometry (calibrated to 2MASS) yields:

post_burst
t_mid(min) exp(s)  filt  U. Limit (3 sig)
30         330     J     > 18.0
30         330     H     > 17.2
30         330     K     > 15.1

All magnitudes are given in the Vega system. No correction for
Galactic extinction has been made to the above reported values.
