D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, RHESSI, and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at
29743 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately  18 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
2.9E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  5.1E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 650  sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  12 h 56 m 35.82 s  -48 o 28 ' -16.30 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 12 h 52 m 32.89 s  -48 o 43 '  15.55 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 12 h 56 m 56.56 s  -48 o 35 '  11.39 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 12 h 56 m 15.18 s  -48 o 21 '  20.97 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 13 h  0 m 39.49 s  -48 o 12 '  37.91 " 

This error box may be improved.
