D. B. Fox (PSU), E. Ofek (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (Caltech) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have imaged the localization region for the afterglow of GRB
070208 (Sato et al., GCN 6074) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch
telescope, in a series of exposures beginning at 09:15:33 UT, 5
minutes after the burst.

We confirm the point-like, fading nature of the afterglow candidate
reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 6077), although given the nearby
(candidate host) galaxy (Mirabel & Halpern, GCN 6075; Guidorzi et al.,
GCN 6077) we cannot exclude the presence of underlying diffuse
emission at this time.

In our images the afterglow has i'~22 mag at 09:18 UT and i'~23.4 mag
at 10:05 UT, corresponding to fading with power-law index alpha~-0.7
referenced to the burst epoch."
