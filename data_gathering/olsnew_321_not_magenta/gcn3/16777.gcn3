W. Fong (U. Arizona) reports:

"We observed the position of the short-duration GRB 140903A (Cummings et
al., GCN 16763; GCN 16765) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
beginning on 2014 Sept 4.040 UT (9.70 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of
6 GHz. In 1 hour of observations, we detect a ~0.11 mJy radio source at the
position:

RA(J2000) = 15:52:03.21
Dec(J2000) = +27:36:10.7

with an uncertainty of 0.3" in each coordinate. This position is coincident
with the reported optical source (Capone et al., GCN 16769; Cenko et al.,
GCN 16770; Cucchiara et al., 16774; Fruchter, GCN 16776).

Further observations are planned. We thank the VLA staff for quickly
executing these observations."
