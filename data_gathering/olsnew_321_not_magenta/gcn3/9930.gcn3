Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"There has been a typo in the GBM localization of GRB 090922A (Rau, 
GCN#9929). The
correct location is:

RA=17.1deg (01h08min) and Dec=74.3deg (74d18')

with an uncertainty of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,  
statistical only; there is
additionally a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 
3 degrees).

I thank S. Holland for realizing this."
