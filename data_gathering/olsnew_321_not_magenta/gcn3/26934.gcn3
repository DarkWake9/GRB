behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200128d at T0 = 2020-01-28
02:20:11.903 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE data shows that no
AGILE/MCAL and AGILE/GRID data were available at T0 due to a telemetry gap.

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV over time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of the
S200128d 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID value of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) is
obtained:

from 3.6e-08 to 3.4e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 44% of the
LR over the time interval ( T0 + 200 s ; T0 + 300 s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
