 We observed the field of GRB 200819A (Dichiara et
 al., GCN #28263;  Evans et al., GCN #28265) with the Himalaya Faint
Object
 Spectrograph and Camera  (HFOSC) mounted on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra
Telescope (IAO, Hanle, India). Multiple frames (each 300 sec) of the GRB
field in Bessell R and I bands were obtained with an average airmass of
1.3
and a seeing of  2''. Preliminary PSF photometry on the stacked
images was performed and calibrated against  USNO-B1 catalogue. We do
not
detect any OT within the enhanced XRT position (Belkin et al., GCN
#28266;  Jelinek et al., GCN #28267).

The estimated limiting magnitude is as under -
 Date          |       UT (mean)     | Filter |  Exp time x no. of
frames |  Upper limit (mag)
 2020-08-19        19:16:23          R                300 sec x 4       
               21.5
 2020-08-19        19:32:37          I                 300 sec X 4      
                20.3 

We thank the staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the observations.
