B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:44:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151112A (trigger=663179).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 2.045, -61.692 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 08m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = -61d 41' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a FRED-shaped 
profile with superimposed peaks and total duration of about 20 sec.  
The peak count rate was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.8
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Malesani (malesani AT dark-cosmology.dk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
