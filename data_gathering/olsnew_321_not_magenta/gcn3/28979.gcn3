Swift observed the location of 4FGL J0206.4-1151, the Fermi-LAT source
closest to the location of IceCube 201130A (IceCube Collaboration; GCN
Circ. 28969) for 4.0 ks between 14:42 UT and 18:05 UT on 2020 December
1.

The source is detected by XRT at RA, Dec = 31.6094, -11.8440 (degrees)
which corresponds to:

RA (J2000):  02h 06m 26.25s
Dec (J2000): -11d 50' 38.1"

With an uncertainty of 6.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 2.8 arcmin from the position of the flat spectrum radio
quasar PMN J0206-1150, that is associated to the gamma-ray source 4FGL
J0206.4-1151 in the Forth Fermi LAT source catalog (Abdollahi et al.
2020, ApJS, 247, 33).

The X-ray spectrum (0.3-10 keV) can be fit by an absorbed power law
model with a HI column density consistent with the Galactic value in the
direction of the source (n_H = 1.7 x 10^20 cm^-2, Ben Bekhti N. et al.,
2016, A&A, 594, A116) and a photon index of 1.7+/-0.7. The corresponding
0.3-10 keV flux (unabsorbed) is 1.6 (+1.1, -0.4) x 10^-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1.

Simultaneous UVOT observations were performed on 2020 December 1 and the
source is detected above 3 sigma in all UVOT filters. The measured
magnitudes (Vega system) are V = 19.48 +/- 0.42, B = 19.68 +/- 0.21, U =
18.99 +/- 0.17, W1 = 19.24 +/- 0.18, M2 = 19.30 +/- 0.11, and W2 = 19.21
+/- 0.11.
