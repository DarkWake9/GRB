D. A. Perley, C. M. Copperwheat, and K. L. Taggart (LJMU) report on 
behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We obtained two 600-second exposures of ZTF19aarykkb (Kasliwal et al., 
GCN 24191) using the Spectrograph for the Rapid Acquisition of 
Transients (SPRAT) on the 2m Liverpool Telescope.

The reduced 1D spectrum shows a broad (full-width ~ 15000 km/s) emission 
line centered at 6700 Angstroms, which we associate with broad H-alpha 
from the transient.  Narrow H-alpha emission at z=0.025 (likely from the 
host galaxy) is also detected.  We cannot confirm the presence of He II 
(tentatively reported by Pavana et al., GCN 24200) or any other 
significant features at this time.  These observations suggest that this 
source is a young Type II supernova, and is unlikely to be associated 
with the BNS merger S190425z (GCN 24168).
