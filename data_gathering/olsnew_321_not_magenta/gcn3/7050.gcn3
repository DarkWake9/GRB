M. Perri, G. Stratta (ASDC) and D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT began observing the field of view of the INTEGRAL-detected
long burst GRB 071109 (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 7046) at 22:21:50 UT
on 2007 November 9, ~1.7 hours after the INTEGRAL trigger. We currently
have 4.8 ks of XRT data, in which we detect a faint, uncatalogued X-ray
source at a position of RA,Dec(J2000)= 289.974583,+2.046528 degrees, which
is equivalent to:
RA (J2000  =  19h 19m 53.9s
Dec(J2000) = +02d 02' 47.5"
with an estimated uncertainty of 9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
This is 3.7 arcmin from the INTEGRAL position (Mereghetti et al.,
GCN Circ. 7046), outside its error circle. We note also that this
position is 1.1 arcmin away from the VLA radio source reported in
GCN Circ. 7049 (Chandra & Frail).

The source has a count rate of (2.5 +/-0.9)e-3 counts s-1. At present we
are unable to determine whether the source is fading, however observations
are ongoing and further analysis of these XRT data will be reported
in a subsequent circular.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
