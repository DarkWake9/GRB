D. N. Burrows, D. Grupe (PSU), C. Kouveliotou, S. Patel (MSFC), P. Meszaros 
(PSU), B. Zhang (UNLV), and R. A. M. J. Wijers (U. Amsterdam) report:

We observed the X-ray afterglow of the short GRB 050724 (Covino et al., GCN 
3665) with the Chandra X-ray observatory from 20:09 UT on 26 July 2005 to 
10:45 UT on 27 July 2005.  The total exposure time was 50 ks.  We find an 
uncataloged X-ray source coincident with the VLT source reported by 
D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 3690) and the VLA source reported by Cameron and Frail 
(GRB 3676) as updated by Soderberg (GCN 3696).  The Chandra position is:

RA (J2000) = 16 24 44.36
Dec (J2000) = -27 32 27.5.

The astrometry has been verified by comparisons with one 2MASS star with an 
X-ray counterpart on the ACIS S-3 chip.  We estimate an uncertainty of 0.2 
arcseconds radius.

The X-ray source flux appears to decrease during the Chandra observation, 
although with marginal statistical significance.
