D. A. Perley (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (NASA-GSFC) report:

The Swift-BAT alert for GRB 140215A (Markwardt et al., GCN 15837) 
automatically triggered the Palomar 60-inch telescope, which slewed to 
the position and began started a sequence of r, i, and z images 
beginning at 04:09:54 UT, 2.74 minutes after the initial trigger.  The 
optical afterglow is well-detected in all images and filters, and 
follow-up has continued through to the present time.  The afterglow 
light curve fades as a simple unbroken power-law with a decay index of 
alpha=1.19 throughout this period.  Calibrating relative to USNO-B1.0, 
we estimate a magnitude (in the most recent imaging, at 387 minutes 
post-trigger) of R = 19.93 +/- 0.13 mag.

Spectroscopic follow-up is encouraged.
