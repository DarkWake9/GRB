The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:15:41 UT on 8 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200908A (trigger 621292546.429748 / 200908886).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 169.5, Dec = -67.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 18m, -67d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 16.0 degrees.
