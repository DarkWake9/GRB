We observed the field of GRB 090429B (Ukwatta et al. GCN 9281) with the 
ESO-VLT in imaging mode with the FORS2 camera. Observations started 
about 1 hr after the burst. In our stacked images, no afterglow is 
detected down to the following 3sigma limits:

R > 25.3
z > 23.5

Photometry has been calibrated against USNOB1 catalogue and the SDSS.

We acknowledge support from the Paranal staff, in particular E. Mason 
and P. Lynam.
