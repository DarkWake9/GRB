Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report;

We have  carried out  I-band observations of  the XRT position  of GRB
090813  (GCN  9781) with  the  1.23m  telescope  of Calar  Alto.   The 
observations started  at 04:18  UT (437 s  after the GRB  trigger). We
detect an object  with a rough magnitude of I~17 coincident with the XRT
position  no present  on the  DSS. We propose  that object  as the optical
afterglow of GRB 090813.
