TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4168
SUBJECT: SGR 1806-20: continued moderate activity seen with INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/10/27 08:09:41 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D. Gotz (SAP, Saclay), M. Beck (ISDC, 
Versoix), J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization 
Team, and I.F. Mirabel (ESO) on behalf of the INTEGRAL Science Working 
Team report:

The soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20 continues to be in an active 
bursting state. A few normal short bursts have been detected by IBAS in 
October 2005 (note that SGR 1806-20 was not observed continuously during 
this period; the INTEGRAL observation log can be found at 
http://intweb.esac.esa.int/ ).

Burst times, approximate durations, and fluences (15-100 keV) measured 
with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument are reported below:

Date and  UT       Duration (s)    Fluence (erg cm-2)

2005-10-01T07:47:10   0.1               3E-8
2005-10-04T02:54:14   0.1               2E-8
2005-10-22T03:43:40   0.1               4E-8       
2005-10-22T07:25:37   0.38              9E-7
2005-10-22T08:52:42   0.07              2E-8 
2005-10-25T04:48:31   0.11              2E-8


The burst at 2005-10-22T08:52:42 was followed by a fainter peak 4.4 s 
later, lasting 0.04 s.

We remind that the occurrence of SGR 1806-20 bursts detected with high 
signal to noise ratio is reported in real time with IBAS Alert Packets. 
See http://ibas.mi.iasf.cnr.it/ for an uptated table of all the IBAS 
Alerts and for information on how to receive the Alert Packets for soft 
repeaters and type I bursters.
