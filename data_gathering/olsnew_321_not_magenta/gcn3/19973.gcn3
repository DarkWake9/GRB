report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:05:16.72 UT on 01 October 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 161001A (trigger 496976720 / 161001045) which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Page et al., GCN 19967).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.


The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 37
degrees.



The GBM light curve consists of a dominant pulse preceded by weaker emission
with a duration (T90) of about 2.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.1 s to T0+2.9 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.89 +/- 0.10 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 313 +/- 54 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.3 +/- 0.2)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.9 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
