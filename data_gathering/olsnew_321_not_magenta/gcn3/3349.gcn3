TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3349
SUBJECT: GRB050504: P60 Observations
DATE:    05/05/04 09:35:00 GMT

S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of GRB050504 (GCN 3348) with the automated
Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  Observations began at ~ 8:04 UT, 3 minutes
after the burst.  A coaddition of our first five Kron R band images (3 x
60 s, 2 x 120 s, mean epoch 8:14 UT), yields no new sources in the error
circle compared with the Digital Sky Survey.  Our limiting magnitude,
calculated with respect to several Guide Star Catalog sources in the
field, is approximately R > 21.0.  We note, however, the bright source
mentioned by Bloom & Prochaska (GCN 3347) affects our sensitivity over a
significant fraction of the error circle.

Further observations are planned.
