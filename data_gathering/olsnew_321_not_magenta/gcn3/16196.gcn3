We observed the region around GRB 140430A with the 1.8m Vatican Advanced
Technology Telescope (VATT) on 2014 May 1 (UT). With the VATT4K CCD we
obtained 5x120s exposures in the R-band centered around 03:22UT (408 mins
after the GRB). A source not seen in the Digitized Sky Survey is
well-detected at the coordinates reported by Malesani et al (GCN 16193).
Relative photometry was carried out using the same nearby star used by
Malesani et al. which has an R-band magnitude of R=15.13.

Our R-band magnitude for the GRB, 6.81 hours after the initial outburst,
is R=20.07 +- 0.03. Combining our results with the magnitude from GCN
16193 we estimate an optical power-law decay index of 0.76.
