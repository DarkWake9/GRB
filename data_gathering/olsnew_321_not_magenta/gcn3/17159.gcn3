K. L. Page (U Leicester) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 13:23:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 141212B (trigger=621234).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 250.869, +31.749 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 43m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 44' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a multiple-peak
structure with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 13:25:13.4 UT, 85.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Stamatikos (Michael.Stamatikos-1 AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
