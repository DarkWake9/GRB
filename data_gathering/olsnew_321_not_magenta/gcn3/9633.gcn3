on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:07:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090709B (trigger=356912).  Swift did not slew because
of Sun constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 93.593, +64.085, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 14m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 05' 07"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of at least 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position until 
18th July 2009. There will thus be no immediate XRT or UVOT data for 
this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
