E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and A. Boss (Carnegie DTM) reoprt:

"We imaged the error circle of GRB 051210 (GCNs 4318, 4320) with the du 
Pont 100-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in I-band for a total 
of 30 min starting on 2005 December 11.04 UT (19.2 hours after the burst).  
The images were obtained at an airmass of about 1.4 and an average seeing 
of about 0.8".  We do not detect any objects within the XRT error circle 
to an estimated 5-sigma limit of I>23 mag."
