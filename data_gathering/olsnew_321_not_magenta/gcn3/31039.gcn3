The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:46:10 UT on 4 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211104A (trigger 657744375.805276 / 211104782).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 16.9, Dec = 17.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 07m, 17d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 22.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 45.0 degrees.
