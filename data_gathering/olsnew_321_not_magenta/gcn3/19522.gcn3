D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL)
and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:40:34 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160611A (trigger=690598).  Swift did not slew due to an observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 164.438, -70.395, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 57m 45s
   Dec(J2000) = -70d 23' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks
with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+43.3
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Malesani (malesani AT dark-cosmology.dk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
