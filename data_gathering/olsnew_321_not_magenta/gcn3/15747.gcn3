A. Maselli (INAF-IASFPA), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and P. A. Evans (U. 
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

On 2014 January 15, Swift has returned to observe the field of the Fermi 
GRB 140110A (Bissaldi et al., GCN 15714; von Kienlin & Connaughton, GCN 
15716). Five uncatalogued X-ray sources were listed by Maselli et al. 
(GCN 15721) as a result of the analysis of seven tiled XRT observations 
(Evans, GCN 15715) carried out on January 10. According to Pal'shin et 
al. (GCN 15725), the position of just one of these sources (#7) is 
consistent with the IPN annulus.

During the XRT observation carried out on January 15, which started 455 
ks after the LAT trigger, the source #7 was detected at a mean count 
rate of 2.64 (+1.06, -0.84) x 10^-3 ct s^-1 which is consistent with the 
one [2.61 (+1.25, -0.95) x 10^-3 ct s^-1] corresponding to five days 
earlier. Consequently, this source is unlikely to be the afterglow of 
GRB 140110A. Further details of the XRT analysis carried out on the 
field of GRB 140110A are available at the following link:
