The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:09:59 UT on 11 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211211A (trigger 660921004.65092 / 211211549).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 211.3, Dec = 27.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 05m, 27d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 111.0 degrees.
