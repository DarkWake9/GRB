NUMBER:  1864
SUBJECT: GRB030115, WSRT radio observations
DATE:    03/02/13 13:58:36 GMT
FROM:    Evert Rol at U.Amsterdam  <evert@science.uva.nl>

E. Rol and R. Wijers (University of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 030115 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at three epochs. The results
are as follows:

  obs. date (UT 2003)        flux (mJy)
------------------------------------------
 Jan 16.8804 - 17.3866    0.062 +/- 0.032
 Jan 20.8696 - 21.3684    0.047 +/- 0.034
 Jan 26.8520 - 27.3520    0.072 +/- 0.026


A combined image results in a 4 sigma detection of 0.058 mJy at the
position of the afterglow.

Further observations are planned."
