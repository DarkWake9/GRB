report on behalf of the SVOM Multi Messenger Astronomy and GWAC teams
(http://www.svom.fr/en/svom-mma-and-gwac-team):

We observed 17 (~2550 square deg) sky regions to cover the skymap of the
advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S200115j  (GCN # 26759), with SVOM/GWAC,
at Xinglong Observatory. SVOM/GWAC is equipped with two sets of
wide angle cameras:
- FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera, aperture = 3.5 cm),
- JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera, aperture = 18 cm).

SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and 16 JFOV cameras,
working in the unfiltered band. The observations are operated in
time-series mode, taking one exposure every 25 seconds
(20s exposure + 5s readout). The observed and processed regions enclosed
an estimated 67.1% of the probability of the advanced LIGO/Virgo skymap.
Images were taken between ~7 hours and ~18 hours after the GW trigger
time. The coordinates of the 17 sky regions observed and
their observation times and covered probability are listed below:

The sky coverage map is available at:

(user:svomo3 pwd:gwo3).

Weather conditions were clear during the observations. The sky regions are
> 80 degrees from the moon (~0.72 of lunar phase). An average 3-sigma
limiting magnitude of 16 mag in the R band was obtained in the single
frames. No credible new source was detected by our online pipeline during
follow-up observations. A more detailed image analysis including
co-addition is ongoing with our offline pipeline to search for transient
candidates.
