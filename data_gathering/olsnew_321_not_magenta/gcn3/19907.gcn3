A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), L. Izzo (IAA-CSIC), 
D.A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg), V. Casanova (IAA-CSIC) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 160910A (Veres et al. GCN 19901, 
Racusin et al. GCN 19902, D’Aì et al. GCN 19904) with the 1.5m 
OSN telescope in Granada (Spain). The observation consisted of I-band 
imaging and started at 20:15:07 (26.92 hr after the burst). On the first 300 s
image we detect an object within the XRT error box at I(AB) ~ 19.3 mag, 
not present in the SDSS images, which we identify as the counterpart of 
GRB 160910A

We encourage further follow-up and spectroscopy of this bright afterglow.
