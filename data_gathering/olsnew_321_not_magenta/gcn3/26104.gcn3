The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:14:54 UT on 31 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191031B (trigger 594227699.816476 / 191031635).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 31.8, Dec = -14.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 07m, -14d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70.0 degrees.
