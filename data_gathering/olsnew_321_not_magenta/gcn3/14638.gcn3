S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, 
E.Filippova (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of 
the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 10 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:26:32 UT of May 14.

A preliminary analysis gives the coordinates (J2000)

R.A.=  147.604 deg
DEC.=  -18.969 deg

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (90% c.l.).


The burst had a peak flux of about 1 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time). Due to telemetry saturation we can only set a lower 
limit of 6x10^-7 erg/cmq on the fluence in the same energy range.

A plot of the light curve has been posted at
