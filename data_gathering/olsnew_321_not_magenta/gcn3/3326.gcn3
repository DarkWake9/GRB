J.S. Bloom (UCB) and C. Blake (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"The PAIRITEL 1.3m telescope began observations of GRB 050502 (GCN 3323)
during twilight, approximately 31 minutes after the burst. We confirm a
bright point source in our J,H,K images coincident with the location
reported by Yost et al. (GCN 3322). This source is below the 2MASS
detection limit. Observations and analysis are continuing."
