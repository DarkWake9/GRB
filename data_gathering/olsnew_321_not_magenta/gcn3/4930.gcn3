W.K. Zheng, M.Zhai, Y.L. Qiu, J.Y. Wei, J.Y. Hu and J.S. Deng, report on
behalf of the Xinglong GRB follow-up team:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060323A with the 0.8m telescope at Xinglong
Observatory.The first image was taken at 14:41:05 UT, approximately 540s
after the BAT trigger.Preliminary analyses reveal a clear object at the 
position reported in GCN 4911. The unfiltered brightness reached a peak of
about 18.2 mag about 640s after the trigger and showed a steady decay between
about 710s and 3300s. R-band magnitudes from USNO A2.0 were used to calibrate
our observations. We imaged the field again at Mar 25 12:15:54 UT,about 2 days
after the burst. No obvious source was detected at the same position up to a
3-sigma limit of about 20.2 mag. Further analysis is under progress.
