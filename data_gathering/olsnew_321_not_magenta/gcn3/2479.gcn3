J.X. Prochaska (UCO/Lick Observatory), H.W. Chen (MIT),
K. Hurley (UCB), J.S. Bloom (Harvard/CfA), J.R. Graham (UCB),
and W.D. Vacca (NASA/Ames) report:

The coordinates of the galaxy in GCN 2475 were given incorrectly.
The correct coordinates are:

RA = 08:02:30.18, Decl. =  -39:51:03.5

We regret any confusion that this error might have caused.
