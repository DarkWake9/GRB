S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B. Fox report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-
Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB050410 with the automated Palomar 60-inch
telescope.  Observations consisted of 10 x 120 second images each in the
Gunn i and z bands.  At a mean epoch of approximately 3:50 UT (15.6
hours after the burst), we find no evidence for any source in the XRT
error circle (GCN 3218).  Our limiting magnitudes, from comparison with
several stars in the USNO-B1 catalog, are approximately i < 21.5, z <
20.0.
