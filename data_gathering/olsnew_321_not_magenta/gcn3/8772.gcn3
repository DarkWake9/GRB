A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO), L. Blanco (IAC)
A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB090102 (Mangano et al.,
GCN 8762) from the IAC80 telescope at Izaña Observatory in
Tenerife (Spain). A 6x300s combined exposure with mean
epoch 2.92 Jan 2009 (19.2h after the burst) shows the afterglow
(Klotz et al., GCN 8761) with R=22.6+/-0.3, as compared to
stars of the UNSO-B1.0. This is consistent with the prediction
of Afonso et al. (GCN 8771) for day 1.
