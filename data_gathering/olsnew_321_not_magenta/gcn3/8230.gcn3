Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080915 (trigger #324744)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 8227).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 17.911, -76.042 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 11m 38.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -76d 02' 29.9" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 89%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like peak starting
at ~T-5 sec, peaking at ~T+4 sec and ending at ~T+25 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 14 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.2 to T+16.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.64 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.03 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
