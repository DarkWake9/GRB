behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the whole IPN field and its surrounding region of GRB
140219A (Hurley et al., GCN 15864). The first epoch was done at ~15:40
UT on 2014-02-20 using the 1m telescope located at Xuyi, Jiangsu,
China, equipped with a 3x3 deg^2 CCD camera. The second epoch was done
at ~17:50 UT on 2014-02-20 using the 1m telescope located at Nanshan,
Xinjiang, China, equipped with a 1.2x1.2 deg^2 CCD camera. For both
epochs, a series of R-band 120s exposures were obtained.

The depths of the images of the two epochs are largely comparable and
it has R~19 mag. Within the IPN field, we found two relatively bright
sources, but they can be ruled out to be an afterglow by cross
checking the Xuyi, Nanshan, and DSS images. A third epoch was done at
the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the NOT images confirm the
above ruling-out. Therefore, assuming GRB 140219A is a conventional
cosmological burst happening within the IPN field, its afterglow would
be fainter than R~19 mag at T~20 hrs post-burst, which is a possible
case according to previous GRB follow-ups. Inspection of some
surrounding region of the IPN field also leads to no credible
afterglow candidate detection.

For the reported two Swift/XRT sources in the central part of the IPN
field (Mangano et al., GCN 15872), S2 is not present in the Xuyi and
Nanshan images as well, while S1 is a known source.
