A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger
Caltech/NRAO/Carnegie collaboration:

"We have observed the error box of GRB 040812 (GCN 2640) with the Very
Large Array on 2004 August 14.15 UT (t ~ 2 days since burst).  At 8.5
GHz we detect a 0.45 mJy source at location:

       RA: 16:26:08.5	    Dec: -44:41:04.0   (J2000)

with a positional uncertainty of 8 arcsec (radius).  The source is
also detected at 4.9 GHz with a flux density of 0.79 mJy giving
a spectral index of beta ~ -1 between the two observing bands.
This spectral index is inconsistent with those measured for
early radio afterglows.

No other sources are detected within the error box with
a 2 sigma detection limit of 0.14 and 0.16 mJy at 4.9 and 8.5
GHz, respectively.

Further observations are planned."
