report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 140512A (Pagani et al. GCN 16249)
with the AlFOSC instrument on the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (La
Palma, Spain), as part of the Stockholm remote observing school.
Observations consisted of 3x300s imaging in R, starting at 02:10 UT
(6.65 hrs after the burst). Observations were performed under variable
seeing conditions of 2.0-2.5". Preliminary photometry, based on the
USNO-B1.0 catalogue yields R~19.5 mag. Spectroscopic observations
are ongoing.
