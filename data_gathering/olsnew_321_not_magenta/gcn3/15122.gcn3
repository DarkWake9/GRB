W. Fong, B. A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the field of the short-duration GRB 130822A (Kocevski et
al., GCN 15112) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
beginning on 2013 Aug 23.33 UT (15.9 hr post-burst) at a mean
frequency of 5.8 GHz. In 1 hour of observations, we do not detect any
radio source within or around the XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN
15117). We therefore place a 3-sigma limit of ~30 microJy on the radio
afterglow of GRB 130822A at 15.9 hr after the burst.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
