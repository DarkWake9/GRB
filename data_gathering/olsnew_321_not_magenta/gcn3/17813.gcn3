Younes G. (USRA at GWU) and Meegan C. (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:33:15.25  UT, on 2015 May 13, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150513A
(trigger 453241998 / 150513856) which was also detected
by Swift (Kocevski  et al. 2015, GCN 17810) and Fermi/LAT
(Kocevski et al. 2015, GCN 17812). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift position. The angle from the
Fermi LAT boresight is about 45 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two peaks separated by about 150 s
with a duration (T90) of 165 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-161.5 s to T0+4.3 s is well fit by a BAND function
with Epeak = 252 +/- 63 keV, alpha = -0.9 +/- 0.1, and
beta = -1.69 +/- 0.06.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.36 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1 second peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+0.2 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 4.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
