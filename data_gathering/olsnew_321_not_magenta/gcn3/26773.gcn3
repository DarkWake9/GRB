report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2020-01-14T03:40:45.50 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 200114A (trigger ID: HEB200114153) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Fermi/GBM (GCN #26735).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 30.02 s measured from T0-2.72 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0-0.57 s, is 1112 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 6070 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
