We observed the possible OTs for LIGO/Virgo G299232, one at/near NGC
1343 (MASTER
OT J033744.97+723159.0; GCN 21719), and the other one discovered by
SWIFT/UVOT (GCN 21733) with Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT). We detected OT
J033744.97+723159.0 and calibrated with respect to the APASS catalog.


Summary of the observations:


20170828 20:05:45 UT B 360s 17.32 +/- 0.01

20170828 20:00:15 UT V 300s 16.48 +/- 0.01


20170829 19:46:14 UT B 360s 17.19 +/- 0.01

20170829 19:52:30 UT V 300s 16.33 +/- 0.01


These magnitudes are on the Vega system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the OT.


The second OT was observed once and we did not have any detection at the
reported location (which confirms the follow-up announcements in GCN 21754
and 21757).


We thank the staff of the Lulin observatory in Taiwan.
