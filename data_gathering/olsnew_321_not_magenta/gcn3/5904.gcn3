M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 12:20:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061210 (trigger=243690).  Swift did not slew because
of the Moon observing constraint -- this burst is 4 deg from the Moon. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 144.514, +15.632 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 38m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 37' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
structure with a duration of about 0.8 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~27,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

No XRT or UVOT observations will be possible until the burst 
emerges from the spacecraft Moon constraint in about 1.5 days.
