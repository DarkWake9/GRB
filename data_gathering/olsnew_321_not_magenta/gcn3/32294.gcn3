T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) report on behalf of the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:26:58 UT on 29 June 2022, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
triggered and located MAXI J0655-013 (trigger=1113743).  Swift did
not slew to this source as Sun constraint currently prevents the 
UVOT and XRT from pointing at this location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 103.786, -1.493 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 55m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -01d 29' 33"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, there
is no obvious variation in the immediately available BAT lightcurve. 

This source has continued to be in outburst and is continuing to
rise, with high variability, since its earliest detection and
identification as a Galactic transient.  (Serino et al. ATel#15442)

BAT has detected this source in its on-board imaging ~250 times, with
an average position of ra,dec = 103.798, -1.495 (uncertainty
less than 1 arcminute).
