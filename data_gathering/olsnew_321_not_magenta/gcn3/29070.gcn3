report:

The 25cm robotic telescope FRAM-ORM at La Palma (Spain) reacted robotically
to the alert of GRB201216C (Beardmore et al GCNC 29061, Fermi/GBM team GCNC
29063, Campana et al. GCNC 29064 and Osborne et al. GCNC 29067), obtaining
a series of 20s unfiltered images starting at 23:08:04.3 UT, i.e. 31.6s
post trigger.

We clearly detect the source reported by Izzo et al. (GCNC 29066) at the
VLT. The observations by FRAM cover the onset of the afterglow and its
peak. The joint fit of our final points from ~1ks post trigger and the VLT
point provide a power-law decay rate of ~1.07, all of these confirm the
afterglow nature of the transient and provide an extrapolation of the
brightness to r~24.6 for the next night.
