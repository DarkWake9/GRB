K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at 75986
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 5
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  5.0E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 152.163, 32.665 degrees, whose radius is 30.786 +/-  0.099
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
