SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S200225q: Identification of a GW compact binary merger candidate The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S200225q during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2020-02-25 06:04:21.397 UTC (GPS time:
1266645879.397). The candidate was found by the PyCBC Live [1],
CWB [2], MBTAOnline [3], GstLAL [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.

S200225q is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 9.2e-09 Hz, or about one in 3
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:
https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200225q

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (96%), Terrestrial (4%), BNS (<1%), NSBH
(<1%), or MassGap (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability
that the lighter compact object has a mass < 3 solar masses (HasNS) is
<1%. Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the
probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is
<1%.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 3 minutes after the candidate
event time.
 * bayestar.fits.gz,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 11 minutes after the candidate
event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.fits.gz,1. For the
bayestar.fits.gz,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 668 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 1234 +/- 341 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).
