SUBJECT: GRB 071010B: Independent Confirmation of Break

FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

  M. Im, I. Lee (Seoul National University), and Y. Urata
  (Saitama University) on behalf of the EAFON team:

   Using the Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) 1.0m telescope
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute,
  we continued our observation of GRB071010B (GCN 6871,
  Markwardt et al.), beginning at 10:53:09 UT on Oct 16,
  (5.58 days after the trigger), and at 10:54:39 on Oct 19
  (8.58 days after the trigger).
   These observations reveal the optical afterglows again
  (GCN 6873, Oksanen et al.), and the Oct. 19 data confirms
  the break in the light curve reported earlier (GCN6935,
  Kann et al.).
   On the other hand, our Oct 16 photometry suggests that
  the break started around Oct. 16 or later.

   Photometry of the object is given below.
