The La Silla-QUEST survey operating the 10-sq-deg QUEST camera on the 
1.0m ESO Schmidt at La Silla, Chile is continuing coverage begun 2015 
Dec 28 of the ~90% confidence area for LVC event G21117 between Dec +27 
and -13 deg.  Two new candidates have been detected with high 
confidence, verified from observations made Dec 30

LSQ15bwe    19.2 36.509181 17.06122 2457386.6243
LSQ15bwd    17.0 39.661939 16.61666 2457386.6243

LSQ15bwe appears as a likely supernova 0.22 arcmin north-west of galaxy 
2MASX J02260249+1703274i. The brightness has not changed significantly 
between 2015 Dec 28 and 30, indicating a likely onset prior to the 
G21117 event.

LSQ15bdw is coincident with QSO [HB89] 0235+164 which has readshift z = 
0.85. The source  brightened from V = 18.2 to 17.6 between 2015 Dec 28 
and 30 and is 1.5 to 2.0 mags brighter than its appearance in previous 
epochs (2012, 2013, 2014).
