and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 161010A (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 20021; Svinkin et al.,
GCN Circ. 20027; McCauley et al., GCN Circ. 20025) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 13:36:31.69 on 10 October 2016.
The burst signal was seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single weak peak starting at T0, peaking at
T+3 sec and ending at T+8 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data
is 4.9 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
