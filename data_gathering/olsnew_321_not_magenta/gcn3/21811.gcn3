(UBAI), O. Burhonov (UBAI)  report on behalf of IKI-GW follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of the Optical Transient discovered by Swift/UVOT 
(Emery et al., GCN 21733)  with  AZT-22 telescope of Maidanak 
observatory starting on 2017-08-28 (UT) 21:25:37. We obtained several 
images in R-filter.  The optical transient (Emery et al., GCN 21733) is 
not detected in a combined image.  Preliminary  photometry of the field 
is following.
