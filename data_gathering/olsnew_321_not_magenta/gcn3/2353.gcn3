S. Golenetskii, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks (all Ioffe PTI),
and T. Cline (NASA GSFC) on behalf of the Konus GRB team, report:

Konus - Wind also observed this burst (GCN 2351) at 09:52:01.888
It has a duration of 0.1s and fluence 9x10-7 erg cm-2 (15-200 keV).

The only evidence that the burst is not from SGR1806-20 is its
hardness ratio N(71 - 280 kev)/N(18.7 - 71 kev) = (0.24 +/- 0.03).
An average value for SGR1806-20 bursts detected by Konus-Wind
during 1996-2003 is (0.12 +/- 0.01) for the same energy intervals.
