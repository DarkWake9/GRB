Daniele Malesani and Johan Peter Uldall Fynbo report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 090407 (Ziaeepour et al., GCN 9101) with 
the ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Observations were carried out with mean 
time Apr 8.0 UT (13.7 hr after the GRB), partially during evening twilight.

Inside the X-ray error circle (Evans et al., GCN 9105), no source is 
detected down to limiting magnitudes R > 23.8 and z(AB) > 23.8, based on 
archival zeropoints (accurate up to ~0.2 mag).

We encourage deeper observations, possibly in the near infrared.

We acknowledge significant support from the ESO staff at Paranal, in 
particular Gianni Marconi and Elena Mason.
