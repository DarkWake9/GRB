SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S190602aq: Identification of a GW compact binary merger candidate

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S190602aq during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-06-02
17:59:27.089 UTC (GPS time: 1243533585.089). The candidate was found
by the PyCBC Live [1], CWB [2], SPIIR [3], GstLAL [4], and MBTAOnline
[5] analysis pipelines.

S190602aq is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-09 Hz, or about one in 16
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190602aq

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), NSBH (<1%),
or MassGap (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong
evidence against the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar
masses (HasNS: <1%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the
signal, there is strong evidence against matter outside the final
compact object (HasRemnant: <1%).

One skymap is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR
[6], distributed via GCN notice about 6 minutes after the candidate

For the bayestar.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 1172 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 797 +/- 238 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).
