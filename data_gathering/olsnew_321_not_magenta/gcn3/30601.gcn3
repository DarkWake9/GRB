The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:36:42 UT on 7 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210807B (trigger 650032607.844228 / 210807525).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 256.2, Dec = -32.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 04m, -32d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
