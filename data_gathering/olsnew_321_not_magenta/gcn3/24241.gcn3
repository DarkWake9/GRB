MASTER Global Robotic Net (http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 
2010,Advances in Astronomy,vol. 2010, 30L)
started  LIGO/Virgo S190425z (Singer et al. GCN 24168)
inspection at 2019-04-25 09:10:18 UT (Lipunov et al. GCN 24167) at 
MASTER-OAFA (Argentina).

MASTER-OAFA started PS19qp (Smith et al., GCN 24210 ) at  2019-04-26 
01:56:40.

         Looking at our old images AT2019ebq / PS19qp, we 
found a very recent inspection of this field due to the neutrino BNO alert 
3 weeks ago and automatical Circular (not published yet).

To establish a possible connection of this supernova with neutrinos, it is 
extremely important to determine the age of the supernova AT2019ebq / 
PS19qp . Thus the object is not associated with LIGO/Virgo S190425z but 
may be connected with BNO Alert190405.62 .

Below you can find automatic Circular (not published yet):

MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, Kislovodsk Solar 
Station of Pulkovo observatory) was pointed to the  BAKSAN Alert190405.62 
( 17h 25m 36.00s , - 2d 36m 00.00s, R=3) 19864 sec after trigger time at 
2019-04-05 20:29:29 UT, with upper limit up to  19.2 mag. The observations 
began at zenit distance = 83 deg. The sun  altitude  is -39.9 deg.

MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, SAI 
Crimea astronomical station) was pointed to the  BAKSAN Alert190405.62 
28940 sec after trigger time at 2019-04-05 23:00:45 UT, with upper limit 
up to  19.1 mag. The observations began at zenit distance = 63 deg. The 
sun  altitude  is -37.1 deg.

MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  located in South Africa (South African 
Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the  BAKSAN Alert190405.62 1 days 
39324 sec after trigger time at 2019-04-07 01:53:49 UT, with upper limit 
up to  19.2 mag. The observations began at zenit distance = 34 deg. The 
sun  altitude  is -38.5 deg.

MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope  located in Argentina (OAFA observatory of 
San Juan National University) was pointed to the  BAKSAN Alert190405.62 1 
days 54872 sec after trigger time at 2019-04-07 06:12:57 UT, with upper 
limit up to  18.0 mag. The observations began at zenit distance = 49 deg. 
The sun  altitude  is -56.9 deg.

The galactic latitude b = -60 deg., longitude l = 98 deg.

The follow up spectral and photometric observations of AT2019ebq/PS19qp 
are required.
