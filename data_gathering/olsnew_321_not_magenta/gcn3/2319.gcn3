TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2319
SUBJECT: XRF030723, BVRcIc field photometry correction
DATE:    03/07/24 20:05:06 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

After reinspection of the data, it was found that the photometric
calibration field center is not at the SXC coordinates, but rather
20 timesec (=267 arcsec) to the east due to operator error.
The SXC localization center is present in the dataset, but the
western part of the error circle was missed.  We apologize for
the miscentering.
