We observed PS19qp (Smith et al., GCN 24210) a potential counterpart to the gravitational wave trigger S190425z (GCN 24168), under the advanced Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (ePESSTO+; see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40 http://www.pessto.org). The observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla with the EFOSC2 instrument.

The transient is coincident with a probable host galaxy 2MASS J17011849-0700102. Preliminary reduction of our NTT spectrum (1800s, Grism#13) shows a red and mostly featureless continuum, with a narrow H-alpha emission line, likely from the host galaxy, at z=0.037.

With this redshift and a foreground extinction of A_v = 1.3 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011), the apparent magnitude of i=20.4 mag reported by Smith et al. corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -16.7. Further observations are in progress.
