At 18:57:15 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB050827 (trigger=152325).
The spacecraft did not slew because of Moon constraint, and it will not be
observable until ~13:00 UT 28/Aug/05 (T+18 hrs).  The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA,Dec 64.279d,+18.218d {04h 17m 07s,+18d 13' 03"}
(J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows multi-peaks with some pre-trigger emission
starting at T-10 sec with a total duration of ~45 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 seconds after the trigger.
