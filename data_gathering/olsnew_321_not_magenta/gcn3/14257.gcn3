J. R. Cummings (NASA/GSFC UMBC/CRESST) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf
of the Swift/BAT team:

At 11:39:16, BAT triggered on GRB 130305A (trigger #550329).  No source was
found on board.  This burst was also detected by Fermi (trignum=384176354)
and INTEGRAL (TRIGGER_NUM:    6794,   Sub_Num: 0).  In ground analysis of the
BAT scaled-map data, a significant source was found on the edge of the BAT
FOV (2.25% coded) at RA, Dec 116.765, +52.025, which is:

RA (J2000)  07h 47m 03.6s 	
Dec (J2000) 52d 01m 29s

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 3.5 arcmin.

The GRB was a single symmetrical peak about 20 seconds long.  A Swift TOO request
has been approved to detect the afterglow position.
