S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 21:14:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
likely 1RXS J180408.9-342058 (trigger=629206).  Swift did not slew
because of Sun observing constraint. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 271.033, -34.312 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 04m 08s
   Dec(J2000) = -34d 18' 42"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers (20 mins),
the BAT light curve shows nothing in the TDRSS real-time light curve. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 00:23 UT on 2015 February 06. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time.
