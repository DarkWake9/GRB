We observed the field of GRB200306C (Gropp et al., GCN 27326) with the 0.5m
Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 03-07-2020 starting at 01:52:04 UT (T+3.0
hrs). We performed a series of exposures in R filter. The weather
conditions were clear during the hours of observation and the zenith angle
at the start of observations was 68 degrees and rising. We observed the
Swift XRT position with a 20'x20' field of view.

We find no new source at the position of previous optical
detections (Lipunov et al., GCN 27325, Jelinek et al., GCN 27328,
Castro-Tirado et al., GCN 27329, Moskvitin et al., GCN 27333, Izzo et al.,
GCN 27334, Kann et al., 27335) and report upper limits as follows:

T_mid       ||Exposure     ||Filter      ||Limit
T+3.3 hrs      ||1025s          ||R           ||18.0
T+4.0 hrs      ||3360s          ||R           ||19.0

The limits are estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and are
not corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the
commissioning phase.
