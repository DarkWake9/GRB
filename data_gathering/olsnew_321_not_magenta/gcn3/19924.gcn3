Using the data set from T-239 to T+959 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160912A (trigger #711914)
(Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circ. 19912).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 301.595, 57.585 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  20h 06m 22.7s
  Dec(J2000) = +57d 35' 04.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows some weak emissions that starts at ~ T-33 s,
and a FRED-like pulse from ~T+140 s to ~T+200 s. We do not have much
information of the burst emission afterwards due to some large gaps in the data
after ~T+320 s.

The time-averaged spectrum using the available data from T-33 to T+211 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.43 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+148.56 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
