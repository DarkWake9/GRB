We analysed 12.1 ks of data in Photon Counting (PC) mode obtained for GRB
080703 (Ziaeepour et al., GCN Circ 7936) between 106 s and 3.1e4s after the
trigger (T0). The UVOT-enhanced XRT position was given by Osborne et al. in
GCN Circ. 7939.

The X-ray light-curve shows an initial rise from T0+106s to ~T0+200s and
then
decays with a slope of ~1.2. From ~T0+700s to ~T0+2000s, the XRT light-curve
shows some flaring activities. The light-curve after ~T0+1e4s decays with a
slope of 1.57 +/-0.21.

The hardness ratio does not show any significant spectral variation from
T0+106s to T0+3.1e4s. The PC spectrum from T0+106s to T0+3.1e4s is well
fitted
by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.7 +/-0.1 and an absorption
column of (8.9 +3.9/-3.3)e20 cm**-2, in excess with respect to the Galactic
one (5.2e20 cm**-2; Kalberla et al. 2005). The observed 0.3-10 keV flux over
this time interval is (8.2 +0.8/-1.2)e-12 erg/cm**2/s.

If the light-curve continues to decay with alpha = 1.6, the count rate at 24
hours after the trigger is estimated to be 7e-3 counts/s, which
corresponds to
an observed flux of 6.7e-13 erg/cm**2/s.
