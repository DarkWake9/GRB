on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m telescope Faulkes Telescope North in Hawaii began observing
Swift GRB 140903A (Cummings et al. GCN Circ 16763) on September 04
at 06:35:20 UT, i.e. ~15.6 hours after the BAT trigger, with
the r' and i' filters.
We detect the optical source reported by Capone et al. (GCN 16769),
Cenko et al. (GCN 16770), Fruchter (GCN 16776) within an estimated
magnitude of r'=20.4 +- 0.5.
Given the measured values and relatively large uncertainties,
nothing can be inferred on the possible fading.
