The bright, long burst, GRB 061202 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 5886; 5887),
triggered the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM),
which covers the energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV, at 08:12:59.625 (UT).
A FRED type peak and following weak and broad hump were seen in the 
 WAM light curve. The T90 duration was about 64 seconds. The fluence 
in 100 - 500 keV was (5.0 +- 0.6)x10^-6 erg/cm2, while the 1-s peak
flux was 0.80 +- 0.05 photons/cm2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the spectrum of the main peak, integrated
during T0 to T0+50s is well-described with a single power-law model with 
the photon index of 1.78 (-0.22, +0.21). All the quoted errors are at 
statistical 90% confidence level, while systematic errors are not included.
