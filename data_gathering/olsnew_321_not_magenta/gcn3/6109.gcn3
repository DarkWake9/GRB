Using the data set from T-239.9 to T+499.2 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070219
(trigger #261132)  (Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 6104).  The BAT 
ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 260.219, 69.345 deg which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 20m 52.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 69d 20' 41.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 92%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a weak FRED-like bump from T-4 to T+20 sec.  
T90 (15-350 keV) is 17 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.5 to T+17.7 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.8 +- 0.2.  
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.31 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
