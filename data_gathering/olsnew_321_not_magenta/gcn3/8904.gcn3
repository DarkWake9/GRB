report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:39:25.46 UT on 13 February 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090213 (trigger 256196367 / 090213236).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 327.0, Dec = -53.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 
J2000 21h 48m, -53d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally 
a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17 degrees.

Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly 
constrained."
