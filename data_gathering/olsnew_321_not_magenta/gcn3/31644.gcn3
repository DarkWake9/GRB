Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and P.A.
Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of GRB 220219B (Svinkin
et al., GCN Circ. 31624), collecting 3.5 ks of Photon Counting (PC)
mode data between T0+322.5 ks and T0+369.3 ks. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected at a position
consistent with the GRB optical afterglow candidate
ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva (Ho et al., GCN Circ. 31619). The X-ray source 
is below the RASS limit and shows no definitive signs of fading.
Details of this source are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  240.91414  =  16:03:39.39
  Dec (J2000.0): +31.23404  =  +31:14:02.5
  Error: 2.8 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: 0.0250 [+0.0032, -0.0031] ct s^-1   
  Flux: (1.06 [+0.14, -0.13])e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
