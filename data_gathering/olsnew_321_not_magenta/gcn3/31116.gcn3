on behalf of the Swift-BAT team,  report:

The short-duration GRB 211124A
(Swift/BAT-GUANO detection: DeLaunay et al., GCN Circ. 31113)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 659413798),
Swift (BAT), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind in the waiting mode,
so far, at about 8994 s UT (02:29:54).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ----------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg    Dec(2000), deg
  ----------------------------------
  Center:
   85.2              -59.2
  Corners:
   22.5              -32.8
   18.6              -46.6
   85.9              -76.2
  129.3              -71.6
  ----------------------------------
The error box area is about 736 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 64 deg (the minimum one is 12.5 deg).
The Sun distance was about 96 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi final position and BALROG 
(https://grb.mpe.mpg.de/grb/GRB211124104/) localizations.
