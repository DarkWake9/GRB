on behalf of the Kanazawa team report: 

 We have observed the field of GRB 060105 (Ziaeepour et al. GCN #4429) 
with J, H, Ks-bands using the 1.3m telescope on the roof top of
ISAS, Japan. The observation was started at 08:37 UT (1.8 hours after 
the burst) in poor condition and low elevation. 
Comparison with the 2MASS catalogue does not reveal any new source
within the position of the XRT error circle. The 5-sigma upper limit 
magnitudes are Ks: 13.8,  H: 14.2, J: 15.7, respectively.
