B. Monard (Bronberg Obs.) reports on behalf of the AAVSO
International GRB network:

Observations of the HETE XRF/GRB030723 (triger 2777) error circle
were made with the Bronberg 0.30m telescope + unfiltered CCD.
Ten 45-second exposures with UT midpoint of 030723.806 (12.9hrs
after the burst) were stacked, with a limiting magnitude
of 20.5CR (based on USNO-A red magnitudes).  No new object
is seen down to approximately CR=20.0 when comparing against
a DSS2-red image.

  The AAVSO International GRB network is greatful for a generous grant from
the Curry Foundation and to NASA for the financial support for the High
Energy Workshops for Amateur Astronomers.
