The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:07:48 UT on 11 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220211A (trigger 666234473.877152 / 220211047).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 207.2, Dec = 40.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 48m, 40d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 145.0 degrees.
