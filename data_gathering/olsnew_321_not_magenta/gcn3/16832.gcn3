SUBJECT: GRB 140919A: Swift-XRT observations

report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 140919A at 16:07:15.9 UT,
3120.4 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 221.53822,
-32.17586 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 14h 46m 09.17s
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 10' 33.1"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 95 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 7.65
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
