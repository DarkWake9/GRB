A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

E. Bozzo, and C. Ferrigno,
on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The very bright, long-duration GRB 220308A
has been detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Fermi (GBM), Swift (BAT), and AGILE (MCAL),
so far, at about 20588 s UT (05:43:08).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   356.500 (23h 46m 00s) +23.844 (+23d 50' 40")
  Corners:
   358.094 (23h 52m 23s) +22.701 (+22d 42' 02")
   355.336 (23h 41m 21s) +25.088 (+25d 05' 19")
   354.810 (23h 39m 15s) +24.953 (+24d 57' 11")
   357.591 (23h 50m 22s) +22.579 (+22d 34' 45")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.44 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 3.75 deg (the minimum one is 25 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 30 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
