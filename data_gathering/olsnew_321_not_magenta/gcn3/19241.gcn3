E. Mazaeva (IKI),  A. Volnova (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP),  I. Korobtsev 
(ISTP),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 160327A (Racusin et al., GCN  19235) 
with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy)  starting on March, 
27 (UT) 13:48:49.  We do not detect any source within enhanced Swift-XRT 
position (Goad et al., GCN 19237). In particular we do not detect the 
source reported in GCN 19236 and it could confirm the source (Zach 
Golkhou et al., GCN 19236) is an afterglow of the  GRB 160327A. 
Preliminary photometry  of  the combined image is following

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars, Lupton transformations 
into R.
