Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA) on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift trigger of GRB 201029A (Dichiara et al., GCNC 28803), the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, automatically responded to this burst at 8 degrees above the horizon. Series images were taken started 20:21:26UT (~96 s after trigger). In the co-added of following images, no source is detected within the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCNC 28806) which down to 17.7 mag (clear filter), which consistent with the non-detections reported by UVOT (Dichiara et al., GCNC 2828803) and FRAM-ORM (Jelinek et al., GCNC 28805).

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA for their excellent support.
