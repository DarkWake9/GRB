Y.-D. Hu, F. Aceituno and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on 
behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 180614A by Swift (Gropp et al. GCNC 
22780), optical images in the I-band were obtained at the 1.5m OSN 
telescope in Granada (Spain) starting at 01:57 (Jun 15), i.e. 6.67 h 
postburst. No optical afterglow is detected in the co-added image (9 x 
600s, mid time 02:43 UT, 7.4 h after the trigger) within the enhanced 
Swift/XRT error box (Beardmore et al. GCNC 22782) down to I=21.0.
