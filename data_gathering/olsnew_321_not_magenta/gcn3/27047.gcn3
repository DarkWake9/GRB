V. Bhalerao (IITB), V. Karambelkar (Caltech) report on behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We cross-matched the IceCube neutrino candidate (IceCube collaboration, GCN 27043) with the NED galaxies list (Cook et al., GCN 27044) and the possible host galaxy list from Evans (GCN 27045). We find that the following sixteen galaxies from the NED list are within a three-sigma (1.29 degree) radius of the neutrino event. Galaxies from the Evans list are not consistent with the neutrino.

In particular, the last few galaxies are at a distance close to the median GW distance for S200213t. Further follow-up is encouraged.
