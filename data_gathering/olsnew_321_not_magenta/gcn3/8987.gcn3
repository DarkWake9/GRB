P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift has performed follow-up observations of the BAT Slew Survey GRB
090306B (Copete et al, GCN Circ. 8944), gathering 4 ks of data in the
interval T0+484 ks to T0+555 ks. The X-ray source reported by Evans et
al. (GCN Circ 8947) is no longer detected, with a 3-sigma upper limit of
1.9e-3  counts/sec. We thus confirm that it was the afterglow of GRB
090306B.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
