A. N. Morgan, S. B. Cenko, J. S. Bloom, (UC Berkeley), report:

We observed the field of GRB 100111A (Vetere et al., GCN 10317) with
the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began
at 2010-01-11 12:20:11 UT, ~8.12 hours after the Swift trigger.
Observations were taken under good weather conditions but at high
airmass before dawn.  In mosaics (effective exposure time of ~2223
seconds) taken simultaneously in the J, H, and Ks filters, we do not
detect the optical afterglow (Vetere et al., GCN 10317; Xu et al., GCN
10318; Hoversten et al., GCN 10323).

The preliminary photometry yields:

post_burst
t_mid(h)    exp(s)  filt    U. Limit (3 sig)
8.60        2223    J       > 19.0
8.60        2223    H       > 18.5
8.60        2223    Ks      > 18.0

All magnitudes given in the Vega system, calibrated to 2MASS.  No
correction for Galactic extinction has been made to the above reported
values.
