on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-5/JGT robotic telescope at Observatorio Astronomico
Nacional in San Pedro Martir (Mexico) automatically responded to the
Swift trigger of GRB 190613B (D'Ai et al., GCNC 24807). The first image
(1s exposure, clear-filter) was obtained at 10:48:04.16 UT (i.e. 62s
post-burst). We detect the optical afterglow at the position reported
by Swift (Beardmore et al. GCNC 24812, Marshall et al. GCNC 24817)
with R = 16.1. A sequence of images was obtained and the analysis is on
going. The magnitude is calibrated against the USNO-B1 catalog and is
not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff at Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro
Martir for its excellent support.
