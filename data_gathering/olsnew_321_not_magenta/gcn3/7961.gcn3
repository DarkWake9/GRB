P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The UVOT began observing the field of GRB 080710 3138.2s after the BAT 
trigger. A single white band finding chart was downlinked promptly, and 
a bright, uncatalogued source with magnitude wh = 16.88+/-0.02 is 
detected at
	RA  =  00:33:05.67   = 8.27363
	Dec = +19:30:04.69 = 19.50130
with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcseconds (90% confidence), consistent with 
the XRT position (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 7958) and KAIT position 
(Chornock et al., GCN 7959).

The value quoted above has not been corrected for the expected Galactic 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.08 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
