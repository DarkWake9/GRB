behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and Mars Odyssey-HEND observed this burst
at 12627 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  20
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  7.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is ~150. sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  14 h 21 m 35.25 s    -55 o 45 '  41.76 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 14 h 21 m 48.16 s    -55 o 37 '  57.10 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 14 h 21 m 22.31 s    -55 o 53 '  26.38 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 14 h 20 m 55.35 s    -55 o 43 '  45.23 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 14 h 22 m 26.03 s    -55 o 33 '  46.26 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 14 h 22 m 22.65 s    -55 o 38 '  05.81 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 14 h 20 m 47.59 s    -55 o 53 '  16.88 "

This error box may be improved.

A map will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020706.  Note
that a somewhat larger, four-sided error box was circulated in the GCN
socket message, for reasons related to the formatting of those
messages.  The above, smaller error box is the more precise one. The
Konus ecliptic latitude response has been used to distinguish between
the two possible error boxes in this 3-spacecraft triangulation.  There
is a very small chance that the alternate error box could in fact be
the correct one; we are now attempting to obtain more data to confirm
this triangulation.
