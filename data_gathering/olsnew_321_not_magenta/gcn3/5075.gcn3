D. Fugazza (INAF/OABr), D. Malesani (SISSA), G. Chincarini (Univ. 
Milano-Bicocca & INAF/OABr), S. Covino, P. Romano, G. Tagliaferri 
(INAF/OABr), M. Della Valle (INAF/OAA), N. Masetti (INAF/IASF Bo), G. 
Andreuzzi, N. Pinilla Alonso (INAF/TNG), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060428B (Campana et al., GCN 5017; Troja et 
al., GCN 5031), possibly an X-ray flash (Sakamoto et al., GCN 5029). We 
undertook spectroscopy of the object 3" close to the optical afterglow 
(Price et al., GCN 5019; Li et al., GCN 5027; Halpern & Mirabal, GCN 
5034), considering it as a potential host galaxy. Low-resolution 
spectroscopy (~15 A FWHM) was obtained with TNG+DOLoRes, starting on 
2005 May 3.89273, for a total exposure time of 1 hr.

Inspection of the spectrum reveals a smooth, very red continuum. No 
prominent features were detected either in emission or in absorption. We 
thus consider unlikely that this object is the host galaxy of GRB 060428B.
