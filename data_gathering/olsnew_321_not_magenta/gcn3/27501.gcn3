R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift/BAT-GUANO GRB 200405B (DeLaunay et al., GCN 27497) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the Siding Spring Observatory, Australia site, on April 6, from 08:49 to 09:29 UT (corresponding to 28.9 to 29.6 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel I and R filters.

We performed a series of 5x240s exposures in I and R. We do not detect any fading sources in the individual frames (or in stacked images).  We also do not detect any optical counterparts to the 4 potential Swift XRT candidates (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 27500).  Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper limits:

R > 21.75

I > 20.86

These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.
