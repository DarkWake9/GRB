With reference to the observation of our previous report (Guidorzi et 
al. GCN 22949), within the XRT error circles of the five X-ray sources 
(Kennea et al. GCN 22953) we found no uncatalogued source down to 
r'>20.0 mag at a mid time of 0.28 hours after the GRB trigger time 
(5x120s exposure), as calibrated against nearby SDSS objects.
