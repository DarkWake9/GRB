We observed the field of GRB 140430A detected by Swift (trigger #597722; 
Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 16190) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T16 (15 cm Takahashi TOA-150) telescope located at the AstroCamp Observatory 
(Nerpio, Spain).  

Due to the elevation constraint, we were able to collect only 4 images of 60 sec 
exposures in the R filter starting from April 30 20:46:42 (UT) about 13 minutes 
after the trigger and stopped on April 30 20:52:42 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow 
both in the individual images and the stacked image at the reported optical 
afterglow position (Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 16190; Malesani et al., GCN Circ. 16193).  
The estimated five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 240 sec) 
is ~18.6 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
