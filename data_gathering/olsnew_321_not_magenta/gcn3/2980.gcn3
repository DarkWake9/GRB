A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"On 2005 January 24.14 UT we carried out follow-up observations with the
VLA centered on the refined XRT position (GCN#2955) of the Swift burst,
GRB 050117A (GCN #2952 and 2962). At a frequency of 8.46 GHz no emission
was detected above a 2-sigma level of 56 microJy within the 30-arcsec
(diameter) error circle.

No further observations are planned."
