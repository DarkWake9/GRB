Starting on 2019 May 10 22:56 UTC, we observed the high-probability region of the LALInference skymap of gravitational wave source S190510g (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration, GCN #24448) using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Victor M. Blanco 4m Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile, continuing the observations described in Andreoni et al. (2019; GCN #24443). We covered 78.9 deg^2 of the localization region and 66% of the probability in the r and z filters to average limiting magnitudes of 23.1 (r-band) and 21.9 (z-band), obtaining 1 epoch in z and 1 in r. We obtained g-band for roughly 85% of the fields to a limiting magnitude of 22.9. We performed difference imaging in real-time using an automated  pipeline we developed for gravitational wave counterpart searches, taking reference images from the Dark Energy Survey and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, covering 100% of the observed area.

Below is a preliminary list of interesting candidates based on our real-time pipeline. Each candidate has at least two detections in two different filters and a prominent host galaxy.

We note that the host of DG19llhk is at z=0.07, consistent with the current LVC distance estimate. At this distance, the absolute magnitude would be -16.4, consistent with GW170817 at +1 day. We also note that the colors of DG19lcnl appear consistent with GW170817, but we do not have a host redshift. However, we caution that we do not have any constraints on the light curve history and hence, the phase of this event. We strongly encourage spectroscopic follow-up to classify these transients. 

We thank the CTIO staff, Steve Heathcote, Kathy Vivas, Tim Abbott, for facilitating these Target of Opportunity observations.
