and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170412A (Fermi GBM trigger #513733380;
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7811) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 23:42:54.53 on 12 April 2017.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak starting at T0 sec,
peaking at T+3 sec and ending at T+35 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 28.5 +- 1.2 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
