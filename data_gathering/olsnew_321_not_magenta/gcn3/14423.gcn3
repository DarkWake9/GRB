X.-H. Zhao (YNAO and PSU), J. Mao (RIKEN and YNAO), J.-M. Bai
(YNAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130420B (Page et al., GCN 14421; Oates et al., GCN 14411) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope. Observations
started at 13:21:14 UT on 2013-04-20 (i.e., 0.4 hrs after the burst). The observations lasted for ~10min. The afterglow was not found at
the XRT position, down to a upper limit of R>22.6.

We thank the GMG staff, especially Yu-Xin Xin, Gui-Hua He and Jian-Duo He for
performing these observations.
