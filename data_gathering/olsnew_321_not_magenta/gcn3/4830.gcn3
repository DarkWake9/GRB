C. Rodgers (U of Wyoming), D. Allen (U of Wyoming), Marc Herman (U of
Wyoming), R. Rodgers (ACSD#1), R. Canterna (U of Wyoming) report on behalf
of the Red Buttes Observatory (0.6m) GRB Team as part of the FUN GRB
Collaboration.

We responded to the rebrightening of GRB 060218/SN 2006aj at the position
reported by Kennea et al. (GCN 4776) at 2006/02/25 01:47:07 UT.  We took
10 minute exposures in BVRI over 4 different epochs.  The data are presented
below in magnitudes with a S/N > 14.0.  Each of the BRI magnitudes were
obtained using the USNO B1.0 catalog, and the V magntudes were determined
from Cool et al. (GCN 4777) SDSS g and r data by using Smith et al. (2002)
transformation equations.
