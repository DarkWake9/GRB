report on behalf of the INTEGRAL Gravitational Wave Team

We have analyzed INTEGRAL archival data of the SPI-ACS and IBIS/PICsIT
in coincidence with GRB150101B (GCN 17267, GCN 17276). Troja et al.
(2018, arXiv:1806.10624) suggest that GRB150101B is a kilonova event
comparable to GW170817/GRB170817A, but at cosmological distance and
without the observations of a gravitational-wave trigger. The INTEGRAL
orientation was 24.9 degrees from the GRB location and implies a
somewhat suppressed response for SPI-ACS, but an improved response for
IBIS, especially IBIS/PICsIT (Savchenko et al. 2017, A&A 603, A46).

We confirm the independent detection by SPI-ACS and IBIS/PICsIT of a
short duration (~0.012 sec) event, consistent with that reported in
Troja et al. The signal in SPI-ACS (75 keV-10 MeV) and in IBIS/PICsIT
(200 keV-1.2 MeV) has a S/N of 5.1, and 4.2, respectively.

 From the SPI-ACS observation, we estimate a 75 keV-2 MeV fluence of
GRB150101B in the time interval T_0-0.05s - T_0+0.1s of (1.3 Â±
0.3)e-7 erg/cm2, assuming a simple power-law spectrum with a slope of
1.2 (as measured by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM).

Analysis is on-going to constrain any possible soft gamma-ray
afterglow with contemporaneous INTEGRAL observations.
