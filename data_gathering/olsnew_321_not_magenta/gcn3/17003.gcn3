We again observed the field of GRB 141004A (D'Elia, et al., GCN 16878)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/10 31.31 to
2014/10 31.46 UTC (26.34 to 26.48 days after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 2.84 hours exposure in the r, i and z bands.

We continue to detect the source reported from previous epochs of RATIR
observations (Littlejohns, et al., GCN 16963; GCN 16937; GCN 16887). We
obtain the following detections and upper limit (3 sigma):

  r     23.62 +/- 0.19
  i     23.17 +/- 0.15
  z     > 21.09

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. In comparison to our previous
epochs of observations, the source appears to have brightened in the r
and i bands, consistent with an emerging supernova similar to SN 1998bw
(Schulze, et al., GCN 16936).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
