SUBJECT: HETE-2 48 hour Launch Delay

Saturday, 7 October 2000

On Friday night (6 October) at 2300 EDT, it was decided by NASA and MIT
to delay the launch of HETE-2 by 48 hours.  The delay resulted 
from the need to repair a spacecraft ground-support cable which was 
accidently damaged by Orbital Corporation personnel while removing a 
protective cover over the Pegasus fairing.  Also, it became known to 
NASA that a previously-unannounced outage of Internet service to the 
Kwajalein Missile Range would have taken place during the Friday 
countdown and during a portion of the Saturday morning launch window.

Validation of the repaired cable, a short functional test of the 
satellite, and battery recharging will occur during the delay.
The next launch attempt will occur on Monday morning (9 October),
at approximately 0145 EDT.
