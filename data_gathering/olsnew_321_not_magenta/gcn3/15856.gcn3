A. Volnova (IKI), N. Tungalag (Research Centre of Astronomy and 
Geophysics MAS), S. Schmalz (AIP), V. Voropaev (KIAM), I.Molotov (KIAM), 
A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift Swift GRB 140211A (Cummings et al., 
GCN 15816) with ORI-40 telescope of Khureltogot observatory (Mongolia) 
starting on Feb., 11 (UT) 12:29:12, i.e., ~6 minutes after the trigger. 
We took several unfiltered images of 60 s exposure. Within the enhanced 
BAT error circle (Cummings et al., GCN 15820) we do not detect any 
optical counterpart in differently stacked images.

Details of the photometry are following:

UT start-end        t-T0       Exp.   Filter  OT    UL (3 sigma)
                    (mid, days) (s)
12:29:12-12:30:12   0.00450    1*60   None    n/d    17.0
12:29:12-12:40:31   0.00819   10*60   None    n/d    18.0
12:29:12-15:18:33   0.10468  100*60   None    n/d    18.8

The photometry is based on reference stars SDSS-DR9, (R mag,
transformation by Lupton 2005):
