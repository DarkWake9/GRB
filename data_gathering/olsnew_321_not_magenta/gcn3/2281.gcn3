INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Using the final spacecraft timing and ephemeris data, we have combined
Ulysses, RHESSI, Mars Odyssey, Konus, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) data to
obtain a final IPN error ellipse for this burst (GCN 1727, 1728; Nature
423, 415, 2003) whose area is a factor of ~7 smaller than that of the
error box announced in GCN 1728.  The 3 sigma error ellipse is centered
at RA, Decl (2000)=240.195, -9.710 degrees, with major axis 20.4
arcminutes, minor axis 0.53 arcminutes, and position angle ~18
degrees.  Its area is 8.6 square arcminutes.  The VLA source (GCN 2280)
lies within both the earlier error box and within this ellipse, roughly
0.020 degrees from its center.  A map and a lightcurve have been posted
at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/021206.
