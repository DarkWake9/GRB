The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:28:45 UT on 14 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200714C (trigger 616415330.458832 / 200714437).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 210.3, Dec = -3.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 01m, -3d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32.0 degrees.
