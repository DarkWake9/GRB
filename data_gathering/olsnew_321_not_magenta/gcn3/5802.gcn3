Using the data set from T-240 to T+726 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061110A (trigger #238108)
(Falcone, et al., GCN Circ. 5795).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 336.284, -2.252 deg {22h 25m 8.1s, -2d 15' 6.0"} (J2000)
+- 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a FRED-like peak starting at ~T-15 sec,
peaking at ~T+5 sec, and extending out to ~T+80 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 41 +- 2 sec (estimated error including systematics).  The spectral lag
is 2.75 sec +0.55-0.48 sec (between the 15-25 to 50-100 keV bands).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.8 to T+38.5 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.67 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+9.74 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
