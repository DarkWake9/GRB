Klotz, A., Boer M. (OHP), Atteia, J.L., and G. Stratta (LATT) report

The field of GRB 041219 (Mereghetti, et al., GCNC 2866) was observed with
the robotic 25 cm TAROT telescope at Calern, France.
The observation started 25 seconds after the GCN notice without filter. The
field was only 28 degrees above horizon.

We co-added 12 frames of 30s from 01:45:30 to 01:54:05 UT, i.e. while the
GRB prompt emission was still active. The associated OT described by Blake &
Bloom (GCNC 2870) is not detected at the limiting magnitude of the image R >
18.5.

We analyzed the 2MASS catalog to extract the galactic extinction through the
line of sight of GRB041219. We used the method described in Klotz et al.
(A&A 2004, vol 425, p427). From Earth to a distance modulus of about 10.5,
the visual extinction is Av=1.12. The 2MASS data don't allow probing farer
distances.
