report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"At 13:02:07.91 UT on 27 July 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered on an SGR-like burst (trigger 491317331/160727543).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 148.4, Dec = -73.3, with a statistical uncertainty of 8.8 degrees.

The Fermi/GBM location is consistent with the Swift/BAT trigger=706396
location, which is believed to be from the direction of PSR 1119-6127
(GCN #19735). This would be the second burst from the same source
and the second high B-field rotation powered pulsar detected emitting
magnetar-like bursts.

The burst has a duration of T90 ~50 ms in the energy range
10-100 keV. It is well-fit by a two blackbody model with temperatures
of kT1 = 3.5 +/- 0.8 keV and kT2 = 12.0 +/- 2.0 keV.  The
corresponding flux  in the energy range 10-100 keV is (8.0 +/-
1.0)E-07 erg/s/cm^2. The peak flux integrated over 16 ms is (1.3 +/-
0.2)E-06 erg/s/cm^2.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Detailed
analysis of this burst and any untriggered will be reported elsewhere."
