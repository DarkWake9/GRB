Following the IPN Triangulation of GRB 140611A (Golenetskii et al., GCN Circ # 16384),
a reexamination of the BAT image shows a sub-threshold source at the edge of the BAT
field of view at RA, Dec 349.939, -40.111 which is:

RA (J2000)   23h 19m 45.4s 		
Dec (J2000) -40d 06' 41"

with an estimated 90% uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin.  This location is within the
IPN error box.

In BAT, this burst had two short peaks, the first 5 times brighter, each about 0.4
seconds long, separated by about 1.8 seconds.  The total T90 was about 1.9 +/- 0.2
seconds.  Because of the partial coding, a calibrated BAT spectrum is not possible,
but the burst appears to be in the short-hard category.

A Swift TOO is being performed.
