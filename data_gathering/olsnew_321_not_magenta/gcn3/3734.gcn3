Team:

At 10:08:02 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB050802
(trigger=148646).  The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The
BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 219.287, +27.806
{+14h 37m 09s, +27d 48' 23"} (J2000), with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT
light curve has a total duration of ~20 sec.  The peak
count rate was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV).

The XRT began observing at 10:12:51 UT, 289 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT was unable to centroid on any source,
however the downlinked lightcurve and raw spectrum show a
bright variable source is present in the XRT field of view.
There are no catalogued X-ray sources in the field,
suggesting that this bright source is the GRB afterglow.

Swift-UVOT began observations after the slew, however, the
UVOT dark burst image did not come down via TDRSS so no
information is available at this time.  Detailed analysis
will be performed when data is available after the next
Malindi pass.
