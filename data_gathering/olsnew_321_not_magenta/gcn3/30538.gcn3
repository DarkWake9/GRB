"We observed GRB 210702A (Lien et al. GCN 30351) with the MeerKAT radio
telescope array over two epochs beginning on 2021 July 11 12:16 UTC (8.7 d
after the burst) and 2021 July 23 18:16 UTC (21.0 d after the burst),
respectively. Preliminary analysis reveals a brightening radio counterpart
with 1.284 GHz flux density of 123 +/- 12 uJy at 21.0 d at position:

RA (J2000) = 11:14:18.76
Dec (J2000) = -36:44:49.5

with uncertainty ~ 0.4" in each coordinate, consistent with the X-ray
position (D'Elia et al., GCN 30358), optical position (Lien et al., GCN
30351; Kuin et al., GCN 30356), and mm-band position (Laskar & Perley, GCN
30423). Further observations are planned.

The MeerKAT telescope is operated by the South African Radio Astronomy
Observatory, which is a facility of the National Research Foundation, an
agency of the Department of Science and Innovation."
