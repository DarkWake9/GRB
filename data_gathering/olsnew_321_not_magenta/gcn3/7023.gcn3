We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 071031 (Stroh et al., GCN 7020; 
Kruehler et al., GCN 7021; Haislip et al., GCN 7022) with the ESO VLT. 
Observations were triggered automatically in rapid response mode 
starting on 2007 Oct 31 at 01:16 UT (9.3 min after the trigger). We 
secured high- and low-resolution spectroscopy with UVES and FORS2, 
respectively.

 From the detection of a DLA and several metallic lines, including 
fine-structure transitions, we determine the redshift to be z=2.692, 
consistently in the UVES and FORS2 spectra. Further analysis is ongoing.

We acknowledge excellent support from the observing staff at Paranal, in 
particular Stan Stefl and Rachel Gilmour.
