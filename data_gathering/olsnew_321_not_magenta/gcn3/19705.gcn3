Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160714A (trigger #704310)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 19697).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 234.490, 63.809 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 37m 57.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +63d 48' 32.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 35%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peak structure starting at
T0, peaking at T+0.05 sec and T+0.2 sec and ending at T+0.3 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.35 +- 0.11 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.02 to T+0.40 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.38 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.9 +- 1.6 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
