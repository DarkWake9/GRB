The long GRB 090929B (Swift-BAT trigger #371050: Pagani et al., GCN 
9963) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=36565.377 s UT (10:09:25.377).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a total
duration of ~20 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.16 +/- 0.12)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+16.208 s
of (3.80 +/- 0.90)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+16.640 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV
range) by GRB (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.41 (-0.77, +1.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -1.82(-0.59, +0.24),
the peak energy Ep = 282(-78, +169) keV (chi2 = 52.4/59 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
