V. Sokolov (SAO RAS) reports:

  A similar phenomenon of the OT reddening in a later phase of light curve,
that was predicted in GCN#2081 (A. Zeh, S. Klose, J. Greiner) for OT GRB 030329
in 20-30 days after GRB, was already observed for OT GRB 970508
(Sokolov, Zharikov, Baryshev et al. 1999, A&A, 344, 43;
Sokolov, astro-ph/0102492).
Though then the object was much weaker than now (for the OT GRB 030329).
But the peak magnitudes of Type Ib/c (or core collapse) SNe are not
constant: M_B is from -16 to -20.5 (Richardson et al. 2002, AJ, 123, 745).
The duration of maximum (or "red shoulder") in the light curve can be
both similar to one of SN 1998bw, and longer, such as for
the peculiar Type Ic SN 1997ef with lower luminosity
(Iwamoto, Nakamura, Nomoto, Mazzali et al. 2000, astro-ph/9807060).
So, it is crucially important to continue observing the light curve
of this unique bright object OT GRB 030329  FURTHER in ALL  possible (UBVRcIc)
photometric bands not to miss the predicted (strong or weak) effect
of the OT reddening in 20-30 days.
