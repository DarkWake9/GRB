of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR telescope system responded to Swift trigger
353567 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9438) under fair observing conditions.
Our narrow-field instruments began observing the location at
03:18:37.96 UTC, 19.6 s after the Swift trigger.  We detect the
optical counterpart initially reported by Cannizzo et al. (GCN 9438)
and Flewelling et al. (GCN 9439).  Our first image at T+22.1 seconds
shows the counterpart at R~17.1.  It appears to brighten over the
next minute reaching a peak near R~16.3 and then begins fading in
the manner described by Schady et al. (GCN 9450) and Rossi et al.
(GCN 9458).  Our unfiltered images were calibrated against the
USNO-B1 R-band.  The following table gives selected observations,
not corrected for extinction, from this event.
