MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in South Africa (South African Astronomical 
Observatory) was pointed to the IceCube-191122A (GCN 26276) errorbox
23 sec after notice and  55 sec after  trigger time at 2019-11-22 22:46:06 
UT, with upper limit up to  19.9 mag.  The observations began at zenith 
distance = 46 deg. The sun  altitude  is  -37.6 deg.

MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, SAI 
Crimea astronomical station) was pointed to the IceCube-191122A 
errorbox 28 sec after notice and  60 sec after trigger time at 2019-11-22 
22:46:10 UT, with upper limit up to  15.8 mag. The observations began at 
zenith distance = 62 deg. The sun  altitude  is -61.3 deg.

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was 
pointed to the IceCube-191122A errorbox 54 sec after notice and  87 sec 
after trigger time at 2019-11-22 22:46:38 UT, with upper limit up to  19.9 mag. The 
observations began at zenith distance = 28 deg. The sun  altitude  is  -61.1 deg.

The galactic latitude b = -59 deg., longitude l = 155 deg.
