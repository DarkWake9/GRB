The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:34:46 UT on 16 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210516A (trigger 642900891.497152 / 210516982).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 22.1, Dec = 74.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 28m, 74d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 116.0 degrees.
