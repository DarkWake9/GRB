At the G296853 event time, GBM was taking data and viewing the entire
un-occulted sky approximately 67 degrees from Earth center (RA = 66.9, DEC
= +23.4), which includes 49% of the LIGO Bayestar probability map.

There was a single GBM on-board trigger within 1 hour after the event time.
However, this trigger was likely due to a terrestrial gamma-ray flash and
unrelated to the G296853 event. The untargeted ground-based search of GBM
data for short-duration GRBs (Briggs et al., in prep) found a
low-reliability short GRB candidate ~76 minutes after the G296853 event
time, although the localization of this candidate is entirely inconsistent
with the Bayestar map.

The targeted search of the GBM data ([1], [2]) also did not find a
significant gamma-ray signal. This search processes time scales of 0.256 to
8.192 s within 30 s of the LIGO event. No interesting gamma-ray candidate
was found within this time window.

Further analysis and upper limits will be reported later.
