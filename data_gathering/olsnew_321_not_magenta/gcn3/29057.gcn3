The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:00:31 UT on 16 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201216A (trigger 629838036.239118 / 201216792).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 190.6, Dec = 40.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 42m, 40d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 39.0 degrees.
