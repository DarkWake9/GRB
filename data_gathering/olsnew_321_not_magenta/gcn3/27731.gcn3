P. Veres (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:


Swift-BAT detected GRB 200512A at 20:33:15 UT (GCN 27726). There was no
Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event.

An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard
triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM identified no counterparts.


The GBM targeted search [1], the most sensitive, coherent search for
GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around BAT trigger time. A transient
source was identified whose most significant timescale according to the
search is 8.192 s, with a log likelihood ratio of 23. It has consistent
location, and it is consistent with a "normal" spectrum (Band function with
Epeak = 230 keV, alpha = -1.0, beta = -2.3) for a GRB.
