and the CALET collaboration:

The long GRB 180722B (Fermi-GBM trigger #553996158; Konus-Wind
trigger time on 23:49:18.90 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:49:16.174 UTC on 22 July 2018.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows two broad pulses which start
at T-4.0 sec and end at T+39.9 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
40.1 +- 3.2 sec and 30.0 +- 1.7 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
