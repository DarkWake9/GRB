K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline,
on behalf of the Konus Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets
and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed this burst at 73676 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~6 s, a 25 - 100
keV fluence of ~~3x10^-7 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over
0.25 s of ~~3.8x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated
it to a preliminary, 400 sq. arcmin., 3 sigma error box 
whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  0 h 13 m 33.86 s    -77 o 58 '  25.33 "  (CENTER)
  0 h 13 m 49.03 s    -77 o 52 '   9.79 "  (CORNER)
  0 h 23 m 52.59 s    -77 o 35 '  22.87 "  (CORNER)
  0 h  2 m 31.18 s    -78 o 20 '  22.65 "  (CORNER)
  0 h 13 m 18.48 s    -78 o  4 '  40.90 "  (CORNER)

Only relatively minor improvements to this error box
are expected due to the weakness of the burst.
