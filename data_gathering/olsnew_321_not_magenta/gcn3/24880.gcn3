S. B. Cenko (GSFC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), and A. Melandri (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift team:

Using the full data set from recent downlinks, we report further ground
data
analysis for Swift trigger 911102 (Cenko et al. GCN Circ. 24876).

The BAT analysis uses data from T-239 to T+963 sec. The BAT image
significance has now decreased to 5.0 sigma (15-350 keV). Also, the
mask-weighted light curve does not show anything significant.

The XRT began observing the fields at T+52 minutes due to an observing
constraint. No source was detected in 1.85 ks of promptly downlinked data
within the BAT error circle.

We thus conclude that this trigger was likely a noise fluctuation.
