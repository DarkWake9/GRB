A. C. Updike, D. H. Hartmann, G. L. Bryngelson, R. C. Goldthwaite, and J.
R. Puls (Clemson University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up
Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 070125 (GCN 6024, Hurley et al.) beginning at
01:49:58 UT with the SARA 0.9m at Kitt Peak under decent weather
conditions.  We have obtained 20 180-second exposures in the R band.  In
stacked images, we can clearly see the afterglow candidate identified by
Cenko & Fox (GCN 6028).  Observations are continuing.
