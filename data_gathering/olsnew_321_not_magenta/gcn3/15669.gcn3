Bin-Bin Zhang and Narayana Bhat (UAH/CSPAR) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:17:37.81 UT on January 02 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 140102A (trigger 410390260/
140102887). This GRB also triggered Swift (Hagen et al. GCN 15653) and 
Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al, GCN 15667) and was detected by Fermi/LAT 
(Sonbas et al. GCN 15659) and in several ground follow-up observations 
(Xu et al GCN 15655; Gorosabel et al, GCN 15658; Kimura et al, GCN 15663 
and Tanga et al, 15665). The GBM on-ground calculated location is consistent 
with the Swift/XRT position and those obtained with follow-up observations.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was 
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. The 
initial angle from the LAT boresight was 47 deg from the Fermi/GBM 
position.

The GBM light curve consists of two major bright overlapping peaks. The 
duration (T90) of the burst was about 3.6 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged 
spectrum from T0+0.4 s to T0+4 s is best fit with  a Band function with 
Epeak = 186 +/- 5 keV, alpha = -0.71 +/- 0.02  and beta = -2.49 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.78 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+1.98 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 49.7 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
