D. A. Kann (Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg), and S. Manohar (USC/ 
Los Angeles), report: 

We observed the field of GRB 060515 (Cummings et al., GCN 5132) with the 
Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope under good observing conditions. Seeing 
and transparency were very good, but sky background was high due to the 
moderate distance from the Sun. We obtained 16 x 600 sec images in the Rc 
filter for a total integration time of 160 minutes. The mean observation 
time was July 2.4928 UT (8 x 600 sec images in one night each), which is 
48.39 days after the burst. We determine the zero point of the image in 
comparison with nine unsaturated and isolated stars of the USNOB1.0 
catalog. Astrometry is also performed against the USNOB1.0 catalog. 

At the refined position of the X-ray afterglow (Page et al., GCN 5139), we 
do not detect any sources. The 2 sigma limiting magnitude of the image is 
Rc=23.6. This magnitude is not corrected for the small foreground 
extinction, E(B-V)=0.027. 

We detect three sources closeby (positions with errors of 0."5, photometry 
errors statistical only):

RA=08:29:10.92, Dec=+73:34:07.70	Rc = 20.19 +\- 0.02 (also in the 
USNOB1.0 catalog)

RA=08:29:08.01, Dec=+73:34:09.01	Rc = 22.29 +\- 0.11

RA=08:29:08.29, Dec=+73:33:56.67	Rc = 21.64 +\- 0.06

All three objects are stellar at our plate scale (1."23/pixel).
