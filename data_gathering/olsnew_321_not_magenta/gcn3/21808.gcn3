At 13:45:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located MAXI J1535-571 (trigger=770656).  Swift did not slew due to it being a
known source with a merit value lower than the merit value of the current planned
observing target.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 233.825, -57.246, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 35m 18s
   Dec(J2000) = -57d 14' 45"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time 
light curve does not show anything significant.
