Swift UVOT team.

CORRECTION: The time at which the UVOT began observations of GRB050219b 
should read as 21:57:51 in GCN 3046 and GCN 3050. This was 52 minutes 
after the initial Swift BAT trigger (Cummings et al, GCN 3044), the delay 
being caused by the Earth-limb constraint.

No new source was detected at the corrected XRT position (Racusin et al, 
GCN 3049), and the 3-sigma limiting magnitudes given in GCN 3050 still 
apply:

Filter	Lim_Mag  Tot_Exposure(s)   T_start (s)
  UVW2	~ 22.16		1154	     T+3120
  UVM2	~ 22.24		1435	     T+3243
  UVW1	~ 22.23   	940	     T+3349
  U	~ 20.74   	100	     T+3455
  B	~ 20.9    	100	     T+3561
  V	~ 19.41   	100	     T+3136

We caution that the instrument is not yet fully calibrated and that the
magnitude limits presented here may need to be refined.
