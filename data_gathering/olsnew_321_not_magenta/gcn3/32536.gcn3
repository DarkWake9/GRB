On behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

As part of the ZTF neutrino follow up program (Stein et al. 2022), we observed the localization region of the neutrino event IceCube-220907A (Lincetto et al., GCN 32523) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope, equipped with the 47 square degree ZTF camera (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019). We started observations in the g- and r-band beginning at 2022-09-08 03:58 UTC, approximately 21.2 hours after event time. We covered 75% (5.4 sq deg) of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. Each exposure was 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag.

The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2021) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We are left with the following high-significance transient candidate by our pipeline, lying within the 90.0% localization of the skymap:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ZTF Name     | IAU Name  | RA (deg)    | DEC (deg)   | Filter | Mag   | MagErr |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ZTF22aatwsqt | AT2022oyn | 224.4694373 | +44.8892302 | r      | 20.83 | 0.19   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

ZTF22aatwsqt/AT2022oyn is a potential supernova 40 days post peak. Spectroscopic follow-up is encouraged to determine the type.
