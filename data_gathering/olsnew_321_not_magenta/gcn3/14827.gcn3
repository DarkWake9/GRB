At 23:14:21 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130608A (trigger=557771).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 24.580, +41.494 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 38m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 29' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve suggests a broad weak peak
from T-20 to T+40 s.  The maximum count rate was ~500 counts/sec 
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:17:02.9 UT, 161.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 24.6087,
41.5027 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 01h 38m 26.08s
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 30' 09.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 83 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (6.62 x
10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 6.2
(+5.87/-4.48) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.77e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 168 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.06.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
