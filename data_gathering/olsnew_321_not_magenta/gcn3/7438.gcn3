California at Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

We have analyzed the KAIT data on GRB 080319B (GCN 7472, 7428) as reported
in GCN 7430. Preliminary reduction of the unfiltered data, calibrated to
SDSS observations of the field, shows a smooth light curve from t = 20 to
120 minutes after the BAT trigger, with an apparent change in power-law
decay index at t ~ 35 minutes. The power-law decay index is measured to be
-1.89 +/- 0.04 between t = 20.1 to 26.3 minutes after the BAT trigger, and
-1.23 +/- 0.02 between t=60.9 to 117.2 minutes after the BAT trigger.
The shallower decay is also observed at t ~ 80 minutes as noted in GCN 7435.
We note this change in power-law decay index is reminiscent of what has
been observed in GRB 990123 (e.g. Akerlof et al. 1999, Nature 398, 400) and
GRB 021211 (e.g. Li et al. 2003, ApJ 586, L9), and suggests a transition from
reverse shock to forward shock emission.

Selected KAIT unfiltered photometry, all unfiltered data calibrated to
the R band via the SDSS calibration:
