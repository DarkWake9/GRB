We observed the field of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al.; GCN 14204) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/02 15.13 to 2013/02 15.18 UTC (1.58 to
2.88 hours after the BAT trigger) through intermittent clouds, obtaining a
total of 25 minutes of useful exposure in the r' and i' bands and 19
minutes of useful exposure in the Z and J bands.

We detect the optical counterpart discovered by ROTSE (Zheng et al.; GCN
14205).   In comparison with USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we derive the following
magnitudes in the AB system:

  r' = 17.86 +/- 0.05
  i' = 17.10 +/- 0.04
  Z = 16.86 +/-0.04
  J = 16.67 +/- 0.04

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.  Compared to the earlier observation at Palomar (Cenko et al;
GCN 14209), our r band magnitude implies a temporal fade by >1 mag on a
timescale of 2 hours, with a corresponding power law fade f ~ t^(-1.5)
between 1 and 3 hours after the GRB.

Mártir.
