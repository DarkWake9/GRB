The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170607A (D'Ai et al., GCN 21214) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jun 08.12, Jun 10.29, Jun 
12.28 and Jun 16.24 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 21215), with 3sigma upper limits of 318 
uJy, 108 uJy, 117 uJy and 117 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
