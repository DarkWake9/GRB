M. Andreev, A. Sergeev, (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy), Ju. 
Babina (CrAO) A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up 
collaboration report:

We observed   the field of GRB 081203B detected by SWIFT in a slew mode 
(Copeteet al, GCN 8600) with the Z-600  telescope of Mt. Terskol 
observatory.  A set of  R-band exposures was taken starting  Dec. 04 (UT) 
01:44. In a combined image of 10x90 s taken at mid time Dec. 04 (UT) 
01:53:45 we detect afterglow (Schady et al, GCN 8606) in coordinate 
(J2000) 15 15 11.66  +44 25 42.7. A preliminary photometry of the 
afterglow at Dec. 04 (UT) 01:53:45 is R=19.8. The photometry is based on 
USNO-A2.0 field stars.
