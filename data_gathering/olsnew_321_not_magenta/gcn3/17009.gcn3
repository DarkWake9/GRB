SUBJECT: GRB 141031B: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    14/10/31 21:02:11 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 712 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT
images for GRB 141031B, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 356.90499, +41.35253 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 23h 47m 37.20s
Dec (J2000): +41d 21' 09.1"

with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
