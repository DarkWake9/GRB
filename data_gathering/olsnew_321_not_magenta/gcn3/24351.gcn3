collaboration:

We observed the field of GRAWITA_J215716.26+832239.4 reported by L. Izzo
et.al. (GCN 24340) at 2019-04-29T21:04:39.694 UT with the 0.7m GROWTH-India
telescope. The image was taken in r filter with 600 sec exposure. We did
not find any source at the specified position up to mag_lim ~ 19.8,
calibrated with PS1 photometry.

We also continued follow-up of the localisation region of the GW candidate
event S190426c (LVC et al. GCN 24168, G. Waratkar et. al. GCN 24316) with
the GROWTH-India telescope in the northernmost part of the sky. We obtained
43 r-band overlapping images covering a total area of 12.1 square degrees,
with 8.9% probability of containing the GW counterpart on 20190428 and 16
r-band overlapping images covering a total area of 4.4 square degrees, with
4.1% probability of on 20190829. Exposures were 600 seconds long and
reached a typical depth of 20.5 magnitude. Data processing is underway. On
20190428 (20190429), these fields contain 313(104) galaxies from the GLADE
catalog and 10(4) galaxies from NED. No obvious transients were seen in the
NED galaxies.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
