We observed the afterglow of GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN 23688) with 
the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) located at the Indian 
Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, India. The observations started on 
2019-01-15 (14:51:32 UT) and two Bessell R-band images were obtained in 
a gap of about 1.3 hr. The exposure time was 200 sec for each frame. The 
OT candidate (Lipunov et al., GCN 23693; Selsing et al., GCN 23695; 
Bolmer et GCN 23702; D'Avanzo et al., GCN 23729; Kim et al., GCN 23732, 
23734; Kumar et al., GCN 23733) is clearly detected in our frames with 
the following magnitudes:

UT-mid                   JD               Mag
-------------------    ----------    --------------
2019-01-15 14:53:13    2458499.12    19.70 +/- 0.10
2019-01-15 16:13:33    2458499.18    19.81 +/- 0.09

These magnitudes were calibrated using the magnitudes of field stars 
from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue.

We thank the observing staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the 
observations.
