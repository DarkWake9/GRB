and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S200115j T0 = 2020-01-15 04:23:09.742 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 26759), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-5 min to T0+11 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high 
energy trigger mode at the trigger time of S200115j. Using
the CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in the
10-100 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger 
time and found no candidates in the overwrap region with the
LIGO-Virgo high probability localization region.  The 90% 
upper limit of CAL is 1.7 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) 
when the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 20%. The CAL 
FOV was centered at RA = 84.4 deg, DEC = +45.9 deg at T0.
