D.K. Sahu, G.C. Anupama (IIA, Bangalore), Kuntal Misra (ARIES) report.

The field of GRB 080506 (Baumgartner et al., GCN 7685) was observed using
HFOSC mounted on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope, Indian Astronomical
Observatory, India. A series of 300sec exposures were taken in R-band
between  20:45 UT and 23:00 UT on 06/05/2008. The optical counter part is
detected in all our frames. Using the calibration by Kawabata et al.  (GCN
7686), the estimated R band magnitude of the optical counter part   is
20.13+/-0.1 mag at 20:47UT. The optical counter part faded by ~ 0.6 
magnitude during our  observations.
