Gaurav Waratkar(IITB), Harsh Kumar (IITB), Viraj Karambelkar (IITB), Tsewang Stanzin (IAO, IIA), Varun Bhalerao (IITB), G.C. Anupama (IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:

Further analysis of GROWTH-India data reveals that the reported object is actually not a counterpart, but asteroid 2010 FQ3. A fainter object seen in subsequent images was a background star. We hereby retract GCN 24051.
