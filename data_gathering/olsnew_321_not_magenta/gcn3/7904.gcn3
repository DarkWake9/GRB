report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB080625, detected
by SuperAGILE (Pacciani et al. GCN 7903), from
the 1.5m OSN telescope starting at June 25.8591
(8.14 hours after the burst). Preliminary analysis
does not show any evident new source within the
3' error box as compared with the DSS2 IR frame.
We note, however, that our combined 4x300s I-band
frame yields a limit of I < 21.5, significantly
deeper than the catalogue.

Further imaging is scheduled in order to determine
if any of the objects that we detect at or beyond the
limit of the catalogue is the afterglow of GRB 080625.
