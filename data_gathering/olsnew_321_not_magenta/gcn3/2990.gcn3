Derek B. Fox reports on behalf of a larger collaboration: 

"We have imaged the in-flight error circle of HETE Alert #3667 in a
series of 60-second R-band pointings beginning at 04:41 UT.  Visual
comparison of these individual images to the Guide Star Catalog (v2.2)
reveals no new sources to the R~18 mag limit of that catalog."
