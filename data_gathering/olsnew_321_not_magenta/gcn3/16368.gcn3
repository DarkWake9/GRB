M. M. Chester (PSU) and V. Mangano (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of the Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 140606B beginning 184.4 ks after the Fermi/GBM trigger (Burns et al. GCN Circ. 16363).  No source consistent with iPTF14bfu, the optical counterpart proposed by Singer et al. (GCN Circ. 16360) and Perley et al. (GCN Circ. 16365), is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.  Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) are given in the following table:

Filter   T_start(s)   T_stop(s)   Exp(s)   Mag
u        185271       191914      1693     >21.1
b        186146       192611      1495     >20.9
v        184395       191055      1693     >20.6

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.12 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
