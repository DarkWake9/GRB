GRB 160525C (Konus-Wind trigger time on 10:54:28.0 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 10:54:20.25 on 25 May 2016.  The burst signal was seen by all 
CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a double peak structure starting at T0+4 sec, peaking 
at T0+5 sec, and ending at T0+6.5 sec sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data 
is 2.4 +- 0.3 sec (40-230 keV).  The light curve is available at

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center
located at the Waseda University.
