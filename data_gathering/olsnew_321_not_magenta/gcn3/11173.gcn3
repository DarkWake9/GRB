Veli-Pekka Hentunen, Markku Nissinen and Tuomo Salmi (Taurus Hill
Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

Taurus Hill Observatory (A95, Varkaus, Finland) C-14 telescope and SBIG
ST-8XME CCD camera were used to detect GRB 100901A optical afterglow.
The observations were started at 2010-09-01 21:08:30 (UT) and stopped at
2010-09-02 01:11:13 (UT). A number of unfiltered and BVR observations with
varying exposure times were made. The afterglow was detected at following
position RA 1 49 03.45 and DEC +22 45 30.5 consistent those given by Immler
s. et al. (GCN 11159) and Guidorzi C. et al. (GCN 11160) to within positional 
errors. 

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using USNO-B1.0
1127-0027231 (R = 15.37 and B = 16.38)) as the comparison:
