The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:50:17 UT on 3 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210903A (trigger 652326622.389106 / 210903077).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 178.6, Dec = 39.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 54m, 39d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102.0 degrees.
