report:

"BeppoSAX performed two NFI observations of the candidate GRB 020410.
Start times were Apr. 11, 06:53 UT (20.2 hrs after the burst) and
Apr. 12 16:49 UT (54.3 hrs after the burst). We detect a single
unknown slowly fading source in both observations whose refined
coordinates (J2000) are:

 RA: 22 06 25.8, Dec: -83 49 27

This is 1.3 arcmin from the WFC derived position (GCN 1349) and 15 arcsec
from the quick-look analysis derived one (GCN 1366).
The error circle radius is 20 arcsec (90% confidence).
This is the smallest ever reported for a BSAX-NFI detected GRB.
For more information about NFI source coordinates accuracy see the
BeppoSAX-ASDC report at the URL:

Images of the two observations and the decay behavior are posted at the URL:

We note that no gamma-ray detection was reported so far (the BSAX-GRBM
was not operative). This fact, the X-ray properties of the WFC (2-28 keV)
prompt event and the spectral/temporal behavior of the afterglow
strongly support the hypothesis of a XRF or anomalous GRB.

(Sub-)arcsec position accuracies obtainable with Chandra or XMM-Newton
would greatly facilitate deeper studies at other wavelengths."
