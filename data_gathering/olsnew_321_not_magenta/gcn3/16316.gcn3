Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140521A (trigger #599546)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 16311).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 320.177, 67.587 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 20m 42.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +67d 35' 12.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 55%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-2 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+11 sec with a tail out to ~T+50 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.88 +- 1.09 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.15 to T+11.44 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.42 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.5 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
