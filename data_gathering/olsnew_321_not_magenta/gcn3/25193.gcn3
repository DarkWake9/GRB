report on behalf of the AGILE Team:


In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190728q at T0 = 2019-07-28 06:45:10
(UT), a preliminary

analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found no event
 candidates within a time

interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.


At the T0, about 100% of the S190728q 90 c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within

the accessible S190728q localization region, from a minimum of 1.63E-06 erg
cm^-2 to a maximum of

2.59E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with
photon index 1.5).


The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV.

Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
