During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long
burst, GRB 210719A, at 2021-07-19T02:24:59.500 UTC (denoted as T0).

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 15-3500 keV, 
this burst mainly consists of multiple pulses with a duration about 400 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000):
Ra: 82.64 deg
Dec: 51.02 deg
Err: 5.16 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration. 

The location map could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
