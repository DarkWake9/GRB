The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:35:49.07 UT on 20 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201120A (trigger 627561354 / 201120442).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 78.2, Dec = -57.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 5h 13m, -57d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 26.0 degrees.
