D. A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Further VLA observations were made of the short-duration burst
GRB000326 (GCN #618) at 4.86 GHz, starting on March 28.82 UT.  None of
the radio sources reported in GCN #619 show any evidence for
variability between the two epochs above a 2-sigma level. We note that
all radio afterglows detected to date show some level of short-term
variability."
