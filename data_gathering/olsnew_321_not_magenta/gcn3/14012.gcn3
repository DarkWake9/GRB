"At 05:05:50.96 UT on 28 Nov 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 121128A (trigger 375771953/121128212)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT and UVOT
(Oates et al. 2012, GCN 14007).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift UVOT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two bright pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 17s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5.1 s to T0+27.6 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 62.2 +/- 4.6 keV,
alpha = -0.80 +/- 0.12, and beta = -2.41 +/- 0.10.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.04 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 17.9 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
