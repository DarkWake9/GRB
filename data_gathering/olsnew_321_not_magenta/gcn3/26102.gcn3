The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:36:35 UT on 31 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191031A (trigger 594175000.608294 / 191031025).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 247.3, Dec = 22.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 29m, 22d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 93.0 degrees.
