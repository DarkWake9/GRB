SUBJECT: A mistake in testing a new function in Swift

S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC)  on behalf of the Swift team:

At 17:28:08 UT (28 Oct 09) an XRT_Position Notice was distributed
(TrigNum 20117).  This notice was a result of a test that the
Swift team was conducting to test a new function within the spacecraft.
I had the swift_blocked2world filter enabled in GCN, and as such
the notice should have been blocked.  The other notices were blocked,
but this one leaked through.  I apologise for the confusion.
