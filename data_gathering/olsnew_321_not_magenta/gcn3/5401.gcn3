S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 050805 (Ziaeepour et al.; GCN 5398) with
the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  We obtained 2 x 60 s images in
Kron R and Sloan i' and z' beginning approximately 3 minutes after
the burst, before closing due to high humidity.  We find no sources inside
the XRT error circle to a limiting magnitude of R > 19.0 (calculated with
respect to the USNO-B catalog).
