A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), A. Gomboc (U. Ljubljana), I. A. Steele and C. G. Mundell (LJMU), on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically followed up Swift GRB 140318A (Cenko et al., GCN 15986) at 00:27:37 UT (~18.5 min after the burst trigger).

We clearly detect the optical afterglow at the position reported by Schulze et al. (GCN 15987). In a coadded 6x10s SDSS-r image, we estimate the magnitude r' = 19.84 +- 0.11 at t_mid = 50.6 min since the Swift/BAT trigger time. The magnitude is calibrated against nearby SDSS stars.
