A. Corsi (TTU) and M.M. Kasliwal (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We analyzed a further Karl G. Jansky VLA observation of the field of SSS17a, the possible 
counterpart of G298048 in NGC 4993 identified by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN  21529). The 
observation started on 2017-Aug-19 22:01:48 UT, ended on 2017-Aug-20 00:01:24 UT, and 
was conducted with the VLA in its C configuration in C-X-Ku-bands. At a central frequency 
of ~9.7 GHz, our preliminary analysis does not show any significant emission at the location 
of the optical candidate SSS17a down to a 3-sigma limit of about 18 uJy. We detect the host 
at a flux level consistent with what measured by Alexander et al. (LVC GCN 21545). Analysis of 
the data collected in other bands is on-going.
