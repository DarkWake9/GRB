A. N. Morgan, D. A. Perley, C. R. Klein, and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

We continued to observe the location of GRB 100513A (Baumgartner et al.,
GCN 10746) with the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona.
The candidate afterglow (Morgan et al., GCN 10747) is detected in all
three filters (J, H, and Ks) in the first epoch.  The source fades
between epochs, confirming that this is indeed the afterglow of GRB
100513A.

The preliminary photometry yields:

post burst
t_mid (hr) exp.(s) filt  mag   m_err
0.99       1030    J     17.8  0.1
0.99       1030    H     17.2  0.1
0.99       1030    Ks    16.4  0.2

1.68       1685    J     18.0  0.1
1.68       1685    H     17.6  0.1

2.72       2855    J     18.4  0.2

All magnitudes are given in the Vega system, calibrated to 2MASS. No
correction for Galactic extinction has been made to the above reported
values.
