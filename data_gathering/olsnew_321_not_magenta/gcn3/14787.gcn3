Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130605A (trigger #557508)
(Holland, et al., GCN Circ. 14773).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 134.536, -33.477 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 58m 08.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -33d 28' 36.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 5%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-5 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+45 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 12.6 +- 3.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.48 to T+9.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.58 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.6 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.1 +- 0.9 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
