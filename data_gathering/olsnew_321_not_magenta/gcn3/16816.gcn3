SUBJECT: GRB 140909A: Confirmation of the Swift-XRT afterglow

C. Pagani (U. Leicester) and E. Sonbas (Adiyaman U.) report on behalf of 
the Swift team:

A second epoch of XRT data was collected on the field of the Swift/BAT 
ground detected GRB 140909A (Palmer, GCN Circ. 16808), from 148 ks to 
252 ks after the  Swift/BAT trigger.

The X-ray source reported in GCN Circ. 16811, Pagani et al., at a mean 
count rate of 6.9e-03 ct/sec, is now no longer detected, having faded 
below a 3-sigma upper limit of 2.3 x 10^-3 count s^-1 (0.3-10 keV). We 
therefore confirm that this is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 140909A

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
