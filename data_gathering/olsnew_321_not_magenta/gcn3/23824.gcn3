report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-01-29T12:15:31.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190129B (trigger ID: HEB190129510) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by IPN  (Hurley et al., GCN 23808) 
and Konus-Wind (Frederiks et al., GCN 23809)

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 10.1 s measured from T0+8.10 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+14.07 s, is 18437.6 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 126004.0 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
