V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA), S. B. Cenko (GSFC) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 1.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 140209A (Cenko  et al. GCN
Circ. 15808),  from 188.1 ks to 195.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. Using 1439 s of PC mode
data and 1 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue): RA, Dec = 81.32915, +32.49892 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 05h 25m 19.00s
Dec(J2000): +32d 29' 56.1"

with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading. The
position is consistent with that of the optical afterglow reported by
Perley (GCN Circ. 15809).
