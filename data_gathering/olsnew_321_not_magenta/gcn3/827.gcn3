GRB000926 - Optical observations

The optical counterpart of GRB000926 has been observed using the
CFH12K CCD mosaic camera at the prime focus of the 3.6-m CFH
Telescope for the fourth night.

One 600s exposure has been obtained with a decent seeing
(0.7"). Using the new R magnitude of 17.06 by Halpern et al.
(GCN #824) for the reference star, the R magnitude of
the GRB is found as:

Oct. 02.2626  R = 22.82 +/- 0.08

The last two days of data from Halpern et al. (GCN #284),
Fynbo et al. (GCN #825), and the previous CFHT measurement
(GCN #826) suggest a new decay phase with a decay rate
of 1.47 +/- 0.10 .

A new graph of the light curve in R can be found at

D. Kocevski, D. Donovan and G. Luppino are acknowledged for their
help in this observation.
