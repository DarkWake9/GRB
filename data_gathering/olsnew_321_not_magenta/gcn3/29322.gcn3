The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 02:54:09 UT on 19 Jan 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210119A (trigger 632717654.819782 / 210119121).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 285.8, Dec = -63.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 03m, -63d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 7.0 degrees.
