At 21:58:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061110B (trigger=238174).  The BAT on-board calculated
location is  RA,Dec 323.901, +6.877 {21h 35m 36s, +06d 52' 37"}
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment,
including  systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve shows several
peaks starting at ~T-18 sec and ending at ~T+30 sec with a duration of
about 45 sec. The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~8 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze. The XRT and UVOT will begin observing this field at 22:52 UT.
