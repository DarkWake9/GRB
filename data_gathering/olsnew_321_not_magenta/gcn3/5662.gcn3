We have received additional data beyond that used for GCN Circ 5660
(Fenimore, et al) now out to T+1000 sec.  We note that there is
highly significant emmission in the mask-weighted light curve starting
at T+400 sec and ending at T+600 sec.  This emission is much softer
than the initial emission at T_zero.

Given the spectral signiture of the initial T_zero emission and
that there are no known sources at this location (Galactic or extra-Galactic),
we still strongly believe that this event is a GRB and not some other
non-GRB astrophysical source.  We therefore conclude that this late-time
emission is a flare.
