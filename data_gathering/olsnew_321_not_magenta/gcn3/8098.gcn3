report:

We observed the GRB 080810 afterglow with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope
(RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey).

The serie of 600 sec (Ic), 600 sec (Rc), 900 sec (V) exposures was made
by using TFOSC  instrument under moderate seeing, starting at 12 Aug 2008,
01:19 UT, i.e. 36.16 hours after the burst.

The OT is clearly detected on all images. Using USNO-B1.0 stars
we estimate an Rc magnitude of 20.66+/-0.03 (~36.4 hours after the burst).
Using our earlier observations (Burenin et al., GCN8088)
the calculated power law index is -0.91+/-0.09 for decay
from ~8.3 h to ~36.4 h.
