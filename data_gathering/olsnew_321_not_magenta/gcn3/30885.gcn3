The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 00:43:57 UT on 27 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210927A (trigger 654396242.858592 / 210927031).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 252.1, Dec = 0.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 48m, 0d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 20.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 28.0 degrees.
