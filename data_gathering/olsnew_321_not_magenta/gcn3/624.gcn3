TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  624
SUBJECT: GRB000301C - Addendum to GCN 623
DATE:    00/04/05 01:58:59 GMT
FROM:    Christian Veillet at CFHT  <veillet@cfht.hawaii.edu>

A composite image of the GRB field without anything at the
location of the OT is posted at
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~veillet/grb.html

An obvious consequence of the magnitude limit given in GCN623
is that the host galaxy is fainter than R=26 ...

I should have included that in the previous GCN. Sorry!
