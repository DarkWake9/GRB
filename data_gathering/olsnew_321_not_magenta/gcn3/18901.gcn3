We observed the field of GRB 160119A (Marshall, et al., GCN 18893) with the 
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m 
Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San 
Pedro Mártir from 2016/01 19.36 to 2016/01 19.54 UTC (5.61 to 9.76 hours after 
the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.20 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands. 

We identified the source reported by Malesani et al., GCN 18895. 
In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the 
following detections and upper limits (3-sigma): 

 r   23.78 +/- 0.28 
 i   23.26 +/- 0.17 
 z   > 20.78 

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic 
extinction in the direction of the GRB. We thank the staff of the Observatorio 
Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.
