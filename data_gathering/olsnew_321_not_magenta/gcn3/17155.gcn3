The long-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 141207A (Fermi-LAT detection: 
Arimoto et al., GCN 17146; Fermi-GBM detection: Burns, GCN Circ. 17150) 
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=69081.298 s UT (19:11:21.298).

The burst light curve shows two pulses started at ~T0-2.3 s with a total 
duration of ~25 s.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB141207_T69081/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 4.87(-0.34,+0.38)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+6.224 s,
of 9.62(-2.26,+2.27)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+24.832 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.50 (-0.13,+0.14)
and Ep = 723(-72,+87) keV (chi2 = 105/98 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.6
(chi2 = 104/97 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
