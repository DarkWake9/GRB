A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. Cucchiara (GSFC/STScI), W. Fong (Arizona), D. Perley (DARK/NBI) report for a larger collaboration: 

“We obtained a second epoch of Gemini-North observations of the short GRB 160408A (Evans et al. GCN 19260, Palmer et al. GCN 19263) on 9 April 2016, approximately 22 hours after our previous observations. Although the images are somewhat shallower than the first epoch, the previously identified source A (Levan & Tanvir GCN 19262) has clearly faded by at least a magnitude between the two epochs, and is not detected in our new imaging. This confirms it as the optical afterglow of GRB 160408A.”
