G. B. Taylor (NRAO), D. A. Frail (NRAO), S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech),
and J. S. Bloom (Caltech) on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO collaboration 
report:

"On 1999 May 08.2 UT and 1999 May 09.2 UT we carried out VLA
observations at 8.4 GHz of the refined RXTE/IPN localization (Hurley
et al., GCN 298) for GRB 990506. Although there are four radio sources
stronger than 100 microJy in the field, none were shown to be
variable. The rms noise level of the images is approximately 30
microJy/beam. Further VLA observations are planned to monitor this
field.
