P. D'Avanzo, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. A. Evans (Univ Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.2 ks of XRT data for the Fermi GRB 130702A (Cheung et al. GCN 14971; Collazzi et al. GCN 14972), from 89.1 ks to 153.4 ks after the Fermi/GBM trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. We confirm the fading of the X-ray afterglow reported in D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 14973).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.57 (+0.21, -0.20).
