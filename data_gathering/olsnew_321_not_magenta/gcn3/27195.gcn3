In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200224ca at T0 = 2020-02-24
22:22:34.378 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows
that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less than 10%
of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV over time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of
the S200224ca 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

from 2.1e-07 to 2.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 65% of the
LR over the time interval (T0 - 100 s ; T0 s);

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
