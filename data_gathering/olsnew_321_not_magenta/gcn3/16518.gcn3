A.S. Moskvitin, V.N. Komarova, T.N. Sokolova, V.V. Sokolov (SAO RAS,
N. Arkhyz), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

We observed the GRB 140629A field (Lien et al., GCNC 16477)
with the 1-m SAO RAS telescope Zeiss-1000 on June, 30.
Observations started at 21:21:36 and ended at 23:48:49 UT.
22 x 300 sec. images in the Rc filter were obtained under good weather
conditions.

Unlike the previous night, the OT is not visible in single images,
but is clearly detectable in the stacked image. Based on the same
USNO-B1 star (Moskvitin et al., GCNC 16499; Bikmaev et al., GCNC 16482)
with R1_mag = 16.49, we measured the OT magnitude as R = 22.1 +/- 0.2
on the phase 1.35 days after the trigger.
