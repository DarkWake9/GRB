and S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 200623B
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 28017)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 614628173),
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT), so far,
at about 64968 s UT (18:02:48).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ----------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg               Dec(2000), deg
  ----------------------------------------------
  Center:
   343.079 (22h 52m 19s)  -53.378 (-53d 22' 41")
  Corners:
   330.417 (22h 01m 40s)  -61.535 (-61d 32' 06")
   328.804 (21h 55m 13s)  -63.180 (-63d 10' 48")
   349.757 (23h 19m 02s)  -41.929 (-41d 55' 45")
   348.242 (23h 12m 58s)  -43.351 (-43d 21' 04")
  ----------------------------------------------
The error box area is 17.6 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 24.5 deg (the minimum one is 46 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 115 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi-GBM final position (GCN Circ. 28017).

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
