A. DAi (INAF/IASFPA), E. Ambrosi (INAF/IASFPA), V. D'Elia (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team. 

Swift performed a second observation for the candidate Source 1 present
in the field of GRB 200709B/HAWC-200907A (Osborne  et al., GCN 28072), 
with a 3.0 ks exposure between T0+52.6 ks and T0+40.0 ks. Source 1 is still 
detected at the same flux level and it is therefore unlikely to be the afterglow. 

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
