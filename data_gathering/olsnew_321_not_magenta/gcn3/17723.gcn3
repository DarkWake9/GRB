J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), C. Pagani (U.
Leicester), V. D'Elia (ASDC), M. de Pasquale (INAF-IASFPA), A. Maselli 
(INAF-IASFPA), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti
(INAF-OAB/PSU) and C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.2 ks of XRT data for the Swift/BAT-detected burst
GRB 150413A (Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 17688). The data are entirely
in Photon Counting (PC) mode, collected between T0+303.3 ks and
T0+550.9 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit at the position of the optical
afterglow (Ivanov et al., GCN Circ. 17689) is 0.003 ct s^-1,
corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 1.2e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00637899.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
