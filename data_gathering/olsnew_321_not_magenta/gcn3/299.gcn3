TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  299
SUBJECT: GRB990506 observation plan
DATE:    99/05/07 23:17:44 GMT
FROM:    Fredrick J. Vrba at USNO  <fjv@nofs.navy.mil>

The U.S. Naval Observatory GRB team (F. J. Vrba, C. B. Luginbuhl,
A. A. Henden, S. E. Levine, J. Munn, B. Canzian, H. H. Guetter), 
D. H. Hartmann (Clemson Univ.), and M. C. Jennings (IGPP, UCR visitor)

reports that it intends to repeat observations of IPN/RXTE error box
for GRB990506 for comparison with data taken 7 May 1999 UT (for
pointing and observational details see GCN 294).  The data taken 7 May
reach an R magnitude of approximately 23-24, and we expect to reach
similar limits tonight.  If any variable sources are detected, we
expect to release the position and approximate photometric measures via
GCN by 0700-0800 UT 8 May 1999, which may be sufficient notice for
observers located further west.
