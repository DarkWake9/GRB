TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2224
SUBJECT: GRB 030501: final TAROT limits
DATE:    03/05/10 17:08:47 GMT
FROM:    Michel Boer at CESR-CNRS  <Michel.Boer@cesr.fr>

Alain Klotz and Michel Boer (CESR/CNRS/UPS), on behalf of the TAROT team 
report :

We co-added 25 unfiltered 30s duration frames, taken between 20s and 17min 
after GRB 030501 (Mereghetti et al., GCNC 2183). We do not detect any new 
source up to the limiting magnitude of R=18.0 .

The source reported in GCN Circ. 2188 is a bright infrared source as indicated 
by Fox et al (GCNC 2189). It was detected by TAROT because of its residual 
sensitivity to IR for the unfiltered images.

The data will be soon available on the TAROT site, and are already accessible 
through the following URL : http://www.cesr.fr/~klotz/grb030501
