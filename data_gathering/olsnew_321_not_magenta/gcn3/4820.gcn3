Using the partial data set from T-300 to T+302 sec from telemetry
downlinks, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060223 (trigger #192059)
(Cummings, et al., GCN 4813; Marshall et al, GCN 4814).
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec = 55.188,-17.130 deg
{3h 40m 45.1s, -17d 7' 46.6"} (J2000) +- 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment).  The BAT error circle contains the afterglow detected
by UVOT (GCN 4813).  The partial coding was 69%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single episode of emission
from T-4 to T+10 sec.   There is a possible broad, faint precursor
at ~T-25 sec, but no significant emission after T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 11 +- 2 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.9 to T+10.0 is best fit by a
simple power-law model. The power-law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.74 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
6.8 +- 0.5 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.  Given the redshift
reported for this burst (Berger et al, GCN 4815), z = 4.41, we calculate
Eiso = 2.82 10^52 ergs in the 81-812 keV band in the rest frame of the
source.
