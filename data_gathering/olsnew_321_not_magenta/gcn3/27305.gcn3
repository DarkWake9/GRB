S. Gupta, V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:
Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of the short GRB 200219A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM Final Real-time (GCN #27123), Swift (Lien A. et al., GCN #27125), MASTER (Tiurina N. et al., GCN #27126), Swift-BAT (Laha S. et al., GCN #27148), FRAM-Auger (Jelinek M. et al., GCN #27164), UVOT (Siegel M. et al., GCN #27165), Konus-Wind (Svinkin D. et al., GCN #27226) and ATCA 5/9 GHz (Antonio D. et al., GCN #27245).
The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed a single peak of emission peaking at 2020-02-19 07:36:49 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 426 +/- 30.7 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 413 +/- 4.4 cts. The local mean background count rate was 489 +/- 2.2 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 1.1 +/- 0.45 s.
It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.
CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site atÂ http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
