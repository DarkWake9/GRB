UVOT team

The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began
observations of GRB050607 on June 7, 2005 at 22:36:23 UT,
~12 hours and 25 minutes after the initial Swift BAT trigger
(Retter et al., GCN 3525) as an uploaded ToO. Immediate data
from UVOT were not available due to the instrument being in
an engineering mode.

No optical counterpart is detected at the afterglow position
(Rhoads, GCN 3527) in summed images from any filter down to
the following 3-sigma upper limits:

Filter   3-sig UL  Exposure (s)  T_mid (s)
V        20.21     2036          51530
B        20.95     897           46942
U        20.18     771           42806
UVW1     20.95     900           41963
UVM2     21.33     1482          46727
UVW2     21.30     900           47844

Where T_mid is the mid-time of the summed exposure in seconds
after the BAT trigger.

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points,
measured in orbit, and will require refinement with
further calibration.
