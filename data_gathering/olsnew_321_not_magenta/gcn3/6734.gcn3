SUBJECT: GRB 070810: ROTSE-III Detection of Optical Counterpart

H. Swan (U Mich), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), E.S. Rykoff (U 
Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 
070810 (Swift trigger 287364). The first image was at 02:34:02.5 UT, 
1330.5 s after the burst. The unfiltered images are calibrated relative 
to USNO A2.0. We detect a 16.7 magnitude, fading source with coordinates:

      12:39:51.48      +10:45:00.90    (J2000).

The source is blended with a nearby USNO star visible in the DSS, and 
thus our initial positional uncertainty is ~3".

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker 
database.

Continuing observations are in progress.
