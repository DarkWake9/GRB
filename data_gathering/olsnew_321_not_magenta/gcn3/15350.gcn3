Arne Henden (AAVSO), as part of a larger collaboration, reports:

We observed the field of GRB131018A using the Mt. John University Observatory 
Optical Craftsman 61cm telescope (part of AAVSOnet), with observations starting 
at 12:55:24 UT (7.6 minutes after the Swift trigger) under poor seeing 
conditions and bright moonlight.  We do not see any optical afterglow at the XRT 
position to a limiting magnitude of R=17 (using APASS calibrations).

[GCN OPS NOTE(18oct13): The "A' suffix was added to the GRB name.]
