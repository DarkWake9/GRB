We performed near-infared H-band observations of nearby galaxies
in the error circle of the gamma-ray transient candidate found
in the AGILE-GRID data, AGL J1914+1043 (Tavani et al. GCN 20754),
which is located at the edge of the skymap of G275404 (GCN 20738)
with 1.5m Kanata telescope on UT 2017-02-27. The instrument used
was an optical near-infrared simultaneous camera HONIR.

We found a bright near-infrared transient in the observed field of
GL191032+075314. The data was taken at 20:32UT on 2017-02-27. The
H-band AB magnitude of the source was 16.3 +- 0.02. The location
of the source is

     RA=19:10:31.46, DEC=+07:53:52.0 .

We also conducted an I-band observation for this area simultaneously.
No transient source was detected with the 5-sigma I-band limiting
magnitude of 19.6. There is no bright counterpart in 2MASS H-band
data, but a point source (SSTGLMC G042.1312-00.6118; in GLIMPSE I
Spring '07 Catalog) is clearly seen at the same position in 3.6 um
data taken by Spitzer GLIMPSE survey.

The observation log with 5-sigma limiting magnitudes is shown
below.
