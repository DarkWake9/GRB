C.G. Mundell and I.A. Steele (Liverpool JMU) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically followed up GRB100614A
(SWIFT trigger 424716; Stratta et al. GCN10837) 17.07 min after the GRB 
trigger time. Initial analysis shows no optical counterpart is detected in 
the XRT error circle to the following limiting magnitudes (wrt USNOB1):

Time from trigger      Filter  Limiting Mag
-----------------     -------  ------------
29 mins		         R      > 21 mag
31 mins			 i'	> 21 mag

We note also that no counterpart is detected in z'-band images.
