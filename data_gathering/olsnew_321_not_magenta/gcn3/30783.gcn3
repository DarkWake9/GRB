T. Laskar (University of Bath), K. D. Alexander (Northwestern), R. Margutti
(Berkeley), E. Berger (Harvard), W. Fong (Northwestern), R. Chornock
(Berkeley), C. G. Mundell (University of Bath), and P. Schady (University
of Bath) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 210905A (Sonbas et al. GCN 30765) with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 97.5 GHz beginning on 2021
September 05 23:41 UT (0.98 days after the burst).

Preliminary analysis reveals a mm source with flux density of ~ 0.1 mJy at
position:

RA (J2000) = 20:36:11.5685 (+/- 0.0002)
Dec (J2000) = -44:26:24.840 (+/- 0.002)

consistent with the X-ray position (Beardmore et al., GCN 30768) and
optical position (Strausbaugh & Cucchiara, GCN 30769).

We thank the JAO staff, AoD, P2G, and the entire ALMA team for their help
with these observations."
