A. N. Morgan (UC Berkeley) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 121209A (Maselli et al., GCN 14045) with the
1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began at
2012-Dec-10 01h16m41s UT, ~3.2 hours after the Swift trigger.  In  mosaics
(effective exposure time of 1940 s) taken simultaneously in the J, H, and
Ks filters, we do not detect any source within the XRT error circle.
