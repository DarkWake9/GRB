report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers

- 531092162/171030900 at 21:35:57.28 UT on 30 Oct 2017
- 531136196/171031410 at 09:49:51.21 UT on 31 Oct 2017

tentatively classified as GRBs, are in fact due to the Be X-ray Binary,
Swift J0243.6+6124 (RA = 40.9186 deg; Dec = 61.4323 deg). This source
was first reported by Cenko et al. (GCN #21960), and it is currently
rising in intensity, as seen in the Fermi-GBM Pulsar page:

https://gammaray.nsstc.nasa.gov/gbm/science/pulsars/lightcurves/swiftj0243.html

and in Kennea et al (GCN #21963), Beardmore (GCN #22020) and D'Avanzo
et al. (GCN #22067).

The trigger

- 531147620/171031542 at 13:00:15.13 UT on 31 Oct 2017

tentatively classified as having unreliable location,
upon further inspection is found to be caused by the same source.

During the active phase of this source we will not
issue individual corrections for mis-classified triggers."
