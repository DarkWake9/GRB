on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument found Triggers 114298/114299 (possibly GRB 050410) 
at 12:14:25 UT on 10 April 2005.  The target was within the Swift Earth 
constraint and the observatory executed a delayed automated slew to the BAT 
position at 12:44:20.  The XRT began taking data at 12:46:27 UT, about 32 
minutes after the burst.  The afterglow was too faint for the XRT to 
produce an on-board centroid.  Ground processing shows a faint uncataloged 
X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 05:59:12.9
Dec(J2000) = +79:36:9.2

We estimate an uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds radius (90% 
containment).   This source is located 38 arcseconds from the BAT position 
for Trigger 114299.
