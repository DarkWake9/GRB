TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  621
SUBJECT: GRB 000323, optical observations
DATE:    00/03/28 20:39:47 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) on behalf of the USNO GRB team, and
A. J. Castro-Tirado, INTA-LAEFF (Madrid) and IAA-CSIC (Granada)
and J. M. Castro Ceron, ROA (San Fernando) on behalf of
the large Spanish-Czech BOOTES team, report:

We have observed the entire error box of GRB 000323
(cf. Hurley et al., GCN#616), using the 0.3-m BOOTES-1
telescope and the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope.  The BOOTES-1
data is unfiltered, and covers about 90 percent of
the entire error box except for the extreme northern
and southern corners.  The USNO Cousins R-band data is a
north/south mosaic that covers about 60 percent of
the error box, missing the east and west corners.
The UT exposure dates, length, and limiting magnitudes are:

BOOTES-1  2000 March 25.00  1200seconds  R=19.5
USNO      2000 March 25.42   600seconds  R=21.5
USNO      2000 March 26.31  1200seconds  R=22.2


The BOOTES-1 frame does not go as deep as the POSS-II red
plate, but no new object is apparent from comparing the
CCD data with POSS-II.  The USNO datasets go somewhat
deeper than POSS-II, but no variable object is detected
brighter than R=21.5.

A BVRI single-night calibration of the central part
of the error box, taken on a photometric night in conjunction
with a large number of Landolt standards, can be found at
