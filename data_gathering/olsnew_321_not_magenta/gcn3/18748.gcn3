Swift has performed a series of 75 observations of galaxies (from the
GWGC catalogue) within the aLIGO error region for the aLIGO trigger
G211117, using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. The observations
currently span from 140 ks to 217 ks after the aLIGO trigger, and cover
8.4 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for overlaps).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected a 9 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 4 sources of rank 3
  * 5 sources of rank 4

We assumed a power-law spectrum with NH=3e20 cm^2, and Gamma=1.7

In addition to these sources a number of objects were detected and
reported in COUNTERPART notices, which are in fact artefacts around
extended sources, and are not point source detections. These spurious
sources are not reported below.

RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.
  
  Source 13:
  =============
    RA: 	 187.6968 ( = 12h 30m 47.23s)  J2000
    Dec:	 +12.3389 ( = +12d 20' 20.0")  J2000
    Error:	 +6.4 (radius, 90% confidence).
    Peak Rate:	 1.5e-01 +/- 5.4e-02 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV)
    Peak Flux:	 6.3e-12 +/- 2.3e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 keV)
    RASS UL:	 2.5e+00 ct/sec, 3-sigma, converted to XRT (0.3-10 keV)

       So the source is not significantly above the RASS 3-sigma limit
    There is no evidence for fading
    There is 1 GWGC galaxy within 200 kpc of the source.

    RASS UL:	 2.6e-01 ct/sec, 3-sigma, converted to XRT (0.3-10 keV)

  Source 44:
  =============

       So the source is not significantly above the RASS 3-sigma limit
    There is no evidence for fading
    NOTE: this source is not within 200 kpc of a GWGC galaxy.


RANK 4 sources
==============

These are catalogued X-ray sources, showing no signs of outburst
compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.
