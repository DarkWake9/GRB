and J. S. Deng(NAOC) report: 

We began to observe GRB 210205A (Dichiaraet al., GCN 29397)
with Xinglong GWAC-F60A telescope, China, 
at 11:13:26 (UT), 5th. Feb. 2021, about 129 sec after the burst.

A series of  R, I, and B band images were obtained.
Preliminary analysis shows that no any new optical source
are found in single images within the XRT errorbox (Dichiaraet al., GCN 29397). 

The 3 sigma upper limit is about 17.3 mag in R band 
at the mean time of 134 sec after the burst,
calibrated to the USNO B1.0 catalog.
