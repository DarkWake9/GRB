SUBJECT: GRB 190326A: Swift detection of a short burst

M. H. Siegel (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester)
and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 07:35:28 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190326A (trigger=895006).  Due to an observing constraint, 
Swift did not slew to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 341.652, +39.903 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 46m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = +39d 54' 09"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 0.1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 12:47 UT on 2019 April 13. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. H. Siegel (siegel AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
