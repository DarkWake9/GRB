TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8487
SUBJECT: Swift-XRT observations of GRB 081105
DATE:    08/11/06 15:41:23 GMT
FROM:    Andy Beardmore at U Leicester  <apb@star.le.ac.uk>

A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) and J. Cummings (GSFC/UMBC)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT  team.

The Swift-XRT started observing the field of the Swift-BAT and IPN
localization GRB 081105 (Cummings et al., GCN 8484) at
2008-11-06 05:18:07(UT), 15.8 hours after the trigger.

In an exposure of 5ks we detect an X-ray source within the BAT error
circle at RA, Dec = 3.95224, 3.47098, which is
RA  (J2000) =  00:15:48.5
Dec (J2000) = +03:28:15.5
with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcsec (radius, 90 percent confidence).

The observed count rate is (7.6+/-2.0)e-3 count/s. At this stage we cannot
tell whether the source is fading. Further Swift observations are planned.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
