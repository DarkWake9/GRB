report:

We observed LIGO/Virgo S190814bv (Mo et al, GCN Circ. 25324) with the
DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) on the night of
2019-08-15 UTC.

We observed approximately 100 square degrees with three visits centered on
00:51:19.690 -25:14:28.9, 00:50:55.478 -27:15:38.84, and 00:52:24.972
-22:31:44.59, respectively. These regions include about 90% of the
probability in the updated localization map (Mo et al, GCN Circ. 25333). We
observed from 2019-08-15 07:58 UTC to 2019-08-15 11:52 UTC (10.8 to 14.7
hours after the event). We obtained about 20 minutes total exposure on each
field in the w filter.

We calibrate our images against the APASS catalog. Our 10-sigma limiting
magnitude are typically w = 18.0 AB.

Comparing our 10-sigma detections against the USNO-B1 catalog, we detect no
uncataloged sources with significant fading.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro
Martir.
