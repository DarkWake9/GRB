SUBJECT: GRB 060219: SDSS galaxy inside XRT error circle

A. Moretti (INAF/OABr) reports on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

We looked at the SDSS images of GRB 060219 (Moretti et al., GCN 4788; 
Barthelmy et al., GCN 4795) provided by Cool et al. (GCN 4789). Inside 
the revised XRT error circle (Moretti et al., GCN 4797) there is a faint 
object at the coordinates (J2000):

alpha = 16:07:21.28;
delta = +32:18:58.33.

This source is visible in the g, r, i and z frames. After coadding the 
g, r, and i frames (a saturation spike contaminates the z-band image), 
the object has extended appearance, being elongated along the N/S 
direction with FWHM~2.5", and may thus be a galaxy.

The object has (AB) magnitudes r~21.6, i~20.6, z~20.0, calibrated 
against nearby SDSS sources.

This message can be cited.
