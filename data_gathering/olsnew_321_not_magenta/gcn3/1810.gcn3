J.L. Atteia, M. Boer, and A. Klotz communicate:
The TAROT robotic observatory reacted within seconds to the HETE trigger H 2533 
= GRB 030215 (see also GCN Circ. 1805 to 1808). The images started at 4h35 UT, 
i.e. 1h13m after the burst. 38 exposures of 30s each have been taken with a 
Cousin B filter. 
We do not see any obviously variable object. A stacked image of total duration 
1140s has been computed with a limiting B magnitude about 19.1. It is posted at 
the following URL: http://tarot.cesr.fr/tarot1/grb030115.htm . We do not 
confirm the possible OT detection reported by Castro-Tirado et al. in GCN # 
1805.
