collaboration report:

We are following the decay of the optical afterglow of GRB 050922C
(Norris et al., GCN 4013) with the ESO VLT+FORS1. 
Multi-band BVR photometry was carried out on September 24 at 00:10 UT,
about 1.2 days after the high-energy event.
A preliminary calibration, based on Landolt standard stars, have been
performed and the OT magnitude in the R band was:

R = 21.57 +/- 0.05 

confirming the break in the light curve reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN
4040).
