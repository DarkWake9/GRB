G. Wegner (Dartmouth), P. Garnavich (Notre Dame), J. L. Prieto,
and K. Z. Stanek (OSU) report:

We observed the position of GRB 080310 (Chornock et al. GCN 7381;
Cummings et al., GCN 7382) with the Large Binocular Telescope
(LBC red and blue cameras) on March 13.40 (UT) and with the
MDM 2.4-m Hiltner telescope (Retrocam) on March 14.39 (UT) through
Sloan-r filters.

Using stars calibrated by the SDSS, we estimate the following
r-band magnitudes:

age (days)  r mag   error   telescope
3.04        22.45    0.05     LBT
4.03        23.10    0.10     MDM

The photometry indicates that the afterglow has resumed a steep
decline. Including LBT photometry from March 12 (Garnavich et al.,
GCN 7414), we estimate a power-law decline index of 2.1 between
2 and 4 days after the burst.
