S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and
ISDC,Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:01:15 UT of 2018 July 14.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 242.9191 deg
DEC.= 33.2811  deg

with an uncertainty of 2.5    arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.3    counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration  time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 3x10^-7
erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
