A. A. Djupvik (NOT), Y. Martinez-Osorio (NOT) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We observed the BAT field of GRB 130829A (Grupe et al., GCN 15131)
using the 2.5 Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with StanCam. We
obtained 4x300s R-band frames at a mean time of 20:46 UT on
2013-08-29, i.e., 15.05 hr after the BAT trigger. Observations were
carried out at high airmass, and the resulting seeing was about 1
arcsec. Our images cover 96% of the BAT error circle.

Our image reaches a depth comparable to the SDSS, roughly R = 22.7.
Visual comparison between our data and the SDSS image reveals no new
source within the BAT error circle.
