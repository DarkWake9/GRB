S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 15 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 06:46:20  UT of November 27, 2018. The burst was
detected  with a significance below the threshold for  automatic alert
delivery (IBAS Weak Alert n.8167 was distributed at
06:46:50 UT).

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=  285.3433 deg
DEC.=   31.6895 deg

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.5    counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration  time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 4e-7
erg/cmq.
