GRB 041219: PAIRITEL IR Observations, < 3 minutes after trigger

J. S. Bloom (CfA/UCB) reports on behalf of a larger group:

"Responding to the IBAS Alert #2073, we imaged the field of the (possible)
GRB 041219 starting at 19 Dec 2004 01h49m18 UT, about 2.8 minutes after
the GRB (imaging is on-going). A quick comparison with the 2MASS Quicklook
J-band images reveals no obvious new source. The imaging depth is deeper
than 2MASS. A more detailed analysis is on-going."
