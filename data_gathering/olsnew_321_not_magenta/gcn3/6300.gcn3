M. Uemura, A. Arai, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.), 
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We took optical and IR images of the field of GRB070418 (GCN 6299) at 
11:24-11:46 UT 18 Apr. using TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 
1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan.  
We obtained 10 sets of V, J, and Ks-band images with a 123, 120, 
and 96-s exposure time, respectively.  

We cannot find any new objects brighter than 18.4, 15.7, and 13.8 mag
in V-, J-, and Ks-band, respectively, using the USNO A2.0 and 
2MASS catalog.

Our observation continues.
