We observed the field of the transient iPTF14yb (Cenko et al., GCN 15883, Beardmore et al.,
GCN 15884) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) 
on the1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/02 27.28 to 2014/02 27.54 UTC (20.53 to 26.68 hours 
after the reported time of discovery), obtaining a total of 3.91 hours exposure in the 
r and i bands and 1.64 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For the source reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 15883), in comparison with the 
SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

 r	22.28 +/- 0.09
 i	22.02 +/- 0.09
 Z	21.98 +/- 0.24
 Y	22.12 +/- 0.35
 J	21.88 +/- 0.35
 H	> 21.59

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the transient.

Our photometry indicates that the transient is fading in r band according to a
single power law with temporal index alpha=1.04. This behavior is also typical
of a long gamma-ray burst type transient as suggested by Cenko et al. (GCN 15883)

Mártir.
