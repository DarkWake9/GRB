The reality of the Swift-BAT trigger 147325 is still being evaluated by the BAT team. 
We emphasize that the XRT Position sent out in the GCN Notice is INCORRECT. 
The XRT centroid coordinates are coincident with the K0 star CD-2510801 (SAO183285, Vmag ~ 6).
Should the trigger be confirmed as a GRB, an XRT position will be determined by the analysis of the full data following the next ground station pass.
