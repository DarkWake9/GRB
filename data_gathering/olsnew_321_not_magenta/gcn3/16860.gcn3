J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC/UPV-EHU), S. Hellmich (DLR), S. Mottola (DLR), on
behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We observed the GRB 140930B (De Pasquale GCN 16857) field with the 1.23m
CAHA telescope. The observations were carried out in the R-band on Sep
30.82728-30.86076 UT (9.6-57.8 minutes post GRB). A very preliminary
analysis does not reveal any optical source consistent with the enhanced
XRT position (Evans et al. GCN 16859) brighter than R(Vega)~21, calibrated
against the USNO B1.0 catalog. A further analysis is ongoing.
