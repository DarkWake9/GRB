E. Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:37:37.94 UT on 10 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140710B (trigger 426721060 / 140710901).
which was also detected by INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI
(Gotz et al., GCN 16576).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the refined INTEGRAL
position (Gotz et al., GCN 16578).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 30.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-56 s to T0+68 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.9 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.3 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.2s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.7 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
