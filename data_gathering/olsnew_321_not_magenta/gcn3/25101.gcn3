S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 40 s has been detected by the off-line IBAS
analysis in the  IBIS/ISGRI data at 03:14  UT of 2019 July 19.
No alerts have been  distributed because the real-time IBAS program were
 not running at the time of the burst.

The burst refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 344.518 deg
DEC.=  59.858 deg

with an uncertainty of  2.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of  0.1    counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 4e-7  erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
