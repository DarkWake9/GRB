report:

The optical afterglow of GRB 130831A (GCN 15139, D. Palmer) was
observed with 1.5-m Russian-Turkish Telescope RTT150 at Bakyrlytepe
(TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). The observation started at
2013-09-01 00:42:03 UT, appr. 12 hours after the burst.

Two images each with exposure 300 seconds were obtained in R-band:

1. UT = 00:42:03.678; t-t0 = 11.630h; m_R = 19.57 +- 0.02
2. UT = 00:48:35.373; t-t0 = 11.739h; m_R = 19.62 +- 0.03
 
Images are calibrated using stars proposed by Pozanenko et al. (GCN
15190). The magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction.
