P. Veres (UAH)
reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team and the GBM+LIGO/Virgo Working
Group:


At the time of S190510g, Fermi was passing through the South Atlantic
Anomaly therefore the GBM detectors were disabled.

We note that the Fermi-GBM trigger (190510120 / 579149538) that occurred
about 7 minutes prior to the LVC trigger is a long gamma-ray burst that is
unassociated with S190510g based on the preliminary bayestar map.
