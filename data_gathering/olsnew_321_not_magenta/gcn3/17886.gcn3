(INAF-OAB), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti
(INAF-OAB/PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester),
C. Pagani (U. Leicester) and A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed  of XRT data for the Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB
150513A (Lien et al. GCN Circ. 17814), collecting 5.0 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+1309.8 ks and T0+1322.8 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit at the Swift/BAT position is
0.001 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 5.8e-14
to  erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00640584.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
