TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  5947
SUBJECT: GRB 061217 - Swift/XRT position correction 
DATE:    06/12/21 15:57:57 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans, K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and J.A. Kennea (PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The XRT position of GRB 061217 reported in GCN Circ. 5932 was incorrect
due to analysis of the early XRT data being compromised by the faintness
of the source and its proximity to the hot columns. Having reprocessed
the complete set of XRT observations of GRB 061217, we find the
corrected position to be:

RA (J2000) :  10 41 39.10
Dec (J2000): -21 07 26.9

with an uncertainty of 6.0" (90% confidence).

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
