S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL)
and T. Sakamoto (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 04:31:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on an outburst
1E 1841-045 (aka Kes 73) (trigger=526660).  Swift did not slew because it was
given a low merit value (as is typical for known-source triggers). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 280.349, -4.958, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 41m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = -04d 57' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike with a
duration less than 64 msec.  The peak count rate was ~1800 counts/sec
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.  We note that BAT previously
triggered on this source on 02 July 2011. 

There is a known SGR at this location.
