report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a 
long bright burst, GRB 211229B, at 2021-12-29T22:18:43.150 UTC (denoted as T0)ï¼Œ
which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #31336).

This burst mainly consists of multiple pulses with duration of about 15 s.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
