We observed the field of GRB 170604A (Page, et al., GCN 21191) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/06 5.39 to 2017/06 5.45 UTC (14.19 to
15.70 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.84 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.42 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Page, et al., GCN 21196),
in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections:

  r = 20.42 +/- 0.06
  i = 20.65 +/- 0.07
  Z = 20.45 +/- 0.13
  Y = 20.40 +/- 0.30

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
