Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121031A (trigger #537195)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 13934).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 170.772, -3.513 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 23m 05.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -03d 30' 47.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like peak with a couple smaller peaks
superposed.  It starts at ~T-10 sec, peaks at ~T+4 sec, and ends at ~T+100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 62.5 +- 25.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.64 to T+98.31 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.59 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
