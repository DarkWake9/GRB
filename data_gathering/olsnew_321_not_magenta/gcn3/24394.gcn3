(UC Berkeley) report on behalf of the Lick/KAIT follow-up team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the IceCube neutrino candidate event
IceCube-190503A (GCN 24378). We observed 54 galaxies within the
IceCube error circle that were selected from the Glade catalog V1.0
(Dalya et al., 2018, MNRAS, 479, 2374; http://aquarius.elte.hu/glade/)
according to their priority score and elevation visibility, with each
clear-filter exposure time being 60 s. The first image was taken at
04:39:59, May 04 UT, about 11.3 hours after the trigger, and the last
image at 05:45:42 UT. Template images were obtained next night on
May 05 , 2019. The images were processed through the KAIT
subtraction pipeline to search for potential optical counterparts.
No viable transients were identified and the analysis is ongoing.
Our typical limiting mag is 19.0. A full list of galaxies observed
by KAIT is given below.
