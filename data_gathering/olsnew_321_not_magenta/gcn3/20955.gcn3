The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170317A (LaPorte et al., GCN 20885) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 17.59, Mar 18.78, Mar 
20.79 and Mar 22.78 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 20887), with 3sigma upper limits of 126 
uJy, 246 uJy, 84 uJy and 111 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
