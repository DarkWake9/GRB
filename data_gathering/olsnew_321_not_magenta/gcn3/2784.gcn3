Klotz, A., Boer M., G. Stratta, and Atteia J-L. report:

TAROT observed the HETE alert #3570
on 2004 Oct. 06, 19:55 UT (middle time).
The telescope took a series of 12 x 100-s unfiltered images
of the afterglow reported by
G. Da Costa et al. (GCN 2765)

We co-added frames to obtain a single image.
Comparing to the USNO-1B catalog and DSS
image, we are able to detect all stars
brighter than R=19.4 but the afterglow
is not visible.

The candidate proposed by Da Costa et al. (GCN 2765)
is not detected at the 3 sigma level. We conclude that the
afterglow had a magnitude R > 19.4.
