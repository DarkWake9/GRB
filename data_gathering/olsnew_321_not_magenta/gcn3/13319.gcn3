Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120521C detected by SWIFT
(trigger 522656) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 23 min after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from
68 degrees above horizon but humidity was higher
than 93% until 23 min after the trigger preventing
the record of the beginning of the event.

We co-added a series of exposures.
No OT was found in the XRT error box (Baumgartner
et al. GCNC 13318).

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
