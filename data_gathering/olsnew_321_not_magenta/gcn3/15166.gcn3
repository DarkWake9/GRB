G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) and F. Nocentini (Frosinone, Italy)
report:

On Sept 1.9197 2013 UT, we imaged the field around GRB
130831A (GCN 15139) 
remotely using the the 0.43m-f/6.8 robotic unit part of the
Virtual
Telescope robotic facility in Italy, about 33 hours after
the burst.

We co-added 12, 300-seconds unfiltered CCD images and
detected the afterglow at the same position we gave in GCN
15152. 

We performed photometry, assuming R-mags from UCAC-4 for the
stars in the
field, getting an estimate for the magnitude of 20.7 (CR).
