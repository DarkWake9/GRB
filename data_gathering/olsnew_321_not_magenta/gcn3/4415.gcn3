"We used the Very Large Array to observe the Swift burst GRB051227
(GCN 4397) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2005 December 28.57 UT and
December 29.22 UT. No radio emission is detected within the XRT error
circle (GCN 4402). At the position of the optical afterglow (GCN 4408)
the formal flux density values are -21 +/- 28 uJy and 18 +/- 25,
respectively.

No further observations are planned.
