Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170629A (trigger #759159)
(Cholden-Brown et al., GCN Circ. 21283).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 129.963, -46.585 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  08h 39m 51.0s 
  Dec(J2000) = -46d 35' 06.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 17%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts 
at ~ T-1 s and ends at ~T+40 s. There are roughly two overlapping 
pulses with peaks at ~ T+1 s and ~ T+5 s, respectively.  The burst location 
went out of the FOV at around T+240 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 34.4 +- 12.7 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.21 to T+39.32 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.66 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.96 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.1 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
