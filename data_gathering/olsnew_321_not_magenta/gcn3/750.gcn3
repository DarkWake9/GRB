E. Berger (Caltech), D. A. Frail (NRAO), and K. Becker (Oberlin) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the BeppoSax error circle for GRB000620 (GCN #718)
using the VLA on several occasions starting on June 20.93 UT.
Observations at 4.86 and 8.46 GHz revealed only one uncatalogued source
inside the combined BeppoSax+IPN error region (GCN #723). The position
of the source is RA: 07:34:52.9, DEC: 69:09:07.8 with a conservative
1" error in both. We observed this source on six different days,
ending 19 days after the burst. There is no evidence that the source
is varying substantially at either frequency. We therefore conclude
that it is unlikely that this source is the radio afterglow of
GRB000620."
