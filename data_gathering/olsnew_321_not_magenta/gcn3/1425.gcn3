TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB020604, optical observations

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We imaged an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the coordinates
for the IPN burst GRB020604 (Hurley et al., GCN 1417)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on 020608.295 (3.7d after
the burst), and again on 020611.276.  Coadded images give
a plate limit of V=21.5.  No new object was seen within
the CCD field of view, which does not contain the entire
160 square arcmin error box.  This field is at galactic coordinates
349.07, +13.12 and so is cluttered with stars, with few
extragalactic objects seen.

One object, present on the digitized plates available from
the USNO Pixel Server (http://www.nofs.navy.mil), exhibits
large variability.  Located at
  16:27:38.28  -29:47:38.0  J2000
with astrometric error under 100mas, the object was V=18.9
on 020608 and V=21.4 on 020611.
