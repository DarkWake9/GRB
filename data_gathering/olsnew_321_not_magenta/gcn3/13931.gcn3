We observed GRB 121024A in RIzY-bands starting at UT 10:52:00, 2012-10-24,
~ 9 hrs after the BAT trigger (Baumgartner et al, GCN 10484),
using the 1.0m telescope at Mt.Lemmon in Arizona, U.S.

We do not detect the GRB afterglow in all bands within the error circle
of the enhanced XRT position (Evans et al.,GCN 13892).
We estimate the 3-sigma limiting magnitude of the afterglow to be
R ~ 20.0 at the midpoint time (~T0+9.3 hrs)
by calibrating it against seven USNO-B1 stars with R2 magnitudes
without the galactic extinction correction.

We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon, for performing the observation.
