report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of the Optical Transient AT2019wxt/PS19hgw
(McBrien et al. GCN 26485), with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 
(VLA)
beginning on 2019 Dec 20 00:07 UT  in radio band C and K.
Analysis is complicated by a nearby bright radio source, coincident with 
the
host galaxy. Based on preliminary analysis, in 1 hour of observations we 
do
not detect any radio emission at the position of the OT to a 3-sigma 
limit of
174 uJy at 6 GHz (C-band) and 30 uJy at 22 GHz (K-band).

We thank Amy Mioduszewski and the rest of the VLA staff for their
assistance with rapidly approving and executing these observations.
