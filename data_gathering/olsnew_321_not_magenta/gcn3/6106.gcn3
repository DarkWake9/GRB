TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6106
SUBJECT: GRB 070219: ROTSE-III Optical Limits 
DATE:    07/02/19 02:33:38 GMT
FROM:    Heather Swan at U.of Michigan/ROTSE  <hflewell@umich.edu>

H. Swan (U Mich), J. Aretakis (U Mich) report on behalf of the ROTSE  
collaboration:
ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB  
070219 (Swift trigger 261132), producing images beginning 35 minutes  
after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image  
at 01:44:52.6 UT, 2076.5 s after the burst, under twilight  
conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 6 60-sec eposures. These  
unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within  
the 3-sigma error circle, for both single images and coadding into  
sets of 10. Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from  
15.8-17.0; we set the following specific limits.
