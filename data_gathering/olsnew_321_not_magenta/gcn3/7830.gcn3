S. T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-IASFPA)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 080605 (Sbarufatti et
al. 2008, GCN Circ. 7828) with a 99 s white exposure starting 104 s
after the BAT trigger.  The preliminary Swift/UVOT position of the
optical afterglow candidate is

  RA(J2000.0) =  17:28:30.07
Dec(J2000.0) = +04:00:56.0

with an estimated position uncertainty of 1.0 arcsec.  There is a
known source (USNO-B1.0 940-028965) 3 arcsec from this position.
