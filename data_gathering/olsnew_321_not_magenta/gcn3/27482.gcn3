The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:30:16 UT on 3 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200403A (trigger 607642221.34614 / 200403896).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 81.3, Dec = 73.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 25m, 73d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 161.0 degrees.
