A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), and F. Aceituno,
D.A. Kann, L. Izzo, C. Thoene (IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 170626A (Marshal et al. GCN 21264)
with the 1.5m OSN telescope in Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada,
Spain). Observation consisted of a series of 240 s R-band exposures,
starting at 20:56:49 UT (11.32 hr after the burst). The afterglow is well 
detected at a position consistent with the one reported by Moskvitin et 
al. (GCN 21268), (J2000, +/-0.5‚Äù):

R.A.: 11:01:34.09
Dec.: +56:28:35.4

In the combination of the first 12x240s exposures we measure a 
magnitude of R(AB) = 20.6+/- 0.2 as compared to SDSS stars.
