report:

Beginning at October 7.213 (t[burst] + 16.80 hr) and continuing until 
October 8.286 (t[burst] + 42.57 hr), Chandra Low Energy Transmission 
Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) observations were conducted of a field 
centered on the optical afterglow candidate (Da Costa et al, GCN2765) for 
GRB041006, which was localized by the HETE WXM instrument (Galassi et al, 
GCN2770).  We have detected a moderately bright, fading X-ray afterglow 
consistent in position with the optical source.  Over the 86.3 ksec of data 
accumulation (livetime) for the Chandra observations, the mean counting rate 
was 0.010 counts/s in the dispersed 1st order LETGS spectrum and 0.007 
counts/s in the 0ther order.  The source we detected faded in brightness 
according to a power law, with a decay time slope of -1.0 +/- 0.1.  We fit 
the 0th order and 1st order data jointly, requiring 20 or more counts per 
spectral bin.  An absorbed power-law model provides an acceptable fit 
(chi^2/nu = 66.2/63), with the following best-fit paramters over the
0.5-6 keV range:

dN/dE = A * exp[-nH*s(E)] * E^ (-gamma) ph cm^(-2) s^(-1) keV^(-1) ,
with:

A = (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(-4) , 
gamma = 1.9+/-0.2 , and
nH = (1.1+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^(-2). 

The measured value of nH exceeds the anticipated Galactic column density 
(nH = 2.9 x 10^20 cm^(-2)) in the source direction.  We measure a
mean flux in the 0.5 to 6 keV band over the duration of the Chandra 
observation of ~3.7 x 10^(-13) ergs cm^(-2) s^(-1).

Our analyses are continuing, and more detailed results will be posted at:

We thank Harvey Tananbaum and the Chandra X-ray Observatory Operations 
personnel, particularly Jeremy Drake and Brad Wargelin, for the impressive 
promptness with which this observation was planned and carried out.
