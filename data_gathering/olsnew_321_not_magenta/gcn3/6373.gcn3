R.L.C. Starling, P.A. Evans, K.L. Page and A. Beardmore (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have further analysed the Swift XRT data for GRB 070429A (Barthelmy 
et al., GCN Circ. 6355) out to 290 ks since the BAT trigger. 
The steep lightcurve decay reported in GCN Circ. 6363 has broken at 
T+1100 s to a slope of alpha~0.37. This plateau phase continues through 
the observations to date, out to about T0+290 ks, with a current count
rate of
~0.006 count/s corresponding to a flux of 1.8e-12 erg/cm^-2/s. Probable
X-ray flaring activity is seen during this phase.

The duration of the plateau phase is longer than that normally observed
in GRBs showing a similar phase (e.g. Nousek et al. 2006; O'Brien et al.
2006),
hence the source remains X-ray bright. 
Continuation of optical and infrared observations of GRB 070429A is
therefore
strongly encouraged. 

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
