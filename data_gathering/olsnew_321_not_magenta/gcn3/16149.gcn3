We observed the field of GRB 140419A Swift GRB 140419A (Marshall et al., GCN
16118) in R-band using the 1-m telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical Observatory
(LOAO) in Arizona, US

We obtained R-band images at two epochs on Apr. 19 and on Apr. 21. 
We marginally identify the afterglow in a stacked image for each night. 
The photometry is based on R1-mag of USNO-B1 stars in the observed field.

Details of Photometry are below:
