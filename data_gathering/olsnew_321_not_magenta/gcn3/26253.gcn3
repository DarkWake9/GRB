The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:08:28 UT on 17 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191117A (trigger 595642113.724042 / 191117006).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 297.9, Dec = 76.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 51m, 76d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 39.0 degrees.
