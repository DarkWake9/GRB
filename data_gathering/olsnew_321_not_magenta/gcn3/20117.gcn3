R. Hamburg (UAH) and P. Jenke (MSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

â€œThe Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 499467682/161029876
at 21:01:19.00 UT on 29 October 2016, tentatively classified as a GRB,
is in fact not due to a GRB. This trigger is due to local particles.

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
by the GBM Flight Software owing to the high fluence
of the particle event. This ARR was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to
the GBM in-flight location."
