The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:08:40 UT on 12 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200412B (trigger 608375325.70677 / 200412381).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 279.8, Dec = 64.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 39m, 64d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 57.0 degrees.
