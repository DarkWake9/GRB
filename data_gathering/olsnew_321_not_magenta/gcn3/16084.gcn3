P. Jenke (UAH), G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:15:55.24 UT on April 8 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140408A (trigger 418655758/140408553),
which was also detected by Swift (V. D'Elia et al. 2014, GCN 16082).  
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one main peak with a duration
 (T90) of about 13 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.1 s to T0+10.2s is
well fit by a power law with an index of -1.61 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.8 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.0 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
