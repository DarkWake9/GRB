S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), M. M. Chester (PSU), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI)
and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:28:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located V 404 Cyg (trigger=645176).  Swift did not slew to this new trigger
because the merit value of this new trigger was less than the previous trigger. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 306.002, +33.859, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 24m 00s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 51' 33"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, there is nothing
significant in the real-time light curve.
