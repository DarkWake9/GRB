D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC) reports:

At the afterglow position (Hu et al., GCN #30823, see also Pankov et 
al., GCN #30825) of the Swift GRB 210912A (Troja et al., GCN #30820), an 
object is visible in Pan-STARRS pre-imaging at position (J2000):

RA = 129.89171813
Dec. = +79.22157927

in agreement with the position given by Hu et al., GCN #30823,

with magnitudes:

g' = 23.19 +/- 0.23 mag,
r' = 23.09 +/- 0.36 mag,
i' = 22.48 +/- 0.13 mag,
z' = 22.43 +/- 0.25 mag.

It is undetected in Y.

We suggest this object to be the host galaxy of GRB 210912A. This may be 
indicative that this is a low-redshift event which may be followed by a 
detectable supernova.

Further follow-up despite the very northerly position is warranted.
