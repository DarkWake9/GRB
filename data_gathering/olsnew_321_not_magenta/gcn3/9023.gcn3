V. Connaughton, M. Briggs, and C. Meegan, on behalf of the Fermi GBM
team, report:

MESSENGER (GRNS) and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) have so far observed
GRB090323 (Ohno et al. GCN 9021).  We have triangulated this
burst to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Dec = 149.980, +11.232,
whose radius is 39.826 +/- 0.286 degrees (3 sigma).  This
annulus intersects the GBM localization, and the LAT localization
lies 0.007 degrees from the center line of this annulus.  A 
map has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/090323 showing the
GBM contours and best-fit position, the IPN annulus, and the LAT
best-fit position and error circle.

The IPN localization may be improved.
