We observed the field of GRB 180325A (Troja et al., GCN 22532) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/03 25.12 to 2018/03 25.23
UTC (1.02 to 3.67 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
1.47 hours exposure in the r and i bands and hours exposure in the Z, Y,
J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9 catalog, we obtain the following detections:

  r	= 19.79 +/- 0.02
  i	= 19.38 +/- 0.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
