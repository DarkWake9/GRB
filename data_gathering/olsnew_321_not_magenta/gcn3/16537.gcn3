Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:33:33.86 UT on 06 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140706A (trigger 426368016 / 140706815)
which was also detected by Swift (Marshall et al. 2014, GCN 16531).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The GBM light curve consists of two main peaks with a total duration 
of about  47.5 s (50-300keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-18 s 
to T0+39 s is well fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.37 +/- 0.15 and the 
cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 96 +/- 19 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.95 +/- 0.28)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.58 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 2.9 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final 
results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
