The long-duration GRB 160623A (Mailyan et al., GCN Circ. 19555; 
Vianello et al. GCN Circ. 19553; Mingo et al. GCN Circ. 19558; 
Frederiks et al. GCN Circ. 19554) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray 
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 04:59:34.27 on 23 June 2016.   The burst signal 
was seen by all CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a bright peak with several overlapping pulses.  
The emission starts at T0, peaks at T0+12 sec and ends at T0+40 sec.  
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 13.5 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV).  
The light curve is available at

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
