TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7641
SUBJECT: GRB 080426: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    08/04/26 18:42:21 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 894 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
data for GRB 080426, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 26.49890, +69.46823 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 01h 45m 59.74s
Dec (J2000): +69d 28' 05.6"

with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest position
can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position enhancement is
described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf), the current algorithm is an
extension of this method.

This circular was automatically generated, and is an official product of the
Swift-XRT team.
