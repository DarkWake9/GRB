(LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080727 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 318170) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 790.7s after the GRB trigger
(765.8s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
from 38 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-07-27T23:07:35.040

At the enhanced XRT position given by Osborne et al.
(GCN #8038) we do not detect any optical transient.

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+857.5s to t0+1850.1s : R > 18.5

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=131.4275 lat= +2.5930
and the galactic extinction in R band is 2.8 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
