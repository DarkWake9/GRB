S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. Kennea (PSU), J. Racusin (GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:19:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120624B (trigger=525068) (also detected by Fermi-GBM, Circ 13377
and Fermi-LAT, Circ 13379).  There were no real-time notices
for this event because it occurred during a TDRSS outage (22:07 to 22:46),
so none of the normal sequence of real-time notices were available.
There was no automated slew to this BAT trigger because of a Moon constraint.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 170.94, 8.93 (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment,
including systematic uncertainty).  We are in the process of getting
the full data set downlinked,  and will produce the nomal "refined"
circular when it becomes available.

[GCN OPS NOTE905jul12): Per author's request, the Trigger Time has been
changed from 22:19:51 to 22:19:33.66 UT.  We apologize for the mistake.
We thank Frank Marshall for bring the mistake to our attention.]
