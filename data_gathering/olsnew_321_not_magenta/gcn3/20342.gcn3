We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 161219B (Dâ€™Ai et al. GCN 
20296) with OSIRIS at the 10.4m GTC telescope on La Palma (Spain). 
The observations consisted of 3 x 900 s spectra using grism R1000B, 
which covers the spectral region between 3700 and 7800 AA, plus g, r, i 
and z-band imaging. The point-like GRB counterpart is prominent on top 
of the elongated host galaxy.

The combined spectrum has mean UT epoch on 27.02 December (7.24 
days after the burst) and shows a strong continuum with clear broad 
features typical of a type Ic-BL supernova, implying that the supernova 
contribution is already significant. We also detect several emission 
features of the host galaxy (due to [OIII], [OII], [NII] and H) as well as CaII 
in absorption at the redshift of z = 0.1475 proposed for the GRB (Tanvir 
et al. GCN 20321).
