Dale A. Frail (NRAO), Poonam Chandra (RMC), S. Bradley Cenko
(Berkeley) and Fiona Harrison (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We used the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) to observe the field of
view towards the Fermi GBM/LAT burst GRB 100414A (GCN 10594, 10595,
10649) on April 27.18 UT at a center frequency of 8.46 GHz.  We detect
the radio afterglow with flux density of 397 ± 15 microJy at the
position of the optical afterglow detected by GROND (GCN 10607).

Further observations are planned.

The EVLA is still undergoing active commissioning and we caution that
these results should be considered preliminary. The National Radio
Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation
operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc."
