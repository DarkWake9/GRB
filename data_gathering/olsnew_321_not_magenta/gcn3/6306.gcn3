SUBJECT: GRB 070419: P60 Confirmation of Optical Afterglow

S. B. Cenko (Caltech) and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB070419 (Stamatikos et al., GCN 6302) with
the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  The candidate identified by
Chornock et al. (GCN 5304) is visible in our images and variable; we
therefore confirm it is the optical afterglow of GRB070419.  Specifically,
we measure the following R-band magnitudes:

Mean Date	Time Since Burst	Magnitude
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
10:05:18	5.87 min		19.7
10:10:31	11.08 min		18.7

The above magnitudes were calculated assuming a magnitude of R=15.22
for the the USNO-B reference star located at 12:10:57.57, +39:55:40.2.

Further observations are planned.
