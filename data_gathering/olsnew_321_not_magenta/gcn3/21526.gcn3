AGILE Team:
In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger event G298048 at T0 = 2017-08-17
12:41:04.446 UTC (GCN #21505) and the Fermi-GBM trigger event 170817.529
at T1 = 12:41:06.470 UTC (GCN #21506), we performed an analysis of the
AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different  timescales. On
Fermi-GBM trigger time (T1) the GRID exposure covered nearly 10% of the
Fermi-GBM 3-sigma localization region, observed at off-axis angles between
15 and 55 deg.

Due to Earth occultation the GRID field of view did not cover the new revised
HLV G298048 90% localization region (GCN #21513).

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T1.
Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the
accessible Fermi-GBM 3-sigma localization region are reported below:

from 1.4e-06 to 2.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s
from 1.4e-07 to 6.6e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 20s
from 3.2e-08 to 8.8e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
