We observed the field of GRB 170202A (Racusin et al. GCN 20575) with the 
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) on February the 3rd,
starting at 3:16 UT (8.8 hours after the trigger), until 10:30 UT. We 
performed a series of exposures in the clear filter. The weather 
conditions were variable with a typical estimated seeing of 2".

We detected the afterglow observed by UVOT (Racusin et al., GCN 20575) 
on a combined image (spanning times from 10h to 11.92h after the 
trigger). Its magnitude, estimated by comparison to nearby USNO-B1 
stars, was R = 20.8 +/- 0.3.

Further analysis is in progress.

Magnitudes have not been corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is 
still in its commissioning phase.
