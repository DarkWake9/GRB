K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the NEAR GRB team, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the
Konus Wind GRB team, report:

The gamma-ray burst gods were very angry on Sunday June 4.  This burst
was observed by Ulysses, NEAR, and Konus at 2114 s UT.  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration ~15 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of ~1.3x10^-5
erg/cm^2, and a 0.25 s peak flux of ~3x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have
localized it to a preliminary error box whose area is ~22 sq.  arcmin.
(3 sigma) and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 15 h 35 m 47.21 s     10 o 41 '  17.56 "  (CENTER)
 15 h 35 m 42.92 s     10 o 41 '   2.17 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 36 m  4.71 s     10 o 32 '  10.77 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 35 m 29.72 s     10 o 50 '  24.70 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 35 m 51.51 s     10 o 41 '  32.95 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined considerably.
