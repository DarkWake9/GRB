I.A. Steele & C.M. Copperwheat (Liverpool JMU) report the following
observations of EM candidates associated with G211117.  All
observations were obtained using the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope,
La Palma.

Master OTJ020906 (GCN 18729) was observed with the IO:O imaging camera
in the R band with exposure time 150 seconds on 2015-12-28 at 21:00UT.  
The transient could not be distinguished by eye from the host galaxy to an 
approximate limiting magnitude of R~20 with respect to USNO objects in the image.

The reported transient in galacy UGC1410 (GCN 18742) was observed with 
the acquisition camera of the SPRAT spectrograph on 2015-12-29 at
19:48UT.  No source was visible in the 10 second white light acquisition images 
at the reported coordinates - we note the report from iPTF that this 
is likely a solar system object (GCN 18762).

LSQ15BVW (GCN 18759) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on 2015-12-29 at
23:20UT.  No source was apparent at the reported coordinates in the
10 second white light acqusition images to a limiting magnitude of R~19.5 with respect to
USNO objects in the image.

iPTF-15ffh (GCN 18762) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on
2015-12-30 at 19:04UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is
underway.

iPTF-15ffi (GCN 18762) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on
2015-12-30 at 19:43UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is 
underway.  

iPTF-15fel (GCN 18762) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on
2015-12-30 at 20:20UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is
underway.  

iPTF-15fhq (GCN 18762) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograph on
2015-12-30 at 21:22UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is
underway.

iPTF-15fev (GCN 18762) was ovserved with the SPRAT spectrograpg on
2015-12-30 at 21:55UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is
underway.

iPTF-15fhl (GCN 18762) was observed with the SPRAT spectrograoph on
2015-12-31 at 02:48UT.  A spectrum was obtained and classification is
underway.
