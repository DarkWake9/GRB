We analyzed GRB 210704A (Ursi et al., GCN 30372; Berretta et al., GCN 
30375; Prasad et al., GCN 30378; D'Ai et al., GCN 30379; Malacaria 
etal., GCN 30380; Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388) using publicly available 
data of GBM/Fermi. The burst consists of several episodes of emission 
with duration of T_90 = 4.6 s, but the emission is visible up to 20 s 
after the trigger. Energy spectrum constructed in the time interval of 
(-0.2, 6.5) seconds relative to the GBM trigger time is best described 
by Bandmodel with relatively low E_peak = 294 keV corroborating with 
E_peak reported by GBM team (Malacaria et al., GCN 30380) and Konus-Wind 
(Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388).

Based on E_peak, Fluence in 1 keV â€” 10 MeV range (2.77e-5 erg cm^-2) and 
T_90 we draw a trajectory of the burst in EH - T_90 diagram varying the 
unknown source redshift 
(http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB210704A/GRB210704A_EH-T90_GBM.png , see [1-2] for 
details). The lower 2 sigma redshift limit of the source is z=0.11, 
which excludes the association of the GRB with the field galaxy at z = 
0.0817, but leaves a possibility of association with the field cluster 
at z = 0.203 (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 30392). We also estimate 
E_iso = 8.2e50 erg at z = 0.11 and E_iso = 3.7e53 erg at z = 2.34 
(marginally suggested after GTC spectroscopy, de Ugarte Postigo et al., 
GCN 30392).
Based only on the trajectory at the EH - T_90 diagram we could suggest 
the collapsar origin (Type II) of GRB 210704A.
