P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:37:07.19 UT on July 3 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140603A (trigger 426040630/140703026),
which was also detected by 
Swift (D. Kocevski et al. 2014, GCN 16503).  
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/XRT location
and the TELMA robotic telescope 
location (R. Cunniffe et al. 2014 GCN16504).  

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight
 is 16 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one main FRED-like peak near T0 and a
late smaller peak at ~T0+70s with a duration (T90) of about
84s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4s to T0+31s 
is well fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.10 +/- 0.06
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 177 +/- 14 keV. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.4 +/- 0.4)E-07 ergs/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.7s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
