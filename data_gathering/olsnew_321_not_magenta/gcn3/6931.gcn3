The long GRB 071010B (Swift/BAT trigger #293795;
C. B. Markwardt et al., GCN 6871, 6877)
was triggered by the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2007-10-10 20:45:49 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a single FRED-like peak,
starting at T0-3s, ending  at T0+10s, with a duration (T90) of about 5 seconds.
There is no signal corresponding to the pre-trigger pulse and the weak soft tail
detected by the Swift/BAT (GCN Report 92.1) and the Konus-Wind (GCN 6879)
in the WAM energy band (50-5000 keV).

The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was (1.8 +/- 0.3)*10^-6 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+1s was 1.1 +/- 0.3 photons/cm^2/s in the same
energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-3s to
T0+10s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 3.2 (-0.5, +0.7) (chi^2/d.o.f = 6/8 ).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
