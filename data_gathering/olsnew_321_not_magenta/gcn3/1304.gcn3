A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the HETE coordinates
for GRB020317 (Ricker et al. GCN 1280) with the USNOFS
1.0-m telescope on one marginally photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=13.5 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb020317.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors are less than 100mas.

Since no evidence of an optical afterglow has been presented
through the GCN, we do not intend to revisit this field.
