report: 

"GRB 010214 (another ``Valentine's Day Burst'') was observed with 
the Narrow Field Instruments (NFI) on board BeppoSAX from Feb. 14.62 
to Feb. 16.52 UT (starting about 6 hrs after the burst trigger time;
Gandolfi, GCN #933) . In the 2-10 keV image from MECS units 2 and
3, a fading point source (1SAX J174058+4834.6) is detected within 
the WFC error circle (Gandolfi GCN #933). The source position is 
R.A. = 17h40m58s, Decl. = +48d34'37" (Eq. 2000) with 1 arcmin error 
radius. The centroid position is consistent with the preliminary
NFI analysis reported by Gandolfi (GCN #937). 

In the first 12,000 s the source had a 2-10 keV flux of about 6E-13
erg/cmE2/s, while a 2-sigma upper limit of about 5e-14 erg/cmE2/s 
was derived in the last part of the observation. We conclude that 
1SAX J174058+4834.6 is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 010214. The source
fading appears faster than usual, with a power-law index of about 1.6."
