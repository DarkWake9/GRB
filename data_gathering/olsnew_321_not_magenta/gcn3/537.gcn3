 We observed the error box of GRB000131 (GCN #529, #530) on Feb 4th and
 5th between 15-18UT using the 2.34m as well as 1.02m telescopes of
 Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur, India. The sky conditions were
 non-photometric with poor transparency and seeing (fwhm >2".5).
 
 The fading optical counterpart reported by Peredson et al ( GCN #534) is
 not detected in a single 30min V image (limiting magnitude = 21.0) taken 
 on Feb 4.68 UT with 2.34m telescape.
