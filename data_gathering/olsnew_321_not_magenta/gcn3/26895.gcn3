M. H. Siegel (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:44:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200127A (trigger=952791).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 295.204, +44.910 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 40m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 54' 35"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 14:46:52.1 UT, 140.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 295.19447,
44.90030 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 40m 46.67s
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 54' 01.1"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 42 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.17
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 9.40e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
309 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.16.
