SUBJECT: GRB 161129A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    16/11/29 12:54:44 GMT

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 2977 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 6 UVOT
images for GRB 161129A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 316.22770, +32.13488 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 21h 04m 54.65s
Dec (J2000): +32d 08' 05.6"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
