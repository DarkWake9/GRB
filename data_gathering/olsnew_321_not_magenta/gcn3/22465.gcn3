We observed the field of GRB 180305A (Axelsson, et al., GCN Circ. 22457)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/03 7.11 to
2018/03 7.20 UTC (41.30 to 43.46 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 1.64 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

The source reported by Troja et al. (GCN Circ. 22460) is still detected,
but has faded to:

 r	= 23.15 +/- 0.21
 i	= 22.80 +/- 0.15

These magnitudes are in the AB system, are calibrated against the
USNO-B1 catalog, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the
direction of the GRB.

The combination of the optical fading reported here and the X-ray fading
reported by D’Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. 22462) confirm that this is the
afterglow of the GRB.

Mártir.
