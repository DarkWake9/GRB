A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D.  Xu (DARK/NBI), P. Jakobsson (U. Iceland), J. Datson (Tuorla Obs.), R.  Salinas (FINCA), T. Augusteijn (NOT), Y. Martinez-Osorio (NOT), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 130603B (Melandri et al., GCN 14735) using the 2.5m NOT telescope beginning on 2013 Jun 3 at 21:22 UT. Observations consisted of 5x360 s in the r band. As noted by Levan et al. (GCN 14742), the refined XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 14739) straddles a galaxy detected in the SDSS, which has a photometric redshift z=0.39+/-0.11.

Our images reveal a point source superimposed over this galaxy, and consistent with the XRT posion, at the following coordinates (J2000+/-0.5"):

R.A.: 11:28:48.15
Dec.: +17:04:18.0

This source is not visible in the SDSS and it is the afterglow of GRB 130603B. We obtain a preliminary magnitude of r = 20.9 calibrated against SDSS (DR9). The afterglow is located ~0.8" SW of the host galaxy nucleus.

Our results are consistent with those of Levan et al. (GCN 14742).
