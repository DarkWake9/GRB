K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
E. Montanari, C. Guidorzi, and F. Frontera, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 53846 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  70.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.2E-05 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s over  .25 seconds


We have triangulated it to a, preliminary, 3 sigma error box with approximate area  32.
square arcminutes whose coordinates are:
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   6 h 49 m 34.54 s     36 o 22 '  52.78 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  6 h 49 m 40.68 s     36 o 21 '  37.66 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  6 h 48 m 49.32 s     36 o 19 '   4.79 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  6 h 50 m 20.11 s     36 o 26 '  42.07 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  6 h 49 m 28.41 s     36 o 24 '   7.90 " 

This error box may be improved
