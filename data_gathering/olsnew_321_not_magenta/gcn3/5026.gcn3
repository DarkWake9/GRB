MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) observed
  GRB060425 error box (GRB_TIME is 2006-04-25 16:57:40 UT, IPN triangulation 
GCN5005) in survey mode at considerable zenit distances. The weather was good.
We have two nights observations 2006-04-26 from 18:17:03.46  to 
19:53:07.00 (1.05 - 1.12 days   after the GRB time) (Lipunov et 
al.GCN5008) and  2006-04-27 from 18:57:50.89 to	19:21:19.88.
We have 72 images. The location of  our samples you can find at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB060425/GRB060425_ErrorBox_master.jpg

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).

The robot not find OT brighter then 17.0 between 1.05 -1.12 day after GRB 
time in large IPN error box (J. Cummings, S. Barthelmy et al. GCN5005).

The robot not find SN brighter then 17.5 in two nights.
The search of the SN after several days is planed.
