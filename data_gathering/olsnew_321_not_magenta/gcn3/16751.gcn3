and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:54:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140828A (trigger=610953). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 142.011, +14.590 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 09h 28m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 35' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 22:33 UT on 2014 September 29. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Melandri (andrea.melandri AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
