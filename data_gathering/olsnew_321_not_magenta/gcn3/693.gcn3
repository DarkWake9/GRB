TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  693
SUBJECT: GRB000607, A SHORT, HARD BURST
DATE:    00/06/07 21:27:51 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the Konus Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 08689 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, its duration was <150 milliseconds.  This
duration, as well as its intensity >150 keV, as observed by NEAR,
place this burst in the short-duration, hard-spectrum class.  This
is the first rapid, precise localization of such a burst, for which
no counterpart has yet been observed.  The 25-100 keV fluence was
~2x10^-7 erg/cm^2, and the 0.03125 s peak flux was ~3.5x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.
We have localized this burst to a preliminary 30 sq. arcmin. error box whose
coordinates (3 sigma) are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  2 h 33 m 58.74 s     17 o  8 '  51.49 "  (CENTER)
  2 h 34 m  6.89 s     17 o 10 '   9.17 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 33 m 35.94 s     16 o 57 '  49.88 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 34 m 21.56 s     17 o 19 '  53.67 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 33 m 50.58 s     17 o  7 '  33.82 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be refined considerably.
