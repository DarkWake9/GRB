The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1) and Virgo Observatory (V1) data around the time of the compact
binary merger (CBC) candidate S191216ap (GCN Circular 26454).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical, the updated parameter
estimation based classification of the GW signal, in order of
descending probability, is BBH (>99%), MassGap (<1%),
Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), or NSBH (<1%).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
