Thierry (CESR-UPS-CNRS) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 101011A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 436094) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 3932.8s after the GRB trigger
(3910s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
55 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good with a high level of humidity.

30 images have been maded with a duration of 180.0s each
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
At the position of the XRT afterglow (Evans et al., GCN 11333), we do
not detect any source with a limiting magnitude of g>   19.5
on the single images.

We co-added a series of exposures between t0+3932.8s to t0+9869.4s
We do not detect any afterglow, with a limiting magnitude of  g>   21.5


Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=283.3069 lat=-45.3657
