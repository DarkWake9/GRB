and H. J. van Eerten (Bath), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 190829A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 25551; Dichiara et al, GCN
25552) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array beginning at 2019 Aug 30
16:10 UT, 20.2 hours after the burst. We detect the cm-band afterglow at
the position of the mm-band counterpart (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN
25589) with a preliminary flux density of ~ 2 mJy at 5.5 GHz.

Further observations are on-going.

We thank the CSIRO staff for rapidly scheduling these observations. The
Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope
National Facility which is funded by the Australian Government for
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO."
