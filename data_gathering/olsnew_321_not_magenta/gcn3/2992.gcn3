At 04:19:54 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and 
located on-board GRB050128.  The spacecraft autonomously slewed to the 
burst and an x-ray afterglow source was detected by XRT (GCN 2991, 
Antonelli et al.).

The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 219.587, -34.762 (J2000) 
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including a systematic 
uncertainty dominated by the GRB being 51 deg off axis).  This is 39 
arcsec from the XRT position.  The lightcurve is multi-peaked with a T90 
duration of 13.8 sec.  The fluence is 4.5e-6 erg/cm^2 and the peak flux (1 
sec interval) is 4.6 ph/cm^2/s in the 15-350 keV band.  The spectrum is 
consistent with a power-law of photon index 1.5 +- 0.05.

[GCN OPS NOTE (28jan05):  As per D.Burrows request, the "C.Milvia" 
was changed to "M. Capalbi".]
