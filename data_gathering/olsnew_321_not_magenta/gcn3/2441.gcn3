D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey-HEND and GRS, and RHESSI observed
this GRB at 51061 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately 22 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
2.5E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.8E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with
approximate area 1600 square arcminutes whose coordinates are:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   4 h 26 m 54.86 s     -5 o 55 '  49.00 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  4 h 26 m 57.58 s     -5 o 53 '   3.70 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5:  4 h 23 m  0.21 s     -2 o 24 '  18.37 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6:  4 h 31 m  2.25 s     -9 o 52 '  11.05 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7:  4 h 26 m 52.15 s     -5 o 58 '  34.45 " 

Some improvement in this error box is expected, but the
data quality for some of the spacecraft is poor due to solar
activity.
