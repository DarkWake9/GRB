The long GRB 080319C (Swift-BAT trigger #306778: Pagani et al., GCN
7442, Stamatikos et al., GCN 7483)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=44757.938 s UT (12:25:57.938).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
with a total duration of ~15 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.50(-0.21, +0.34)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.256 s
of 3.35(-0.70, +0.79)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+16.640 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV-4 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.20 +/- 0.10,
and Ep = 594(-131, +224) keV (chi2 = 79.3/73 dof).
Fitting by GRBM (Band) model yields:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.01 +/- 0.13,
the high energy photon index beta = -1.87(-0.63, +0.15),
the peak energy Ep = 307(-92, +141) keV (chi2 = 76.1/72 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
