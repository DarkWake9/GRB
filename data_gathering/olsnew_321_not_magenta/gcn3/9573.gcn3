J. A. Kennea (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester), M. A. Stark (PSU) and
R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Swift executed a Target of Opportunity observation 
of the INTEGRAL GRB 090625B, slewing to the 
burst at 14:24 UT. 

XRT observations began at 14:30:13.  The observation begins too late 
after the burst for us to determine whether any sources in the field 
of view are fading.  However, we find a faint X-ray source located at
RA,Dec = 2.2618, -65.7803 which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) =  00 09 2.83
DEC (J2000.0) =  -65 46 49.2

with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). 

UVOT observations are being made, but data will not be available until
a ground downlink. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. Mao (jirong.mao AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
