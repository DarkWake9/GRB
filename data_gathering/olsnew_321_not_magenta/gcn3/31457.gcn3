The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:37:50 UT on 15 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220115B (trigger 663979075.514384 / 220115943).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 317.8, Dec = -14.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 11m, -14d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
