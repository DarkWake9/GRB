The robot optical telescope, AROMA, at Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU)
responded to GRB 060502B (Troja et al. GCN 5055).
The observations started at 17:26:26 UT (105s after the GRB) by the
0.3m optical telescope with R-band filter located at the AGU campus 
in Sagamihara, Japan.

No new source was found above the 3 sigma limiting magnitude of R~16
calibrated with USNO A2.0 by the preliminary routine analysis on the
first 20 frames of image with 5s exposure each. The mean time of the 
data set corresponded to 319s after the burst.

Further analysis is underway.
