We re-observed the field of GRB 090618 (Schady et al., GCN 9512) using the
0.9m SARA telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory beginning 20 hours
after the trigger and continuing for 3 hours.  Our observations consisted
of 45 sec exposures in the R and I bands under good conditions.  The
afterglow is detected in stacked images.  Magnitudes are given below as
compared to the USNOB.1 catalog.  Time is given in days after the trigger;
exposure time in seconds.
