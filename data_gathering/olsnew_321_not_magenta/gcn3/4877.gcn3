The Swift/UVOT began taking data on the field of GRB 060313 at 00:13:23 UT on 
2006-03-13, approximately 79s after the BAT trigger (Pagani et al., GCN 4867). 
The afterglow is detected above the 2-sigma level in the V, B and UVW2 filter 
at a position consistent with that reported by Cobb et al. (GCN 4872), and 
there is a tenuous detection in the U and UVW1 band coadded exposures at the 
1.4 and 1.2 sigma level, respectively. The detection in UVW2 implies that 
the Lyman limit must be blueward of ~2500 A, providing a redshift upper 
limit of z <~1.7.

All detections above 2-sigma and the 2-sigma upper limits from the coadded 
image of a set of exposure for each filter are as follows:

Filter	T_range(s)  Exp(s)  Average mag/UL    sigma
V       177-6963    933     20.03+/-0.39      2.9
B       469-5453    953     20.69+/-0.48      2.7
U       415-844     100     > 19.95
UVW1    361-790     100     > 18.91
UVM2    307-736     100     > 18.89
UVW2    578-900     950     20.98+/-0.5	      2.2

These magnitudes are uncorrected for Galactic extinction;
E(B-V) = 0.067.
