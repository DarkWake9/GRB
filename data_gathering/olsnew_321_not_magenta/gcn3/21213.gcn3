The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170526A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 21149) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 May 27.16, May 30.29, May 
31.33 and Jun 03.28 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Goad et al., GCN 21151), with 3sigma upper limits of 312 uJy, 
117 uJy, 96 uJy and 105 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
