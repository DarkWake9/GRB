We report the discovery of DLT17ck. The object was discovered on 
2017-08-17.99 UT at R~17.3 mag, during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) one 
day cadence supernova search, using data from the PROMPT 5 0.41m 
telescope located at CTIO. A confirmation image was obtained on 
2017-08-18.02 UT with the PROMPT telescope.  DLT17ck is located at RA: 
13:09:48.09 Dec: -23:22:53.4.6,  5.37 W, 8.60 S arcsec offset from the 
center of the host galaxy, NGC 4993,
consistent with the source found by Coulter et al. (LVC GCN 21529).
