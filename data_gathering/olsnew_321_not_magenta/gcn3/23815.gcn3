The long GRB 190129A (MAXI/GSC detection: Nakahira et al., GCN Circ. 23806;
Fermi GBM detection: Bissaldi, Mailyan & Meegan, GCN Circ. 23810)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 12:55:43.519 UTC
on 29 January 2019. The burst signal was seen by the HXM2 and SGM 
detectors.

The burst light curve shows a weak pulse which starts at T-2.2 sec and
ends at T+4.8 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data
are 6.0 +- 2.2 sec and 3.0 +- 2.2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
