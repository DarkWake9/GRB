TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1127
SUBJECT: GRB 011030 I-band Observations
DATE:    01/11/02 20:57:19 GMT
FROM:    Jules Halpern at Columbia U.  <jules@astro.columbia.edu>

J. P. Halpern, N. Mirabal (Columbia), Chris Burke, & D. L. DePoy (Ohio State),
report on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"Using the MDM 2.4m, we obtained 15 minutes of exposure in the I band centered 
at Oct. 31.21 UT, 22.5 hours after the burst.  All of the 2.1' radius refined 
BeppoSAX error circle (in 't Zand et al., GCN #1123) was covered.  A follow-up 
observation was performed on Nov. 1.22 UT, with 15 minutes of exposure.  
Conditions were not photometric, and these images have not been calibrated.  
However, no afterglow candidate has been found to a limit approximately 1 mag
fainter than the POSS-II IVN plate, or I_c > 20.5.
