IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent
with the sky
localization of gravitational-wave candidate S200213t in a time range of
1000 seconds [1]
centered on the alert event time (2020-02-13 04:02:20.328 UTC to 2020-02-13
04:19:00.328 UTC) have been performed.
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. Two
hypothesis tests
were conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood analysis which
searches for a
generic point-like neutrino source coincident with the given GW skymap [2].
The
second uses a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event
significance, which
assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical
priors in the
significance estimate, such as GW source distance [3].

1 track-like event is found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the
gravitational-wave
candidate S200213t calculated from the map circulated in the 3-Initial
notice. This
represents an overall p-value of 0.003 (2.75sigma) from the generic
transient search
and an overall p-value of 0.0174 (2.11 sigma) for the Bayesian search.
These p-values
measure the consistency of the observed track-like events with the known
atmospheric backgrounds.

The reported p-values can differ due to the estimated distance of the GW
candidate. The distance is used as a prior in Bayesian binary merger
search, while it is not
taken into account in the generic transient point-like source search.

Properties of the coincident events are shown below.

where:
dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger.
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a
circle
     representing 90% CL containment by area.
Pvalue = the pvalue for this specific track event from each search.


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the
geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of
