The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the IceCube event 190922B (2019-09-22 23:03:55, GCN 25806) 
the spacecraft was preparing to start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2140 and 2141 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2019-09-22T16:12:23 and
2019-09-23T01:40:00.
