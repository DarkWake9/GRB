report:

We have observed the optical transient of GRB050922C reported
by Rykoff et al. (GCN 4011) for 1.2h with the mean time 0.100d
after the GRB trigger (Norris et al., GCN 4013) with the 60cm
telescope at MonteBoo Observatory equipped with an ST8 CCD. We
have found the OT at roughly R=18 decaying with an index
\alpha = -0.5 .
