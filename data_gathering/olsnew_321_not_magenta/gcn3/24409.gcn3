The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving
from the direction of IceCube-190503A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/24378.gcn3) in a time
range of 2 days centered on the alert event time (2019-05-02 17:23:39 UTC to 2019-05-04 17:23:39 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the
event that prompted the alert, zero additional track-like events are found in spatial coincidence
with the 90% PSF containment of IceCube-190503A. We find that these data are well described
by atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 1.0. Accordingly, these data would
represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2
dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 3.5 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. 90% of events
IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum are between
approximately 10 TeV and 3 PeV.

A subsequent search was performed to include the previous month of data (2019-04-03 17:23:39 UTC to 2019-05-04 17:23:39 UTC). In this case, we also report a p-value of 1.0,
consistent with no significant excess of track events, and a corresponding time-integrated
muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of
6.7 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu><mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>.
