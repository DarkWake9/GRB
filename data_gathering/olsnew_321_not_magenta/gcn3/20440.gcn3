A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB),
D.N. Burrows (PSU), T.G.R. Roegiers (PSU), L.M. McCauley (PSU), S.L.
Gibson (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U.
Leicester)  reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 5.7 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode XRT data for the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 170112A, collected between T0+73 s and
T0+13.3 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 296
arcsec of the Swift/BAT position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field
ranges from ~0.002 to ~0.003 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV
observed flux of 7.8e-14 to 1.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical
GRB spectrum).

Six uncatalogued sources were detected too far from the GRB position to
be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00732188.
