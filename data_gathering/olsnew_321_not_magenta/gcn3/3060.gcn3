report:

Quick-Look-Analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of the GRB050223
field based on a 5ks exposure in the EPIC pn camera that started at
13:57 UT, shows the
presence of a source within the SWIFT/XRT error circle (Giommi et al.,
GCN 3054).

XMMU J180532.5-622821 (J2000):
R.A. = 18h 05m 32.5s  Decl. = -62deg 28' 21''
with an estimated EPIC/pn count rate of 0.03 counts/sec;

At this stage of data reduction the position error is expected to be
less than 5''.
