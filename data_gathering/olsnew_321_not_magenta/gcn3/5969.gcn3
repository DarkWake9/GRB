M. Uemura, A. Arai, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.), 
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We perfomed optical imaging of the field of GRB061222A (GCN 5954, 5964, 
5966) at 9:43-10:05 UT 22 Dec. using the TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 
1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan.  
We obtained 7 R-band images with a 123-s exposure time.  The images were
calibrated with neighbor stars in the USNO A2.0 catalog (r mag.). 

No new object was found within the XRT error circle.  
The limit magnitude is estimated to be 21.6 (3-sigma).
