The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:46:04 UT on 8 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220408A (trigger 671089569.40531 / 220408240).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 192.9, Dec = 49.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 51m, 49d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 52.0 degrees.
