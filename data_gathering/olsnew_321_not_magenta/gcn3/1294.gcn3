GRB 020322: Optical candidate

J. S. Bloom (Caltech), N. Mirabal & J. P. Halpern (Columbia), D. W. Fox,
and P. A. A. Lopes (Caltech), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Palomar R-band images referred to in GCN #1292 show a faint object
consistent with the X-ray afterglow position and uncertainty reported
from XMM (Ehle et al., GCN #1293).  At 10:39 UT, 7.9 hours after the
burst, an object is present at

	(J2000) 18:01:02.9, +81:06:28.1

Compared to a USNO star at 18:00:58.03, +81:06:08.3 listed as having
R=17.5 mag, the candidate optical transient has R = 23.26 +/- 0.32 mag."
