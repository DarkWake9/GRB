SUBJECT: GRB 161023A: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, 
S.Fotopoulou(ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of 
the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 45 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 22:38:40 UT of 2016 October 23.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  311.0342 deg
DEC.=  -47.6614  deg

with an uncertainty of  1   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux greater than 5 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range greater than 5e-6 
erg/cmq. These are lower limits because this bright burst caused ISGRI 
telemetry saturation.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
