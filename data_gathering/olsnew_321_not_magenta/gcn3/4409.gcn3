(CfA) report:

"We obtained 2x1500 sec spectra of the object found inside, S1 (GCN 4404,
4407, 4408), and the galaxy north-east, G1 (GCN 4408), of the XRT error
box of GRB 051227 (GCN 4402) with Keck II (+ DEIMOS).  We detect
absorption lines at the position of the galaxy which we identify as Ca II
H&K at z = 0.714.  We also detect emission lines which we identify as
[O II] 3727 and H beta.

If the GRB afterglow is S1 and at this redshift, then the offset from G1
to S1 would amount to 33.7 kpc in projection."
