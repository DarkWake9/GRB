Following the detection of fast radio bursts (ATel #13681 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13681>, #13682 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13682>,  #13684 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13684>) accompanied with X-ray flares (GCN Circular #27657 <http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/27657.gcn3>, #27659 <http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/27659.gcn3>, #27661 <http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/27661.gcn3>; ATel #13675 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13675>, #13678 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13678>, #13679 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13679>,  #13685 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13685>, #13686 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13686>, #13687 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13687>, #13688 <http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13688>), we have performed a search, using ANTARES data, for up-going muon neutrino candidates from the direction of  SGR 1935+2154 in a time window of +/- 1h around the time of the X-ray trigger (14:34:24 UTC). At this time, the source was located 19 degrees below the horizon for ANTARES, and remained visible over the whole  +/- 1h time window.  

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded at the location of the source.
This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 14 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 5.6 TeV â€“ 5.4 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 30 GeV.cm^-2 (1 TeV - 515 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum.

A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (38% visibility).

ANTARES <http://antares.in2p3.fr/> is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
