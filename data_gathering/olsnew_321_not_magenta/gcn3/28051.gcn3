Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200630A (trigger #980210)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 28043).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 91.389, -60.779 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 05m 33.3s
   Dec(J2000) = -60d 46' 44.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 70%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0, and ends at~T+17 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 14.83 +- 3.63 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.51 to T+16.64 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.64 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.7 +- 0.7 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
