K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

The Konus ecliptic latitude response limits the IPN annulus for this
burst  (RA, Decl(2000)=0.654, -35.254 degrees, radius 81.705 +/-  0.108
degrees 3 sigma, GCN 1680) to that portion north of ecliptic latitude
+30 degrees, that is, that part of the annulus which lies north of RA,
Dec= 25.8, +43.0 degrees and 286.6, +7.7 degrees.
