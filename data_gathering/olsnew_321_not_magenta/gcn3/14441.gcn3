We again observed the field of GRB 130420A (Page et al., GCN Circular
14406) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 24.26 to
2013/04 24.46 UTC (94.73 to 99.64 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 2.84 hours exposure in the r' and i' bands and 1.19
hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with SDSS
DR8 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma) in the AB
magnitude system:

r'	> 23.15
i'	> 23.02
Z	> 21.75
Y	> 21.44
J	> 21.72
H	> 21.16

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the
direction of the GRB.

In comparison with our earlier observations (Watson et al., GCN Circular
14409; Butler et al., GCN Circular 14431; Watson et al., GCN Circular
14439), the source has faded by about at least a magnitude in r' and i'
between about 50 and about 97 hours.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
