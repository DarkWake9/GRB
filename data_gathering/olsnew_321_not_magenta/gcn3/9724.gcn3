Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090727 (trigger #358520)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 9718).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 315.917, 64.937 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 03m 40.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +64d 56' 12.7" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 83%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows an initial FRED-like peak starting at
~T-5 sec, peaking at ~T_zero, and ending at ~T+20 sec.  The second, weaker,
peak starts at ~T+130 to ~T+150 sec.  The third peak starts at ~T+180 sec,
peaks at ~T+270 sec, and ends at ~T+320 sec.  This third peak corresponds
to the flare mentioned in Circ 9723 (Evans).  T90 (15-350 keV) is 302 +- 23 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.3 to T+318.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.24 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.12 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
