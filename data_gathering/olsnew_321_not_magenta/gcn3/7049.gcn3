P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the INTEGRAL error circle of the INTEGRAL burst GRB 071109
(GCN 7046) using the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz.
The observations were taken at 0.0 UT on 2007, November 10th, 3.4 hours
after the burst. We detect radio afterglow of GRB 071109 within the
INTEGRAL error circle. The flux density in 23 min long observation is
188+/-42 uJy at the
following position:
RA(J2000)   19 19 51.67
Dec(J2000) +02 01 49.88
