We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004
(Fox et al. GCN 1564) with the 1.8m Vatican Advanced
Technology Telescope beginning 2002 Oct 26.25 (UT).
Seven, 10 minute exposures in the R band were combined
and an unresolved source was detected within 0.2"
of the afterglow position. Assuming the star at
00:26:51.44 18:54:36.3 (2000) has a magnitude of
R=17.142 (Henden GCN 1630) we find the afterglow
brightness to be R=23.39+/-0.12. Combining the
Williams, Lindsay, & Milne (GCN 1652) observation with
the VATT image provides a power-law decay index of -1.7
between one and three weeks after the burst. This is
significantly steeper than the "average" decay index
between 0.4 and 3 days after the burst (Holland et al.
GCN 1597) and may indicate a final break in the light
curve. Although, the odd variability of GRB 021004 makes 
this conclusion uncertain.
