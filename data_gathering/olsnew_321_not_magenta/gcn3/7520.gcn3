C. Clemens, A. Kupcu Yoldas, J. Greiner, A. Yoldas, T. Kruehler and G. Szokoly 
(Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest and MPE Garching) (all others MPE Garching) report 
on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080325 (Swift trigger 307604; L. Vetere et al., 
GCN #7512) simultaneously in g', r', i', z', J, H and K with GROND (Greiner 
et al. 2008, PASP) mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla 
Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 09:50 UT on March 25th, 2008, about 5.7 hrs after the 
GRB trigger. We obtained 20 mins of total integration time in J, H and K 
during morning twilight.

We do not detect any new source within the 2.6'' enhanced Swift-XRT error 
circle reported by J. Osborne et al. (GCN #7513) to the following 3-sigma 
upper limits:

J > 20.4, H > 19.4 and K > 19.0.

We also detect the afterglow candidate, about 6" south of the centre of the 
enhanced Swift-XRT error circle, reported by A. Updike et al. (GCN #7515) to 
following magnitude:

J = 18.60 +/- 0.06,

calibrated against 2MASS catalogue stars.
