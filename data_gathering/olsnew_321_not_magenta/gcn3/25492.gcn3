We report upper-limits from our CFHT non-detections of the
optical counterpart to AT2019osy, including deep g-band
imaging within a few hours of the DECam detection.

AT2019osy was originally reported as a rising radio source in ASKAP
observations (GCN 25487), lying within the 95% localization volume
of LIGO/Virgo S190814bv (GCN 25333). An optical counterpart was
subsequently reported in DECam observations at MJD 5816.26
(GCN 25488), with a preliminary magnitude of i=22.3.

Previously, we used the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument on CFHT to
tile the localization region of LIGO/Virgo S190814bv. Our imaging
covered AT2019osy multiple times, including deep g-band observations
within hours of the DECam observations that discovered the optical
counterpart with i=22.3 mag on MJD 58716. We do not detect
AT2019osy in our images, and report the following upper limits:

MJD, days post-merger, band, mag
58711.5,   1.7 days,   g,   >21.85
58713.5,   3.6 days,   i,   >22.50
58716.5,   6.6 days,   g,   >23.50

We thank the CFHT queued service observing team and the telescope
staff for their help in obtaining these observations.
