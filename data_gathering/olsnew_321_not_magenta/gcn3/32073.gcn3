The short-duration GRB 220519A
(IPN triangulation: Kozyrev at al., GCN Circ. 32072)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=42339.403 s UT (11:45:39.403).

The burst light curve shows a single emission pulse,
which starts at T0-0.1 s and has a total duration of ~0.7 s.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220519_T42339/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.66(-0.02,+0.48)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.048 s,
of 6.05(-3.24,+3.66)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the main fraction of the burst emission was detected
before the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modelling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(measured from T0-0.096 s to T0+0.640 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep),
yields alpha = -0.13(-0.35,+0.44) and Ep = 507(-77,+117) keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 68% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
