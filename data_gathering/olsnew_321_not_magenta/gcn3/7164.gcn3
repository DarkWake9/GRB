A.K.H. Kong (NTHU), A. Soderberg, E. Berger (Princeton), N. Rea 
(Amsterdam), T. Maccarone (Southampton) report:

Swift performed an observation of the X-ray transient in NGC 2770 on 
2008 Jan
11 02:45UT. No X-ray source was detected in the 1.1ks observation. However,
the optical transient was clearly detected in the U, V, and B bands of the
UVOT. The source was marginally seen in the UVW1 image. The very rough B 
and V
magnitude is 18.8 and 18.4, respectively. The Swift observations 
indicate that
the optical transient becomes brighter in the past 24 hours. We note 
that the
optical transient was not seen in the UVOT observations taken on 2008 Jan 9
(ATel #1353,1355).
