SUBJECT: GRB 060219: Swift-XRT position typo correction
DATE:    06/02/20 03:44:56 GMT
FROM:    Alberto Moretti at Obs Brera Merate  <moretti@merate.mi.astro.it>

A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), report on behalf of the Swift XRT
team:
                                                                                
The XRT position of the afterglow of GRB 060219 reported in 
Moretti et al. (GCN 4791) has a typo; the correct position is

RA(J2000) = 16h 07m 21.08s
Dec(J2000) = 32d 18m 55.9s
                                                                                
We estimate an uncertainty of 6.7 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This position is 1.74 arcminutes from the BAT position given in GCN
4788.
