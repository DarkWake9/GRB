TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3102
SUBJECT: GRB050315: Radio afterglow
DATE:    05/03/16 18:04:36 GMT
FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report
on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed the
field of GRB050315 (GCN 3094) on 2005 Mar 16.68 UT (t=0.80 d).
Within the XRT localization (GCN 3097), we detect a radio
source at the following coordinates:

          RA: 20:25:54.17   Dec: -42:36:01.0 (J2000)

with a positional uncertainty of ~0.5 arcsec.  Noting that
this source is roughly coincident with the optical afterglow position
reported by Kelson and Berger (GCN 3100), we interpret this as the radio
afterglow of GRB050315.

Further observations are planned."
