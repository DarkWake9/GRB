A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 22:20:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 211024B (trigger=1081073).  Swift slewed immediately to
the burst, but immediately slewed away due to a conflicting observation. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 154.688, +24.579 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 18m 45s
   Dec(J2000) = +24d 34' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 70 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~7 sec after the trigger. 

Because of a conflicting preplanned observation, there was
no immediate XRT or UVOT observation.  A target of opportunity
observation is planned. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J.D. Gropp (jdg44 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
