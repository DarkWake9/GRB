TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2305
SUBJECT: GRB030329: Subaru Optical Spectroscopy

G. Kosugi, Y. Mizumoto, Y. Ohyama, K. S. Kawabata, and K. Aoki
(Subaru Telescope, NAOJ), report:

Spectra of GRB 030329 (H2656, Vanderspek et al, GCN 1997) optical
transient (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985) were obtained using the
Subaru 8.2m telescope and FOCAS (Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph)
with the wavelength coverage of 4700 to 9400A (R=700) on June 22.3 UT
(85 days after the burst).

Compared with the previous data (May 8 and 9 UT : 40 days after the
burst, Kawabata et al. IAUC 8133), we found that several nebular
phase lines ([OI] 6300/6364, [CaII] 7291/7323, etc.) began to emerge
out of the photospheric phase supernova spectrum.
