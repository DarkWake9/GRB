V. Rumyantsev (CrAO),   A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB
follow-up collaboration:

We observed the error box of short GRB071008  (Moretti  et al., GCN 6856)
with Shajn 2.6m telescope of CrAO on Oct. 9.  Series of images were obtained
between (UT)   00:15:12 and  01:30:43 in R filter. The limiting magnitude (3
sigma) of a combined image calibrated against USNO-A2.0  is 24.3 mag. The
combined image of a total exposure of 4020 s (67x60 s) covers entire of the
refined BAT error box (Fenimore  et al., GCN 6869).

Within error circles of the two XRT sources (Moretti  et al., GCN 6866) we
found following optical objects.
Within XRT source at RA(J2000) = 10 06 21.24  Dec(J2000)= +44 19 14.5 there
is a galaxy S1 which also can be detected in SDSS images. However the galaxy
S1 is out of the refined BAT error box (Fenimore  et al., GCN 6869).
Within XRT source at RA(J2000) = 10 06 12.82  Dec(J2000)= +44 20 40.5 we
marginally detect S2 object.
It is necessary a second epoch observation to decide about nature of the S2
object.

The combined image can be found at http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB071008.
