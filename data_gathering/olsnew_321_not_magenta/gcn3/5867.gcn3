As observed by RHESSI, GRB061126 (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 5854; Krimm
et al., GCN 5860) had a duration of ~25s starting at about T0=8:47:54 UT.
A fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum of the main period of emission
from T0+6s - T0+13s between 30 keV and 10 MeV gives a cutoff power law, with

alpha = -0.95 +0.29/-0.23
E0 = 890. +740/-370. keV
Epeak = 935. +/-360. keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 30 keV-2 MeV fluence is ~2 E-5 erg/cm^2.

This fit is preliminary and may be improved with ongoing analysis.
