Beardmore (U. Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of GRB 220403C, detected
outside the BAT coded FOV by GUANO NITRATES (Aaron Tohuvavohu et al.
GCN Circ. 31824), as well as by Fermi-GBM, INTEGRAL, CALET and
ISS-ASIM, collecting 3.2 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+497.7 ks and T0+528.5 ks. 

Six uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of them
is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading. Therefore,
at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the afterglow.
Details of these sources are given below:
