E. Berger and A. Rest (Harvard) report:

"We observed the position of GRB 081204 (GCN 8614) with the LDSS3
instrument on the Magellan/Clay telescope.  A total of 30 sec were
obtained in r- and i-band on 2008 Dec 5.067 UT (8.86 hour after the
burst).  Within the XRT error circle (GCN 8620) we detect a single faint
source with r=23.5+/-0.3 mag and i=23.0+/-0.2 mag located at:
	RA  = 23:19:09.41
	DEC = -60:13:31.4  (J2000)
with an uncertainty of about 0.3" in each coordinate (astrometry relative
to USNO-B).  At the moment we have no information on whether the source is
variable."
