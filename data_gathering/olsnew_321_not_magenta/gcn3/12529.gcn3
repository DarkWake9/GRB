At 10:35:13.39 UT on 03 November 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and observed GRB 111103A (trigger 342009315/111103441),
which was detected by the Swift/BAT (Stroh et al. 2011, GCN 12518).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of 11.78 +/- 1.18 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+13.7 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.43 (+0.16/-0.15) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 152.2 (+16.1/-12.8) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.20 +/- 0.19)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.13 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 5.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
