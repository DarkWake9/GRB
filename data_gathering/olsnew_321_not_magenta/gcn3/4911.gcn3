S. Covino (INAF/OABr), D. Malesani (SISSA), L.A. Antonelli (INAF/OAR), 
D. Fugazza (INAF/OABr), V. Lorenzi, G. Tessicini (INAF/TNG), report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 060323 (Vetere et al., GCN 4904) with the 
Italian 3.6m TNG telescope.

Observations were acquired in the V and R filters (10 min exposure). The 
mean time of the R-band exposure was Mar 23.9738 UT (8.8 hr after the 
GRB). We clearly detect the object reported by Kann & Stecklum (GCN 4909). 
Its magnitude, using as a reference the star quoted in GCN 4909 (R=18.65), 
is R=22.6. Thus, the object seems to have faded.

We note however that this candidate lies 9.6" off the center of the XRT 
error box (Kennea et al., GCN 4908), which has a quoted error radius of 
3.9".

We retrieved the g-, r-, and i-band frames from the publicly available 
SDSS survey (Cool et al., GCN 4905). Coadding the three frames, the 
afterglow candidate is clearly visible, thus casting some doubt on its 
nature.

Inspection of the XRT error circle, moreover, reveals a faint, pointlike 
source at the coordinates (J2000):

   alpha = 11:37:45.25
   delta = +49:59:07.3

Its magnitude is R~23.1 (referenced to the same comparison star). It is 
also barely visible in the V-band images. We thus consider also this 
object as a plausible afterglow candidate. Further observations are 
encouraged.

We thank the TNG staff for their valuable support.
