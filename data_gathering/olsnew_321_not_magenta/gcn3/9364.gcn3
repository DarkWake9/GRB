Using the data sets from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090515 (trigger #352108)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 9356).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 164.166, 14.469 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 56m 39.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 28' 09.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with a slightly longer
fall time than rise time. The total width is about 0.075 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.036 +- 0.016 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.008 to T+0.056 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.6 +- 0.2.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.1 +- 0.4 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T-0.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 0.9 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
