B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) report on behalf of the Swift team

A second epoch of observations on the ground discovered GRB 150204A (Cummings, GCN 17404) was performed by Swift from T+378.9 ks to T+391.6 ks, with a 3.9 ks exposure.

The source reported by Melandri et al. (GCN 17409) has faded below detection, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.5E-3 counts/s (6.2e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1).  We therefore confirm that this is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 150204A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
