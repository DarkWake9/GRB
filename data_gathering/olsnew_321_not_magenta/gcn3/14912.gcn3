David Gruber (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:52:30.48 UT on 17 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered on a burst from SGR J1550-5418 / AXP 1E1547.0-5408 
(trigger 393155553 / 130617411) which was also detected by the Swift satellite
(Holland et al. 2013, GCN 14911).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.2 s (8-200 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.24 s to T0-0.032 s is
best fit by a blackbody function with a kT = 12.9 +/- 0.6 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.3 +/- 0.1)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 16 ms peak photon flux 
 measured at T0-0.208 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 19.8 +/- 2.6 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary."
