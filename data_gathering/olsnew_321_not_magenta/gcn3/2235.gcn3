At 14:04:53.56 UTC (50693.56 UT) on 3 May 2003, the HETE FREGATE and
WXM instruments detected event H2716, a long, bright GRB.

The burst triggered FREGATE in the 30-400 keV energy band.  The WXM
flight software detected the GRB and calculated a location, which was
reported in a GCN Notice at 14:05:30 UT.  However, the direction of the
burst source was such that it illuminated only the Y-detector.
Consequently, the WXM flight localization was incorrect.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a localization that was
reported in a GCN Notice at 15:44:46 UT, 100 minutes after the burst.
The WXM ground localization SNR was 12.  The localization can be
expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle which is 24 arcminutes in width
and 4.5 degrees in length.  The coordinates of the center of the
rectangle are

WXM-Ground:  R.A. = +15h 59m 02s, Dec. = -33d 29' 18" (J2000),

and the corners of the rectangle lie at:

R.A. = 16h 09m 54s, Dec. = -33d 16' 26",
R.A. = 16h 09m 41s, Dec. = -33d 33' 40",
R.A. = 15h 48m 24s, Dec. = -33d 24' 25",
R.A. = 15h 48m 08s, Dec. = -33d 42' 43" (J2000).

The width of the rectangle corresponds to the localization of the burst
in the Y-camera, and the length of the rectangle corresponds to the
the constraints on the X location of the burst deduced from the
illumination pattern on the wires of the Y-detector.

The T_90 duration of the burst in the 30-400 keV band was > 10 s.
