on the behalf of the GROAR Team, report:

We have imaged the GRB021004 OT (GCN 1565) from the
Campo Imperatore Observatory both with the 1.1 meters
AZT-24 telescope at NIR wavelengths and with the
60cm Schmidt telescope at optical wavelengths .
The last I band point has been obtained using the
AZT-8 telescope from the Crimea Observatory.

Observations on both Campo Imperatore and Crimea
Observatory have been triggered by the FAMe
facility at http://grb.mporzio.astro.it/.

The Campo Imperatore observations started on
2002-10-05 19:50:00 UT and ended on
2002-10-06 04:20:00 UT, respectively 32.1 and 39.7
hours after the burst.

We obtained two run using V, R, I, J and K filters.

Run #1:
2002-10-05.840498 V-band: OT ~ 20.06 +- 0.06
2002-10-05.865937 R-band: OT ~ 19.52 +- 0.05
2002-10-05.884722 I-band: OT ~ 19.1  +- 0.1
2002-10-05.863102 J-band: OT ~ 18.4  +- 0.1
2002-10-05.909583 K-band: OT ~ 16.4  +- 0.1

Run #2:
2002-10-06.062256 V-band: OT ~ 20.78 +- 0.10
2002-10-06.083842 R-band: OT ~ 19.89 +- 0.07
2002-10-06.116319 J-band: OT ~ 18.5  +- 0.1
2002-10-06.159548 K-band: OT ~ 17.1  +- 0.3

The Crimea I point has been obtained on:
2002-10-06.965972 I-band: OT ~ 19.3  +- 0.1

The color indexes at Run#1 are:
  V-J ~ 1.7 +- 0.2
  V-K ~ 3.7 +- 0.2

The magnitudes calibration is obtained from
A. Henden GCN 1583 for the optical points and from
2MASS catalog for the infrared points.

The refined analysis is underway.
