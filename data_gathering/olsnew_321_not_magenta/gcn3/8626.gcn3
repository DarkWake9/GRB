M. Andreev, A. Sergeev, (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy), Ju. 
Babina (CrAO) A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up 
collaboration report:

We are continuing observation  (Andreev et al, GCN 8608) of  the GRB081203B 
(Copeteet et al, GCN 8600) with the Z-600  telescope of Mt. Terskol 
observatory.  A set of  R-band exposures was taken between Dec.05  (UT) 
02:33-03:19. In a combined image of 30x90 s   at mid time Dec. 05 (UT) 02:56 
we still detect afterglow of the GRB081203B (Schady et al, GCN 8606). A 
photometry of the afterglow   is 20.9 +/- 0.3. The photometry is based on 
USNO-A2.0   star 1275_08617401   (RA 15 15 10.21 Dec:  +44 26 01.4) assuming 
R=17.1.
