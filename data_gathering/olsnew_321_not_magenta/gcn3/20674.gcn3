B. E. Cobb (GWU) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 170208B
(GCN 20632, Siegel et al.) with a mid-exposure time of about
5.1 hours post-burst (2017-02-09 03:38 UT). Total summed exposure
times amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

No source is detected at the position of the X-ray afterglow
(GCN 20635, Goad et al.) to approximate limiting magnitudes
of I > 20.9 and J > 19.4. Magnitudes are calibrated using
Landolt standard stars in I and 2MASS stars in J.
