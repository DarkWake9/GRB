Nysewander report:

Skynet observed the Swift/BAT localization of GRB 091029 (Grupe et al., GCN 
10097) with three of the 16" PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 46 seconds 
after the trigger in BRI through variable winds.

We detect the afterglow (Grupe et al., GCN 10097) in all filters.

The afterglow peaked in brightness approximately 5 - 6 minutes after the 
trigger, after which it has been fading with a power-law index of about 
-0.5.
