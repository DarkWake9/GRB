A. Volnova (IKI),  A. Pozanenko (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), E. Mazaeva 
(IKI), I. Korobtsev (ISTP)  report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 160912A (Cannizzo et al.
GCN 19912) with  AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) 
starting on Sep., 12 (UT) 18:14:25. We obtained several images in 
R-filter. We  clearly detected optical afterglow (Tanvir et al., GCN 
1991). Coordinates of the afterglow are (J2000)   20 05 59.64
+57 33 55.2 with uncertainty of 0.4 arcsec in both coordinates. The 
afterglow is 5 arcsec from nearby star (USNO-B1.0 1475-0371357 (J2000) 
RA = 20:06:00.32 Dec = +57:33:57.0 R2 = 18.21) and within enhanced XRT 
position (Beardmore et al. GCN 19915). Preliminary photometry  of the 
afterglow is following
