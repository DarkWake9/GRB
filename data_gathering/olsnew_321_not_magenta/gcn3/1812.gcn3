DATE:    03/01/15 15:05:18 GMT
FROM:    INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>

The ISDC Shift Team and the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB Team report:

A new procedure for the distribution of INTEGRAL SPI-ACS triggers has been decided
during the INTEGRAL-IBAS meeting on Jan, 14 2003:

The automatic alert generation is foreseen to start in the next weeks .

Until then:

- no trigger information will be distributed via the GCN circulars;

- the lightcurves and the spacecraft ephemeris data for all SPI-ACS triggers are
available at the public ftp area of the ISDC:

> ftp://isdcarc.unige.ch/arc/FTP/ibas/spiacs

- a summary list of SPI-ACS triggers summarizing only those triggers with (probable)
burst origin can be found at:

    http://www.mpe.mpg.de/gamma/instruments/integral/spi/acs/grb/tab.html


A new GCN circular will inform about the procedure after switch on of the automatic
alert generation.
