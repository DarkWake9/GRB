(INAF-OAS) report:

We are continuing observations of ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva discovered by 
ZTF (Ho et al., GCN 31619) with AZT-33IK telescope of Mondy observatory, 
AS-32 telescope of Abastumani observatory, and Zeiss-1000  telescope of 
SAO RAS between 2022-02-24 and 2022-03-09. ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva was 
observed in optic (Kim  et al., GCN 31628; Hu et al., GCN 31639; Belkin 
et al., GCNs 31643, 31683) and in X-ray by NICER (Pasham et al., GCN 
31635) and XRT/Swift (Beardmore et al., GCN 31644). 
ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva is considered an afterglow of GRB 220219B (Ho et 
al., GCN 31619; Svinkin et al., GCN 31624; Tsvetkova et al., GCN 31646; 
Belkin et al., GCN 31683).

We clearly detect  the SDSS galaxy at z=0.293 (Fremling et al., GCN 
31629). Due to non-optimal seeing we could not  discriminate the 
afterglow from the galaxy. We use aperture  photometry of a source 
(afterglow + host  galaxy). Based on our  preliminary photometry we plot 
  a light curve  of the source, see an upper panel of the Figure in

To estimate power law index of the afterglow we fit our photometric data 
by a single power law + constant host galaxy flux between start of our 
observations and up to 13.4 days after GRB 220219B trigger. The host 
galaxy fit is R = 19.68+/-0.05 and PL index alpha = -1.75+/-0.4 (Belkin 
et al., GCN 31683). The light curve of the afterglow after subtraction 
of a flux of the host is presented at the bottom panel of the Figure in

http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB220219B/GRB220219B_AT2022cva_LC.png

Starting on ~15.5 days the light curve is rising above  afterglow 
approximation by the single power law and we consider it as a possible 
evidence of rising supernova.

We urge further spectroscopic and multicolour observations to confirm 
for SN associated with GRB 220219B.
