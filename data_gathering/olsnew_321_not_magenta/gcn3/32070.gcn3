CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 
2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed detection of a long GRB 220514A, which was 
also reported by Fermi GBM ( GCN 32028), INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., 
GCN 32041) and BALROG ( Biltzinger et al. GCN 32029).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The 
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 
2022-05-14 at 12:24:58.50 UT. The measured peak count rate associated 
with the burst is 346 (+51, -30) counts/s above the background in the 
combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 4001 (+588, -793) 
counts. The local mean background count rate was 561 (+2, -3) counts/s. 
Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 54 (+9, -5) s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector 
in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2022-05-14 at 
12:24:57.99 UT. The measured peak count rate is 401 (+75, -80) counts/s 
above the background in the combined Veto data of four quadrants, with a 
total of 2095 (+596, -592) counts. The local mean background count rate 
was 1935 (+3, -4) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 29 (+4, -8) s from the 
cumulative Veto light curve.

This is the 500th GRB detected by AstroSat CZTI since its launch in 
September 2015, with an average rate of 75 GRBs/year.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at 
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led 
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC, 
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and 
facilitated the project.
