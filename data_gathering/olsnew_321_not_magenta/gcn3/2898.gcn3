At 14:06:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB041223.  The spacecraft did not autonomously slew
to the burst since automated slewing was not yet enabled.

The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec 100.183,-37.066 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 7 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including systematic
uncertainty using a preliminary bore-sight alignment calibration).
This is 27 degrees off the BAT bore sight and was in the partially encoded
field of view.

The burst lightcurve is multi-peaked with structure within the peaks
with the main emission lasting ~60 sec.  The peak flux was 7.5 events/cm^2/sec
(1-sec sampling; unsaturated; ~15 to 100 keV; ~28 Crab).
The total duration was ~130 sec.  The fluence was ~2e-5erg/cm^2.
A reduced energy band is being quoted because of our response uncertainty
in the >100 keV band, and because of strong emission by this burst 
in this band.
