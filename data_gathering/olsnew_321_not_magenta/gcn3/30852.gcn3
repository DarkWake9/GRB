D. A. Perley (LJMU), Z. P. Zhu (NAOC, HUST), D. Xu, S.Y. Fu (NAOC), D. 
B. Malesani (DTU Space), and A. Avramova-Boncheva (NOT) report:

We observed the field of GRB210919A (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 30846) using 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. We 
obtained 3x300s frames in the Sloan r-band filter and 5x240s in the 
i-band filter.  Observations were carried out on 2021-09-19 between 
03:29 and 04:08 UT.

No source is detected inside the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., 
GCN 30850), to 3-sigma limits of: r>23.4 mag (at t=3.15 hours 
post-trigger) and i>23.9 (at t=3.47 hours post-trigger).
