K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 56870 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  30 seconds, 
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux 
of approximately  5.0E-01 erg/cm2 s over 0.5 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA, Decl(2000)=
181.922, 37.602 degrees, whose radius is 78.343 +/- .036 degrees (3 sigma ).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction 
to a band between ecliptic latitudes 55 and 75 degrees, that is, to those 
portions of the annulus north of RA, Decl= 283, +32 degrees, and 2, +64 
degrees.

This annulus can be improved, but as the event was not observed by 
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
