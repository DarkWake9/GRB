   We made infrared photometry at Mt. Abu 1.2 m Cassegrain telescope using
NICMOS camera on the Transient XRF 080109/SN 2008D in NGC 2770 (Berger &
Soderberg, GCN 7159; Modjaz et al., GCN 7175 and Antonelli et al., GCN
7177) during 2008 Jan 11, Jan 13 and Jan 15. Sky conditions were good
during the first two nights but not so much on the third. The calibration
was made on the two bright stars in the field of view against 2MASS values
for 08-01-11 and using the photometric standard AS 20-0 for the other
nights.  The filters used (and overall integration times), magnitudes with
errors are given below for each date (UT).

  Date (UT)         Filter         Magnitude
2008-01-11.892    J (360 sec)     16.71+/-0.12
2008-01-13.894    J (360 sec)     16.57+/-0.10
2008-01-13.979    H (360 sec)     15.87+/-0.10
2008-01-15.864    J (480 sec)     16.12+/-0.20
2008-01-15.092    H (480 sec)     16.02+/-0.22

These magnitudes are consistent with GCN 7175 and GCN 7177. We continue to
monitor this source in the JH bands.
