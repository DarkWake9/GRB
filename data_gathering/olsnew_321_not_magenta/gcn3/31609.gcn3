The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:21:34 UT on 19 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220219A (trigger 666962499.096148 / 220219473).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 41.6, Dec = 9.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 46m, 9d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79.0 degrees.
