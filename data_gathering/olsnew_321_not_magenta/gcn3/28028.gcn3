The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:45:49 UT on 25 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200625A (trigger 614781954.14304 / 200625532).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 169.9, Dec = -22.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 19m, -22d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 104.0 degrees.
