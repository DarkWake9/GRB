The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:55:22 UT on 19 Dec 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211219A (trigger 661618527.567338 / 211219622).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 60.5, Dec = -30.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 01m, -30d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100.0 degrees.
