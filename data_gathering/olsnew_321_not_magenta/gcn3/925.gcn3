GRB010126 Optical Observations
------------------------------

"Using the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (+ALFOSC), La Palma, we have 
obtained a total of eight images which cover the error box (Hurley, GCN 922) 
by means of four consecutive pointings: 

UT                    Filter    Exp.time         Seeing
===========================================================
2001 January 27.21    R         (4 x ) 180 s     0.85" FWHM 
2001 January 28.13    R         (4 x ) 180 s     0.90" FWHM 

Intercomparison of the images has revealed no candidate counterpart 
to magnitude ~22.5 .

The object reported by Bartolini et al. (GCN 924) is detected on two 
overlapping exposures, i.e. 360 s, at each epoch. Using the nearby USNO 
star U1350_08031605 as reference, we find R = 21.17 +/- 0.20 (epoch 1) and 
R = 21.29 +/- 0.20 (epoch 2), i.e. consistent with no variability."
