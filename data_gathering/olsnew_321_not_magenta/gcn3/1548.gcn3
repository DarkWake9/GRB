E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams, report:

A preliminary analysis of the Konus data for this event (GCN 1546)
indicates that it originated from an ecliptic latitude between +20 and
+40 degrees.  Combining this information with the triangulated position
(an annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)=171.715, 38.791 degrees, whose
3 sigma radius is 88.681 +/-0.030 degrees) limits the possible arrival
directions to the two sections of the annulus contained between RA,
Decl (2000)= 14.4, 50.3 and 45.4, 38.0 degrees, and between RA, Decl
(2000)= 257.7, -2.9 and 273.8, 16.6 degrees.
