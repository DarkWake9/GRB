K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 86375 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   10.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  7.3E-06 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  2.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over  0.25 seconds
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
whose approximate area is  26. sq. arcmin. and whose
coordinates are:
     RA(2000)                                DEC(2000)
