We have extended the ASM position determination of the SGR detected on
1997 Sept 12 by the ASM, BATSE, and Ulysses.  The box intersects with
the IPN arcs at the southern tip of the diamond.  We recommend
observers consider a circle with a radius of 5 arcminutes, centered on
the position R.A. = 18h14m25s, DEC = -14o1.7' (J2000)
