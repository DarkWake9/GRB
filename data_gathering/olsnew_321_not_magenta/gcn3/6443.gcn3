P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii) and T. Minezaki (IoA, Tokyo) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB070518 with the MAGNUM telescope
+ MIPS dual-beam camera.  Observations commenced 10.6 minutes after the
trigger, with a mid-point time of 2007 May 18.614 UTC.  Based on
calibration using a single USNO star (optical image; as for GCN #6418)
and single 2MASS star (NIR image), we find:

	R ~ 19.5 mag
	J ~ 18.8 mag
