behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:15:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140919A (trigger=613160).
The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA, Dec 221.556, -32.154 which is
    RA(J2000) = 14h 46m 13s
    Dec(J2000) = -32d 09' 14"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 100 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger.

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.2
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time.

Burst Advocate for this burst is M.E. Gropp (mgropp742 AT gmail.com).
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
