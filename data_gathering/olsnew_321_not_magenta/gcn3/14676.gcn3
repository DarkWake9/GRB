J. R. Cummings (UMBC/CRESST/GSFC) reports on behalf of the BAT team


At 13:55:07.4 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on the
Fermi GBM and LAT GRB 130518A (Xiong, GCN # 14674 and Omodei et al., GCN#
14675) (BAT trigger=556113).  No significant source was found onboard.  In
ground analysis, a significant source was found at RA, Dec 355.671, +47.478
which is:
    RA(J2000)  =23h 42m 41.1s 		
    Dec(J2000) = +47d 28' 41.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.9 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty).  This position is 11 arcmin from the LAT position,
within the LAT error circle.  BAT partial coding was 5%.  The unweighted
lightcurve shows two overlapping peaks with a duration of about 14 sec.
The peak count rate was ~9400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec before the
trigger.
