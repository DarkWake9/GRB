D. M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 20:18:17 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190727B (trigger=916733).  Swift could not slew to the location
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 126.481, -13.268 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 25m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = -13d 16' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~20,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 16:42 UT on 2019 September 12. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
