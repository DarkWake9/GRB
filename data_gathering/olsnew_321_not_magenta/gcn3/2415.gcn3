S. Mereghetti, D.Gotz (IASF, Milano)  and M. Beck (ISDC) for the ISDC IBAS
Localization Team, F. Mirabel (CEA, Saclay)  and the INTEGRAL Science
Working Team report:

During INTEGRAL Core Program observations of the Galactic Center region,
IBAS has detected several bursts from SGR 1806-20. They are summarized in
the following Table.

The positions derived by IBAS with typical errors smaller than 3 arcmin
confirm that all of them originated from SGR 1806-20 and not from the
nearby sources SGR 1808-20 (GCN 2351)  or XTE J1810-197 (IAUC 8168, IAUC
8190).

The bursts were detected with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument in the 15-100 keV
energy range.

In the near future IBAS will start to distribute automatic Alert Packets
for SGR bursts detected with high significance.  This will allow rapid
follow-up observations at other wavelengths.  The source coordinates in
the Alert Packets will allow IBAS users to distinguish such events from
classical GRBs.
