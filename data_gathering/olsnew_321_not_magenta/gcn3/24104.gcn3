M. J. B. Rosell, Matthew Shetrone, J. Craig Wheeler, Karl Gebhardt,
and Aaron Zimmerman, on behalf of the LIGO Hobby-Eberly Telescope
Response (LIGHETR) team report the spectroscopic observation of the
field of S190412m (GCN #24098) with the VIRUS IFU instrument on
the HET. We sampled a prioritized list of 7 galaxies from the GLADE
catalog that overlapped with the LIGO probability map and the observable
pupil of the HET. The resulting data cube covers the wavelength 350 to
550 nm at a resolving power of 750. The effective limiting magnitude in
the B band was 22 magnitudes. Each field is 50x50 arc seconds. We observed,
in order, galaxies
213.485626+32.349361, 214.212296+31.609276,
214.199814+32.783714, 214.708557+32.501812,
214.905014+33.619785, 215.054092+33.497181
and 218.171326+34.651875 that were numbers 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 1,
and 13, respectively, on our a priori mass-weighted galaxy list.
Report of the results will be submitted later.
