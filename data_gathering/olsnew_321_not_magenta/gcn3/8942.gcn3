S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:
 
The Swift-BAT trigger 345396 (at 13:54:24 UT on 06-Mar-09)
(Godet, Circ 8839) is not due to a GRB, nor anything astrophysical.
It is due to a comic ray particle shower event in the BAT instrument.
There were 105 counts in a single 100 microsec timestamp bin.
