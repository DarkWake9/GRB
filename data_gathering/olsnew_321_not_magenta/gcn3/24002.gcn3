reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:



At 22:44:02.64 UT on 24 March 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor

triggered and located GRB 190324A (trigger 575160247/190324947),

which was also detected by Swift (LaPorte e al. 2019, GCN 23993).

The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.



The GBM light curve shows an initial weak pulse followed by

a stronger signal containing two peaks. The duration (T90)

is about 26.9 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum

from T0+15.4 s to T0+32.8 s is adequately fit by a Band function

with Epeak = 144.3 +/- 8.4 keV, alpha = -0.84 +/- 0.04,

and beta = -2.06 +/- 0.05.



The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is

(1.78 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured

starting from T0+22.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 18.4 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.



The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;

final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
