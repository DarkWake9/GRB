SUBJECT: GRB 060505: Swift XRT afterglow canditate position

M.L. Conciatore, M. Capalbi, L. Vetere (ASDC), D. Palmer (LANL),
D. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 060505 field (trigger #208654,
Palmer et al., GCN 5076) at 20:58:25 UT, 14.37 h after the BAT trigger.
>From the analysis of the first 4 ks data set we find a faint source at
the following coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 22h 07m 03.2s
Dec(J2000) = -27d 48' 57"

with an estimated uncertainty of 5 arcseconds (90% containment). This
position lies 13.9 arcseconds from the center of the BAT error circle
reported in GCN 5076.

This source is 6.7 arcsec from the USNO star 0621-1164653 and 4.1
arcsec from the 2df galaxy S173Z112.

Due to the small number of counts, we are unable to determine whether
the source is decaying at this time. Observations are continuing and
further analysis regarding the fading nature of this source will be
issued as the data becomes available.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
