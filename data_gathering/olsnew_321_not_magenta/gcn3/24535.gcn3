A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), A. F. Valeev and V. V. Sokolov 
(SAO-RAS), Y.-D. Hu, X.-Y. Li, A. Ayala, and E.  Fernandez-Garcia 
(IAA-CSIC), R. Sanchez-Ramirez (INAF-IAPS), A. Castellon (UMA) and G. 
Gomez-Velarde (GRANTECAN, IAC, ULL), on behalf of a larger 
collaboration, report:

Following the detection of AT2019ezb and AT2019far (Srivastav et al., 
GCNC 24517) within the error area of the GW event S190510g (LVC, GCNC 
24442), we obtained optical spectra (900s) covering the range 3700-7500 
A with the 10.4m GTC telescope equipped with OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) 
starting on May 13, 23:55 UT.

The AT2019ezb spectrum is consistent with a SNIc at the host galaxy 
redshift (z=0.0712).

The AT2019far spectrum is consistent with a SNIIp at the host galaxy 
redshift (z=0.0583).

Therefore both transients are unrelated to the GW event S190510g.

We acknowledge the excellent support from the GTC staff.
