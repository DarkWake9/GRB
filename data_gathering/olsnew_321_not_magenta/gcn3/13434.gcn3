D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S. Mereghetti (IASF Milano), E. Bozzo, C. Ferrigno, L. Gibaud (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a long and bright GRB has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 02:44:48 UT on July 11th 2012. The GRB lasts approximately 135 s and its refined coordinates are

RA: 94.703 [degrees]
DEC: -71.001 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.1 arc min (90% c.l.).

A preliminary spectral analysis yields a fluence of 1.6e-5 erg/cmsq in the 20-200 keV energy band and a peak flux over 1 s of 10 photons/cmsq/s in the same energy band. Please note that due to telemetry saturation at satellite levels there values are only lower limits. 
We note that our position is consistent with the optical transient reported by Lacluyze et al. (CGN 13430).
