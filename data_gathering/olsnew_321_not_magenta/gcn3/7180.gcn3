D. A. Perley and J. S. Bloom report on behalf of the GRAASP collaboration:

Using Gemini-South (+GMOS), we obtained 2x60 seconds of imaging in g and 
and 1x60 seconds in r of NGC 2770 as acquisition images in preparation 
for later spectroscopic observations.  The sequence started at UT 05:33 
2008-01-11, 40.00 hours after the trigger time derived by Modjaz et al. 
(GCN 7175). Calibrating relative to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we 
measure the following magnitudes for XRF 080109 / SN 2008D (Berger & 
Soderberg, GCN 7159; Kong & Marcone, ATEL 1355) at this time:

g = 18.72 +/- 0.15
r = 18.10 +/- 0.07

For SN 2007uy, we derive g = 16.31 +/- 0.15, r = 15.86 +/- 0.07.
