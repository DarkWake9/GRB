Using the data set from T-61 to T+122 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060211
(trigger #181156)  (Mateos, et al., GCN 4739).  The BAT
ground-calculated position is (RA,Dec) = 75.076, 14.954  deg
{5h 0m 18.2s, 14d 57' 14.5"} (J2000) +- 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment).  The partial coding was 82%.

The mask-tagged light curve shows a multi-peak structure with possible
extended emission.  The burst started at T-12 sec with a small peak, then a
4-sec long peak at T+0 that decays out to ~T+10 sec and low-level
emission out to T+20 sec.  Additionally, there is a possible 10-sec wide weak
peak centered on T+100 sec and a possible faint precursor at T-22 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is (29 +- 5) sec (estimated error including systematics).
Since we do not have data past T+122 sec, we cannot say at this time anything
about the extended lightcurve.  We expect that it will take at least
a day to get that data downlinked.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.0 to T+21.7 is best fit by
a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.55 +- 0.21. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
(4.7 +- 0.6) x 10^-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+1.84 sec in the 15-150 keV band is (0.7 +- 0.1) ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
