TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2848
SUBJECT: GRB041211: Continued P60 Observations
DATE:    04/12/16 00:37:40 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. Bradley Cenko, Derek B. Fox, and Avishay Gal-Yam report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We have continued to monitor the SXC error circle of GRB041211 (H3622,
Dezalay et. al., GCN 2839) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope.  We
obtained 40 x 120-s I-band exposures on the evening of December 12 (mean
time 07:37 UT, 19.9 h after the burst), followed by 20 x 120-s I-band
images on the evening of December 13 (mean time 06:55 UT, 43.2 h after
the burst).  Digital subtraction revealed no variable source in the SXC
error circle or its immediate surroundings.  The limiting magnitude of
our observations, estimated by comparison with the USNO-B1 catalog, is I
< 23.

No further observations are planned."
