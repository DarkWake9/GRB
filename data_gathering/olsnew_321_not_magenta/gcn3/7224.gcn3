E. Troja (INAF/IASFPA), and D. N. Burrows (PSU) report
on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed 21 ks of XRT/PC data for the short GRB 080121 (trigger
301491; Cummings & Palmer, GCN 7209), starting 2.3 d after the burst.
No X-ray afterglow candidate is found within the BAT error circle
(GCN 7209). A faint source is detected within the BAT error circle at

RA(2000) = 09h 08m 46.36s,
Dec(J2000) = +41d 51' 21.1''

with an error radius 5 arcsec (90% containment). This source has a count
rate of ~2E-03 cts/s, and displays no fading behaviour.

We place a 3 sigma upper limit of 1E-03 cts/s on the X-ray afterglow count
rate, which corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 3.7E-14 erg/cm^2/s (over
0.3-10 keV), assuming a Crab-like spectrum and a Galactic absorption of
1.23E+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
