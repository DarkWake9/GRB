report:

We imaged the field of GRB 191221B detected by Swift (trigger 945521, 
Laha et al. GCN 26534) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the Zadko observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 19 hours after the GRB trigger. The elevation 
of the field was at 32 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good. We performed 6 long exposures of 180s in Clear filter.

We detected the candidate couterpart mentioned by Lipunov et al. (GCNC 
26537) in each of the images.

OT was R~17.6+/-0.2 at that time. Further analysis and observations are 
ongoing.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
