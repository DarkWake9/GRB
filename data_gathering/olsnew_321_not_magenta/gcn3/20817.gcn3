collaborations

On UT 2017-03-04, we spectroscopically classified the following optical
transient candidates (LVC GCN#20802, LVC GCN#20791) using the Double Beam
Spectrograph (Oke & Gunn 1982) on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope. All
spectra were reduced using the pyraf-dbsp pipeline (Bellm & Sesar 2016).
Classification were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007) and Superfit
(Howell et al. 2005).

Name, Redshift, Classification, Notes
iPTF17bue, z=0.02, SN Ia, Best match is SN2005cf at +4d
iPTF17buo, z=0, CV, Consistent with LVC GCN#20815
iPTF17bti, z=0, CV
iPTF17bxa, z=0.076, Spectrum dominated by galaxy light
iPTF17bub, z=0, M-dwarf flare
iPTF17btx, z=0.022, SN II, just outside 90% contour line
iPTF17bvw, z=0.132, SN Ia, Best match is SN2003du +0d
iPTF17bvd, Unknown, Blue Featureless Spectrum
iPTF17bva, z=0.112, SN Ia, Best match is SN1990N at -7d, just outside 90%
contour line
