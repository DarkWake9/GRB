Paul M. Vreeswijk, Johan P. U. Fynbo, Daniele Malesani, Jens Hjorth 
(DARK/NBI), Antonio de Ugarte Postigo (ESO), report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 080905B (Stroh et al., GCN 8182) with the 
ESO VLT equipped with FORS2. Several spectra were obtained with 
different grism choices, beginning on 2008 Sep 6.053  UT (8.34 hr after 
the GRB), and covering the wavelength ranges 3800-9500 AA at low to 
moderate resolution.

In the acquisition images, we clearly detect a point source inside the 
refined XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 8189), at the coordinates 
(J2000):

RA = 20:06:57.90
Dec = -62:33:46.8

This position is consistent with that of the UVOT candidate afterglow 
reported by Stroh et al. (GCN 8182), the object being now significantly 
fainter (R ~ 20.2). We note that this position is 3.8" off the center of 
the bright 2MASS galaxy 2MASX J20065732-6233465, also visible in the DSS 
and in the UVOT images.

Spectroscopy of the afterglow reveals resonance absorption features from 
several ions, including OI, SiII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, MgII, MgI, at 
a redshift z = 2.374. The detection of transitions from fine-structure 
levels of FeII indicates that this is the redshift of the GRB, under the 
assumption that these levels are populated by GRB afterglow ultraviolet 
photons. We also find evidence for an intervening absorber at z = 1.438.

We acknowledge excellent support from the Paranal staff, in particular 
Elena Mason and Andres Pino.
