In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200225q at T0 = 2020-02-25
06:04:21.396 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows
that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered the 40% of the
90% c.l. localization region (LR; 39% of the LR is occulted by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10
GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S200225q 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

from 9.8e-07 to 3.9e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 40% of the
LR over the time interval (T0 - 2 s ; T0 + 2 s );
from 3.6e-07 to 1.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 40% of the
LR over the time interval (T0 s ; T0 + 10 s);
from 3.0e-08 to 1.2e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 40% of the
LR over the time interval (T0 s ; T0 + 100 s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
