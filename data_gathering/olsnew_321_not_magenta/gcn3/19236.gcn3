We observed the field of GRB 160327A (Racusin, et al., GCN 19235) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/03 27.39 to 2016/03 27.41 UTC (3.6
minutes to 0.58 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.15 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS
DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections:

r    21.78 +/- 0.13
i    19.68 +/- 0.02
Z   18.55 +/- 0.02
Y   17.75 +/- 0.01
J    17.56 +/- 0.01
H   16.74 +/- 0.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. The source is located at RA, Dec =
9:46:48.54, +54:0:46.4 (J2000, +/-0.5").

Further observations are planned.

Mártir.
