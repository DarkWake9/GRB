J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC/UPV-EHU), S. Hellmich (DLR), S. Mottola (DLR), on
behalf of a larger collaboration report:

We observed the GRB 141004A (D'Elia et al. GCN 16878) field with the 1.23m
CAHA telescope. The observations were done in the Ic-band starting on Oct
4.9969 UT (34.6 minutes post GRB). A preliminary analysis detects a faint
optical object located at (RA, DEC)=05:06:56.17, 12:49:10.8 (+/-0.7"), so
consistent with the UVOT position. We estimate a preliminary Vega
magnitude of Ic~19.2, calibrated against the USNO B1.0 catalog.
