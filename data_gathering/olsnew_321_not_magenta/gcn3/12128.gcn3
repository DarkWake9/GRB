E. Berger (Harvard) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the unusual GRB 110709B (GCNs 12122, 12124) with
GMOS on the Gemini-South 8-m telescope starting on 2011 July 10.032 UT (3.2
hr after the initial trigger).  Images were obtained at high airmass and in
poor seeing (1.7").  In a stack of 5x180 sec r-band exposures we find a
single faint source within the XRT error circle (GCN 12122) at (J2000):

RA = 10:58:37.38
DEC = -23:27:21.21

With an uncertainty of about 0.3" in each coordinate.  This source is
consistent with the position of the DSS-II source reported by Levan (GCN
12126).  Additional analysis is in progress."
