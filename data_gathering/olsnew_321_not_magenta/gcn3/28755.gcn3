Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201021C (trigger #1001130)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 28730).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 12.503, -55.862 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 50m 00.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 51' 44.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak running from ~T-5 sec to 
T+20 sec, with a broad peak around T+3 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 24.38 +- 6.76 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.19 to T+27.95 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-3.62 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
