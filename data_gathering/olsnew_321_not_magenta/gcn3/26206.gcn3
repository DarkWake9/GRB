Verrecchia (SSDC, and INAF/OAR), A. Bulgarelli, N. Parmiggiani (INAF/OAS-Bologna), M. Pilia (INAF/OA-Cagliari), F. Longo (Univ. Trieste, and INFN Trieste), report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S191109d at T0 = 2019-11-09 01:07:17 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, 100% of the S191109d 90 c.l. localization region was accessible to the AGILE MCAL.Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the accessible S191109d localization region, from a minimum of 1.47E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 6.95E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
