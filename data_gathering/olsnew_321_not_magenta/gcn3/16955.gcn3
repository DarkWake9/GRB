D. A. Perley, M. Brown, I. Wong, and E. Bailey (Caltech) report:

We imaged the location of GRB 141026A (Hagen et al., GCN 16950) using 
the Large-Format Camera on the 5m Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. 
  Six exposures of four minutes each were acquired using the Broad-RI 
(620-920 nm) filter between 03:34:50 and 04:03:51 UT (58-87 minutes 
after the BAT trigger).

The object north of the error circle reported by Littlejohns et al. (GCN 
16592), Varela et al. (GCN 16953), and Gorosabel et. al (GCN 16954) is 
well-detected in the stacked image.  No other object is detected in or 
near the XRT error circle, including at the position of the 
previously-reported, low-significance object from the early P60 imaging 
(GCN 16951), down to a limit of RI > 25.5 mag (calibrated relative to 
the R2 magnitude of a nearby USNO B1.0 star).
