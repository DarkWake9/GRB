collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al, 2020,
arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 210324C, which was also
detected by Fermi-GBM (GCN #29718), and Konus-Wind (GCN #29728).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light
curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-03-24 20:00:36.50 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the
burst is 214 (+47, -35) cts/s above the background in the combined data of
four quadrants, with a total 4856 (+784, -875) cts. The local mean
background count rate was 604 (+3, -3) cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we
measure a T90 of 63 (+14, -11) s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and
PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated
the project.
