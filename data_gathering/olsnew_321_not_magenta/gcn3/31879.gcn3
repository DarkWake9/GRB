CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 
2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed detection of a long GRB 220411A which was 
also detected by Fermi - GBM (Trigger No. 220411306, GCN  31871) with 
BALROG localisation reported (Kunzweiler et al., GCN 31872).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range in three 
quadrants (out of four). Two quadrants were noisy and we exclude them in 
further analysis. The light curve peaked at 2022-04-11 07:20:02.25 UT. 
The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 337 (+151, 
-22) counts/s above the background in the combined data of two 
quadrants, with a total of 1155 (+298, -200) counts. The local mean 
background count rate was 254 (+4, -5) counts/s. Using cumulative rates, 
we measure a T90 of  19 (+1, -2) s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector 
in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve showed a single peak of 
emission at 2022-04-11 07:20:01.00 UT. The measured peak count rate is 
499 (+73, -77) counts/s above the background in the combined Veto data 
of four quadrants, with a total of 2897 (+734, -604) counts. The local 
mean background count rate was 1722 (+3, -5) counts/s. We measure a T90 
of 26 (+13, -10) s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at 
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb [1]. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led 
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC, 
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and 
facilitated the project.
