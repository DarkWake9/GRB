report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2020-10-16T00:27:49.500 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 201016A (trigger ID: HEB201016019) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Fermi/GBM (Wood J. et al., GCN #28646) and 
AstroSat/CZTI (Gupta S. et al., GCN #28651).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 3.36 s measured from T0+6.06 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+7.47 s, is 20372 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 57956 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
