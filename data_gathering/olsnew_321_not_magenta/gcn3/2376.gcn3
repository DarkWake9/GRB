M. P. Rupen and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Using the VLA at 8.5 GHz we imaged a 60-arcsec region centered on the
Chandra position for SGR 1806-20 (Kaplan et al., ApJ 564, 935, 2002).
This short 9 min integration was made on 2003 September 3.15 UT,
concurrent with a planned 240 ksec INTEGRAL target of opportunity
observation (GCN#2372). No radio source was detected at or near this
position. The rms noise was 55 microJy/beam, for a beam size of
450 x 240 mas (p.a. 12 degrees). The min/max within the Chandra
±0.3 arcsec error circle were (-121,+153) microJy/beam. No further
observations are planned."
