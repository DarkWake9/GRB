Y. Hu, A. Sota and A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on behalf of a 
larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 160824A by Swift (Evans et al. GCNC 
19855), optical images in the I-band  were obtained at the 1.5m OSN 
telescope in Granada (Spain) starting at 01:25 (Aug 25), i.e. 2.05 h 
postburst. No optical afterglow is detected in the co-added image (13 x 
300s, mid time 02:00 UT, 2.6 h after the trigger) within the enhanced 
Swift/XRT error box (Goad et al. GCNC 19857) down to I = 20.0.
