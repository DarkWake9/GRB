Quick-Look-Analysis of the XMM-Newton observation
of GRB030227 (G. Gotz et al. GCN 1895 and 1896), based on
1 and 2 ks non-simultaneous exposures in the EPIC MOS and pn
cameras, respectively, shows the presence of one source in the
refined IBIS error circle:

S1 (J2000): R.A. =  4h 57m 33s   Decl. = 20deg  29' 9"
with an estimated EPIC/pn count rate of 0.2 [counts/sec];

A second source, only marginally consistent with the error box
reported in GCN1896, is detected in the MOS cameras:

S2 (J2000): R.A. =  4h 57m 17s   Decl. = 20deg  30' 18"

At this stage of reduction the positional error is expected to
be less than 6".
