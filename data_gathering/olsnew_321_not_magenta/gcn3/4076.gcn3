TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4076
SUBJECT: GRB 051008: R-band upper limit

P. Ferrero and S. Klose, Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg,

report:


We have further analysed the R-band images of the error box of GRB
051008 obtained on October 8.7514 UT (mean time, i.e. 1.6 hrs after the
burst) with the Tautenburg Schimdt telescope, previously reported by
Klose & Hoegner (GCN 4072). Photometric calibration was performed
using the USNO-A2.0 catalog (Monet et al. 1996).

We do not detect any souce in the XRT error circle (Perri et al., GCN
4073) as well as at the position of the bright radio source reported
by Cameron et al. (GCN 4074) down to an R-band magnitude of about
19.5. This finding is not unusual compared to what is known so far
about the properties of Swift afterglows (cf. Berger et al.,
astro-ph/0505107).
