C. Guidorzi, S. Dichiara (U. Ferrara), C.G. Mundell (LJMU)
on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope South began observing Swift GRB 140719A
(Starling et al. GCN Circ 16606) on July 19 at 09:27:35 UT, i.e.
~3.6 hours after the BAT trigger, with the r' and i' filters.

Within the enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 16607)
and, in particular, at the position of the GROND candidate
(GCN Circ. 16611) we found nothing down to the following limit:

Mid time from  Total Exp   Filter    Magnitude
trigger (hr)   (s)
-------------------------------------------------
3.64           120x4       r'        > 21.0
3.80           120x4       i'        > 20.2
-------------------------------------------------

Magnitudes are calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 stars.
