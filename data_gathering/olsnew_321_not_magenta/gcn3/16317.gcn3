Ayvazian (AAO), Yu. Krugly (IA KhNU), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed a field of the Swift GRB 140521A(Troja et al., GCN 16311) 
with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory starting on May, 
21 (UT) 18:12:00. We obtained several unfiltered  frames with exposure 
of 120 s. Within the BAT ground-calculated position (Barthelmy et al., 
GCN 16316) we do not detect evident variable source. Since our stacked 
image is somewhat deeper than USNO-B1.0 we need one more epoch of 
observation.

The details of the photometry are the following:

UT start             t-T0         Filter   Exp.    Uplim
                     (mid, days)   (s)              (3 sigma)
2014-05-21 18:12:00  0.05746      None    28*120   21.2

and based on USNO-B1.0 star 1575-0248114  (21:20:10.32 +67:35:37.5) 
assuming R=15.70.
