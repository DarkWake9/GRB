Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160712A (trigger #704155)
(Hagen, et al., GCN Circ. 19684).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 304.166, -26.965 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  20h 16m 39.9s
  Dec(J2000) = -26d 57' 52.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 24%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows the burst starting at ~T-5 sec, with a spike
at ~T0 sec, extending past T+95 sec where the data ends when the burst position
moves out of the BAT FOV due to a slew.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.60 to T+45.46 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.18 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.4 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
