Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) and A. von Kienlin (MPE) report on behalf of the
Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:22:25.87 UT on 12 May 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150512A (trigger 453118948 / 150512432),
which was also detected by the iPTF (Singer et al. 2015,GCN 17809).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the positions of the
potential transient sources reported by iPTF (Singer et al. 2015,
GCN 17809). The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight
was 95 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several peaks with a total duration
(T90) of about 123 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-20 s to T0+104 s is best fit by a BAND function with Epeak = 121.5
+/- 18.7 keV, alpha = -0.9 +/- 0.1 and Beta = -2.0 +/- 0.1. The event
fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.17 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2.
The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+101 s in the 10-1000
keV band is 5.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
