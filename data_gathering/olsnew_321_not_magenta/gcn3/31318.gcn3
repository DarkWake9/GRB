Y.-D. Hu, T.-R. Sun, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia, R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga), R. Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC) and M. Jelinek (ASU-CAS), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 211227A by Swift (Beardmore et al. GCNC 31316), the 0.6m BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) automatically responded to this burst starting on Dec. 27 at 23:32:49 UT (~43 s after trigger). But due to technical problems, only images taken after 23:42 UT (~10 min after trigger) could be used. No new source is detected within the XRT error region in the co-added image (20 x 10 s, clear filter) down to 19.9 mag. This non-detection is consistent with the report from MASTER (Lipunov et al. GCNC 31315) and UVOT (Beardmore et al. GCNC 31316).

We thank the staff at La Mayora for its excellent support.
