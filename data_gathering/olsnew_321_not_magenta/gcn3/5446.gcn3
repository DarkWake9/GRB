The long GRB 060813 (Swift-BAT trigger #224364;
Moretti et al., GCN 5442; Cummings et al., GCN 5443)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=82221.576 s UT (22:50:21.576).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst shows
a single pulse with a duration of ~6 s,
followed by a weak soft tail seen up to T-T0 ~13 s.
The burst fluence is (1.18 +/- 0.07)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and the 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+5.136 s
(2.96 +/- 0.58)x10^-6  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+6.656 s; in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.53 (-0.14,+0.16),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.65(-0.49, +0.26),
the break energy E0 = 130(-23, +27) keV (chi2 = 58/47 dof).
The peak energy Ep = 192(-18, +20) keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
