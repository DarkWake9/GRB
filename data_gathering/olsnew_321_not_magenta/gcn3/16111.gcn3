We present refined analysis of the short-hard burst GRB 140414A (Cummings,
GCN Circ. #16110).  The best BAT position is still RA, Dec 195.310, +56.902,
which is:

RA (J2000) 13h 01m 14.3s 	
Dec (J2000) 56d 54' 06"

with an estimated uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin (90% containment).

The light curve shows two main peaks each about 0.3 seconds long, the second
about 3 times as intense and peaking about 0.3 seconds after the first.  T90 is
estimated as 0.7 +- 0.1 seconds.

The spectrum is best fit by a simple powerlaw function with a photon index of
0.74 +- 0.18.  The fluence in 0.7 seconds was (1.22 +- 0.10) x 10^-7 ergs/cm^2.
Errors are 90% confidence.

A Swift TOO request was approved to locate the afterglow with XRT, with the
observation ID 20375.  Unfortunately, the star tracker did not find enough
targets to lock.  Swift will not reobserve the target.
