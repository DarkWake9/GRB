P. D'Avanzo, D. Fugazza, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASI/ASDC) report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the short GRB 130912A (D'Elia et al., GCN 15212) simultaneously in the optical and near infrared with the the 60-cm robotic telescope REM at La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 08:47:33 UT, 12.6 min after the GRB.

No source is detected within the XRT error circle nor at the position of the possible host galaxy reported by Tanga et al. (GCN 15214). The limiting magnitudes are r'=19.6 and H=16.1 (Vega; calibrated against the USNOB1 and the 2MASS catalogue, respectively) at a mid t-t0=17.5 minutes.
