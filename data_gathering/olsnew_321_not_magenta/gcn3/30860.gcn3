collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 210919A (Tohuvavohu et al.,
GCN Circ. 30846) using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m
Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ. Observations
started on September 21, 11:27:43 UT (2.46 days after the Swift
trigger) taking 5 exposures of 200 s each with SDSS r filter.
Observations were taken at an airmass of about 1.27 and seeing of
about 1.5". We do not find any source inside the enhanced
XRT position (Goad et al., GCN Circ. 30850) down to a 3-sigma
limiting magnitude of r>23.6 AB mag.
Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and not
corrected for Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance
with these observations.
