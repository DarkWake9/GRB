K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), M.G.
Bernardini (INAF-OAB), E. Ambrosi  (INAF-IASFPA) , M. Capalbi
(INAF-IASFPA), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), B.
Sbarufatti (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Fermi/GBM and Swift-BAT/GUANO detected burst GRB 201008A (DeLaunay et
al. GCN Circ. 28583). The observations now extend from T0+47.0 ks to
T0+650.8 ks. 

Of the sources reported by Page et al. (GCN Circ. 28587), "Source 4" is
fading with 3-sigma significance, and is therefore likely the GRB
afterglow.  The position of this source is RA, Dec=161.8588, +46.1019
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 10:47:26.10
Dec(J2000): +46:06:06.9

with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 4.8 arcmin from the BAT/GUANO position.  The source is
fading with alpha >0.8.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
