Observer: D. T. Durig  ( CLW01 )
Report: Started 2 hours of 30 second unguided exposures and got a few
thicker clouds near the end. So I added the first 150 good frames, total
exposure 75 minutes. No OT observed, but there is a dim background
variation at S/N~2 near reported position. Two accumulated hot pixels
nearby center at 1 oclock position and one near top center of frame are
artifacts. Gif image at http://arthur.sewanee.edu/obsv/view.php
Bright moonlight made background very bad and limited depth of
coverage.

Observer: Stefano Sposetti
Report: Observations begun at 19:45UT, aug 8th, about 29h later the
Swift-BAT trigger, under good sky conditions affected by moonlight. A
90min stacked R-filtered image centred at 20:45UT doesn't show any OT
brighter than 20mag (USNO A2.0 catalog).
