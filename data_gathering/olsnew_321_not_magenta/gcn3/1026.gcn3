A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired preliminary BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the HETE localization
for GRB010326 (GCN 1015) with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope
on one marginally photometric night with poor seeing.  Stars
brighter than V=14 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb010326a.dat
The current photometry has a potential external zero-point
error of about three percent.  The astrometry in this file
is based on linear plate solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.
The internal errors are less than 100mas.
  Further calibration of this field will not be performed
unless an optical counterpart is discovered.
