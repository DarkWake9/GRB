Cucchiara A. (PSU), Cannizzo J. (NASA/UMBC)  reports on
behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:
 
The Swift/UVOT observed the field of  GRB061210 starting
2.42 days after the BAT trigger (Cannizzo et al.,
GCN Circ. 5904).
No afterglow optical candidate is detected in either of the
XRT error circles in 18.5 ks of exposure time from T+2.42 days
to T+3.48 days in U band.
We clearly detect the extended source near the candidate S1
(Berger et al., GCN Circ. 5922) at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000)  =  09:37:57.92
DEC(J2000) = +15:36:32.6

with a 1 sigma error radius of about 0.5 arcsec.
The estimated UVOT/U magnitude is 21.0 +/- 0.1.
In a second epoch image taken from T+3.5 days to T+3.64 after
the trigger the source is still present and it is not fading.
The estimated magnitude in 12 ks coadded image is 21.0 +/- 0.1.

In the position of the candidate S2 we estimate a 3 sigma upper
limit of 22.06.
 
The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction of E_{B-V} = 0.035 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
