report:

We observed the field of GRB 130418A (de Pasquale et al., GCN 14377) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 22.14 to 2013/04 22.33 UTC (80.35
to 84.95 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.84 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 1.19 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and
H bands.


At the position of the transient observed on 2013/04/19 (GCN 14388) and
2013/04/20 (GCN 14404), in comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we obtain
the following upper limits (3-sigma) in the AB magnitude system:

 r'> 23.12
 i'> 22.93
 Z > 22.52
 Y > 21.89
 J > 21.85
 H > 21.25

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.  The source is thus more than about 1 magnitude fainter than it
was observed to be two days ago.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
