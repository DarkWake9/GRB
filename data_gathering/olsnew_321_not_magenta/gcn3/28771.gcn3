P. Gokuldass (UVI), R. Strausbaugh (UVI), N. Orange (OrangeWave Innovative
Science, LLC), D. Morris (UVI), A. Cucchiara (UVI/College of Marin) report:

We observed the field of GRB201024A (F. E. Marchall et al., GCN 28761) with
the
0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) at the University of the Virgin
Islands' Etelman Observatory on 10-24-2020 starting at 06:39:34.2 UT (T+3.3
hrs). We performed a series of exposures in R filter with a total exposure
of 1430 s. The weather conditions were partly cloudy during the hours of

observation with an average arimass of 1.5.


We find no new source within the enhanced XRT position error circle
(P. A. Evans et al., 28770) and report the following 3-sigma upper limit:

T_mid       ||Exposure     ||Filter      ||Limit
T+ 5 hrs    ||1430s          ||R            ||>18.9

The limit is estimated from comparison to nearby USNO B1 stars and is not
corrected for Galactic extinction. The VIRT is still in the commissioning
phase.
