report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

During an RXTE PCA observation from an ongoing ~weekly SGR
monitoring campaign, we have detected a recurrence of burst
activity from SGR 1806-20.  During two 5 ks observations of
the source on 12 August 2000, we detected two brief, intense
bursts.  The brighter of the two bursts reached a peak flux
(4ms) of ~5e-7 ergs/cm^2 s (>25keV).

Further observations are encouraged.
