The Swift GRB 080413B (Swift/BAT trigger #309111 ; Stamatikos et al., GCN 7598) 
was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 8:51:11.645 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a single peak starting at T0-0s, 
with a duration (T90) of about 2 seconds. The fluence in 150 - 1000 keV 
was (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+1s was 
3.4 +/- 0.2 photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-1s to T0+8s 
is fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of 3.02 (+0.36, -0.32) 
(chi^2/d.o.f = 16.7/16) in 150 - 1000 keV. All the quoted errors are at statistical 
90% confidence level, in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
