J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P. Wozniak, and H. Davis,
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR network of robotic optical telescopes made observations of Swift trigger 629578 (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 17377).  Our narrow-field instruments located in Los Alamos, NM, USA, arrived on target 4.6 s after receipt of the notice (T+30.9 s after the BAT trigger time).  No optical counterpart is detected within the Swift XRT counterpart location.  Typical 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for our initial 5 s exposures were R~16.6 and I~15.7 based on comparision to the USNO-B1 R-band catalog.

The burst location was also within the field of view of our wide-field sky monitors during the gamma-ray emitting interval.  No optical counterpart is detected in any of our wide-field monitor images.  Typical 3-sigma unfiltered limiting magnitudes during this period were V~9.7 based on comparison to the
Tycho-2 V-band catalog.
