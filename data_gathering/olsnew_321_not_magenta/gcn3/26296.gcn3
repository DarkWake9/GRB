J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 191122A (GCN 26276), 
the reported position:

RA: 27.25 (+1.70/-2.90 deg - 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -0.04 (+1.17/-1.49 deg - 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 24 minutes prior
until 11 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations are not 
constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
