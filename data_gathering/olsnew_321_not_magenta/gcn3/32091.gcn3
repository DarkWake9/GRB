R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 220521A (Dicharia et al., GCN 32076; Fermi GBM Team, GCN 32075) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the Teide Observatory, Tenerife site, on May 22, from 00:04 to 00:32 UT (corresponding to 0.73 to 1.20 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel R and I filters.

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in R and I bands. We detect an optical counterpart at the NOT optical afterglow location (Malesani et al., 32078 GCN 32078) that is consistent with other optical detections (Malesani et al., GCN 32078; Fynbo et al., GCN 32079; Goranskij et al., GCN 32082). The following magnitudes are calculated using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference:

R=21.57+/-0.23
I=18.61+/-0.63

These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682
