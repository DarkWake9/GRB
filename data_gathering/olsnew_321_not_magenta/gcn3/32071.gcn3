B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

On May 19th at 20:10:11 UT BAT triggered on Sco X-1 while the Swift
Start Tracker had lost lock.  This was not an event of astrophysical
origin, and the automated notices should not have been distributed to
the world. The Swift team is investigating why the notices were
distributed.
