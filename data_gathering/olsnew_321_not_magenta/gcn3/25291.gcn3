The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving 
from the direction of HAWC Burst Alert 1008846_957 (GCN 25284) in a time 
window 12 hours in duration centered on the burst time (2019-08-06 07:20:48.0 UTC 
to 2019-08-06 19:20:48.0 UTC), during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. 
Zero track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with the location of the HAWC 
alert during this time period. Accordingly, the time-integrated muon-neutrino flux, 
multiplied by E^2, upper limit at the alert position assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) 
at the 90% CL is 3.53 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. 90% of events 
IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum 
are between approximately 1 TeV and 3 PeV.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating 
at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact 
can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.
