report:


The HETE Fregate, WXM and SXC instruments detected burst H3804 at
11:22 UT on 14 June 2005.  The burst is soft (all photons < 30 keV),
has a FRED-like profile, and exhibits the general spectral and temporal
characteristics of a type I X-ray burst.

H3804 is localized by the WXM and SXC to a circle of radius 80" centered 
at RA = 19h 00m 6.4s, Dec = -24d 54' 54.7" (J2000).
 
H3804 is situated within 15 degrees of the galactic center:  l=11, b=-13.
It does not appear to coincide with any entry for an X-ray source in the 
SIMBAD catalog.  Thus, it is very likely to be a new, previously uncatalogued 
XRB, and not an XRF or a GRB, although we cannot absolutely exclude that 
possibility.
