Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160703A (trigger #702699)
(Cenko, et al., GCN Circ. 19645).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 287.414, 36.913 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 09m 39.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 54' 46.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 84%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows many overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-26 sec, with the brightest peak at ~T+28 sec, and ending at ~T+75 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 44.4 +- 2.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-26.43 to T+52.57 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+26.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
