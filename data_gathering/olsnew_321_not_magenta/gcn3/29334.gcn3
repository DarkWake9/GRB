The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:10:44 UT on 20 Jan 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210120A (trigger 632819449.704302 / 210120299).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 163.4, Dec = 17.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 53m, 17d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
