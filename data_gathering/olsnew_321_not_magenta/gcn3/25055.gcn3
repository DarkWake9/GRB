The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:16:41 UT on 12 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190712A (trigger 584590606.72695 / 190712095).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 288.4, Dec = 56.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 13m, 56d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
