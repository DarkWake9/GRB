GRB 080514B was discovered by the SuperAGILE detector on May 
14th, at 09:55:56 UT (Rapisarda et al., GCN Circ. 7715) and 
possibly detected at energies E>50 MeV in AGILE GRID data 
(Giuliani et al., GCN Circ. 7716). 

The first Swift/XRT observation was performed on May 14th at 
20:12, starting about 37 ks after the GRB trigger (Page et al., 
GCN Circ. 7723). A likely afterglow candidate was found, with a 
flux decay described by a power-law (slope: 1.5+/-1.0; GCN Circ. 
7723). The spectrum was modelled with an absorbed ( 1.2x10^21 cm^-2) 
power-law, with photon index = 2.06 (GCN Circ. 7723).

Swift/XRT observed again the field of GRB 080514B on May 16th at 
20:13, about 58 hours after the trigger. 6 ks of data in Photon 
Counting mode were collected in three consecutive orbits, spanning 
5 hours.

The candidate X-ray afterglow (GCN Circ. 7723) is significantly 
detected with a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of (1.9+/-0.8)x10^-13 
erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming the spectrum of Circ. 7723). 

The new XRT data confirm the fading trend reported in (GCN Circ. 
7723) and better constrain the decay slope at 1.6 +0.3/-0.2. 

We thank the Swift PI, N. Gehrels, for approval of this TOO, and 
the the Swift team (in particular the duty scientists and science 
planners) for performing it.
