V. D’Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (IAA-CSIC), A. A. Breeveld (UCL-MSSL), C. B.  
Markwardt (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

The source reported in D’Elia et al. (GCN Circ. 19481) as an X-ray  
afterglow candidate for GRB 160530A (Tomsick, GCN Circ. 19473; Svinkin  
et al., GCN Circ. 19476) does not show any sign of fading during the  
Swift-XRT observations. Several X-ray sources have been detected  
during the XRT follow-up campaign, but again, none of them show  
evidence of fading. We thus conclude that the X-ray afterglow  
associated with GRB 160530A was not identified by our observations.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
