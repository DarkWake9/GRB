The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160408A (Evans et al., GCN 19260) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Apr 08.61, Apr 09.77, Apr 
13.87, Apr 15.74, and Apr 19.78 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Osborne et al., GCN 19261), with 3sigma upper limits 
of 117 uJy, 144 uJy, 102 uJy, 204 uJy, and 145 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
