"At 07:31:39.00 UT on 26 March 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190326B (trigger 575278303 / 190326314).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, 
is RA = 264.2, DEC = 68.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent
to 17h 37m, 68d 18'), with an uncertainty of 1.3 degrees 
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally a 
systematic error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, 
with 90% of GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a 
larger than 10 deg systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 21 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple pulses with a duration (T90)
of about 56 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from 
T0-2.048 s to T0+59.393 s is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 163 +/- 14 keV,
alpha = -0.33 +/- 0.10, and beta = -1.93 +/- 0.07

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.78 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+56.5128 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 7.8 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
