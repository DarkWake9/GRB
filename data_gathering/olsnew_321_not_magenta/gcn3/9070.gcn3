SUBJECT: GRB 090401B: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    09/04/01 13:51:40 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 2409 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT
images for GRB 090401B, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 95.08773, -8.97244 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 06h 20m 21.06s
Dec (J2000): -08d 58' 20.8"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, arXiv:0812.3662).
