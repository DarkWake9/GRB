GRB 080413: ROTSE-III Detection of Optical Counterpart

E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), W. Rujopakarn (Steward), report on behalf of the ROTSE
collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 080413A (Swift trigger 309096). The first image was at
02:54:39.7 UT, 20.4 s after the burst (6.7 s after the GCN notice time).
The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a
12.8 magnitude, fading source with coordinates:

19:09:11.8 -27:40:41.6 (J2000), with positional uncertainty of 1' or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker
database.

marked 7 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
