We observed the location of the recently discovered GRB 170524A (Gropp et
al., GCNC 21135) with the 0.5m robotic telescope D50 located in Ondřejov,
Czech Republic. The unfiltered CCD observations started 4 hours after the
trigger, once the position got available above local horizon, and had to be
interrupted after 20 minutes because of passing clouds. The sum of all
images obtained has a mean exposure time 00:02:23UT, i.e. 4.22h after the
GRB, and a limiting magnitude of R>20.2. No object was detected within the
XRT errorbox (Evans et al., GCNC 21136).
