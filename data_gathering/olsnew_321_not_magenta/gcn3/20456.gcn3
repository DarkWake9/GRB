Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170113A (trigger #732526)
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 20446).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 61.735, -71.933 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 06m 56.5s
   Dec(J2000) = -71d 55' 58.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~T0 and ends at ~T+25 s. The main peak occurs at ~T+2 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 20.66 +- 4.44 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.61 to T+23.84 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.75 +- 0.59,
and Epeak of 73.3 +- 33.6 keV (chi squared 72.24 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.7 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+1.63 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.57 +- 0.13 (chi squared 79.06 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
