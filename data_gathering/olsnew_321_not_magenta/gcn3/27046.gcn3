R. Gaikwad, S. Gupta, V. Sharma, A. Vibhute and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of the long GRB 2002011A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN #27031) and BALROG (Biltzinger B. et al., GCN #27032).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed a single peak of emission peaking at 2020-02-11 07:26:31.01 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 220 +/- 28.6 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1006 +/- 46.0 cts. The local mean background count rate was 510 +/- 16.3 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 12.0 +/- 0.19 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
