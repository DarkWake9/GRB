report:  "The field of GRB980425 (IAUC 6884) was re-observed with the
BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments on 1998 November 10.754-12.004 UT.
Preliminary analysis of the MECS data shows that the source
1SAXJ1935.0-5248 reported in the GCN N. 61 and 69, the position of
which (see updated coordinates in GCN N. 155) is consistent with that
of the supernova SN1998bw (Galama et al. 1998, Nature 395, 670), has
a count rate of (1.8 +- 0.4)x10E-03 cts/s in the 1.6-10 keV range,   
and therefore has decreased by approximately a factor of two with    
respect to the average level observed in April-May (see GCN N. 61 and
69). This suggests the presence of variable X-ray emission from the
supernova.
This preliminary analysis shows also that the source 1SAXJ1935.0-5248
is slightly extended.
 
The source 1SAXJ1935.3-5252 (see GCN N. 61, 69, 155) is not detected
down to a 3-sigma limit of 1.4E-03 cts/s.
