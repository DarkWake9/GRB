We observed 45 sqdeg in two epochs covering the field of S170728q
(LIGO/Virgo, S. Antier, GCN #25208)  in r' band with the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST) equipped with Omegacam (1 sqdeg FOV) (Proposal ID ESO
0103.D-0070 ).

Observations of the first epoch started on 2019-07-29 at 03:14 UT and ended
at 06:52. Observations of the second epoch started on 2019-07-30 at 03:01
end ended at 06:56 UT.  The observations, covering 65% of the localization
probability region,  were organized in group of 3x3 deg, the coordinates of
the center of each group are:

RA(J2000) Dec(J2000)
------------------------

319.55602 18.0797
317.09440 15.01752
315.45366 12.04954
313.95922 8.53513
313.16805 5.85237

Each 1 sqdeg pointing was observed three times for a total exposure time of
135 seconds.The average 50% completeness for point sources is 22.4 mag.
Analysis of the images is in progress.
We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO User Support Department and
from ESO observing staff in Paranal.
