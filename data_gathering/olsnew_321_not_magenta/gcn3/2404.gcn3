Odyssey GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, S. Charyshnikov, V. Grinkov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, and
A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and Mars Odyssey-HEND and GRS, observed this GRB
at 66648 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 18 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.5E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 2000 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

                           RA(2000)            DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   1 h 58 m 54.54 s      -20 o 04 ' 28.12 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 2 h 01 m 21.28 s      -24 o 11 ' 15.54 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 2 h 01 m 04.85 s      -24 o 12 ' 57.87 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 1 h 56 m 43.51 s      -15 o 56 ' 04.33 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 1 h 56 m 28.55 s      -15 o 57 ' 34.72 "
 
Only slight improvements to this error box are expected.
