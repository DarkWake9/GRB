Guy Pooley, MRAO, Cavendish Lab, University of Cambridge reports:

The Ryle Telescope (Cambridge, UK) was used to map the field
containing GRB051109A (GCN 4211) at 15GHz. The observation ran from
2005Nov09 12h57m to 2005Nov10 00h54m, centred 17h45m after the
initial detection.
No source was detected at the position of the GRB
(Rykoff et al, GCN 4211; Holland et al, GCN 4235);
the formal value was  S = 0.40 mJy with rms noise 0.16 mJy.

When the data were divided into two halves,
the resulting estimates of flux density were
First  half (centred on 2005Nov09.75) 0.25 +- 0.23 mJy
Second half (centred on 2005Nov10.25) 0.54 +- 0.23 mJy
