on behalf of a large collaboration report:

We observed Fermi GRB 140723A (Bissaldi et al. GCN Circ 16623;
Burns et al. GCN Circ. 16626) with one of the Las Cumbres
Observatory 1-m telescopes in Sutherland (South Africa) on
July 23 at 16:51:02 UT, i.e. ~15.2 hours after the GBM trigger,
with the r' and i' filters.

From initial quick-look images, we identify an possible
 uncatalogued object within the LAT error circle at the
following position:

RA(J2000) = 14:02:30.25
Dec(J2000)= -03:40:21.0

with an uncertainty of 2" and R~17 mag, calibrated against
nearby USNOB1 stars.
