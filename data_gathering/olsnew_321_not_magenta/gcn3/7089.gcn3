We observed the afterglow of GRB 071112C (Perri et al., GCN 7059) 
with the 152 cm Cassini Telescope located in Loiano under clear 
sky conditions (seeing approximately  1.8 arcsec).
We  obtained three 20 min Rc-band images 
starting on 2007 November 12.929 UT (mean time). 

In our co-added images we estimated the following magnitude 
by comparison with the NOMAD1 catalog: Rc= 21 +/- 0.2
This result is consistent with a power-law index = -0.8 as
reported by Burenin et al. (GCN7066) and Chen et al. (GCN 7083).


The co-added Rc image, in which the comparison stars are marked, has been
posted in our public directory from where it can be retrieved
