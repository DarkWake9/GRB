Swift Observatory Team:

At 08:54:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 181125A (trigger=873433).  Swift did not slew due to an
observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 268.413, -2.613, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 53m 39s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 36' 47"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:18 UT on 2019 January 31. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Sonbas (edasonbas AT yahoo.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
