E. Rol, P. O'Brien, N. Bannister (Leicester) report:
  
"The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope followed up robotically the GRB050716
detected by SWIFT (Rol et al. GCN 3623) 3.8 min after the GRB trigger
time. The automatic "detection mode" procedure did not detect any obvious
candidate up to about R=19.8 from 3 10-s images (mean epoch of 4.3 min
after the GRB), with FOV of 4.6'x4.6' centred on the BAT in-flight
location.
 
The limiting magnitude is automatically calculated with respect to the
USNOB1.0 'R2' values of the field objects.
 
Further observations are ongoing.
