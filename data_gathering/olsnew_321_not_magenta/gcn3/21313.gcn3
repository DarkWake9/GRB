Using the data set from T-240 to T+607 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170710A (trigger #761119)
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 21308).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 231.851, -38.523 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 27m 24.2s 
  Dec(J2000) = -38d 31' 22.2" 
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 22%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+37 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 32.6 +- 10.5 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.16 to T+36.91 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.91 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.4 +- 1.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.48 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
