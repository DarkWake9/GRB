P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:26:40.94 UT on April 16 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140416A (trigger 419304403/140416060).  
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is RA = 35.4, Dec = 43.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 
02h 21m 36s, 43d 54'), with an uncertainty of 1 
degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 
138 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several peaks with a duration
 (T90) of about 28.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10.0 s to T0+31.0s is
well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 78 +/- 2 keV, 
Alpha = -1.01 +/- 0.04 and Beta = -2.44 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.20 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+6.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 71 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
