Due to a typographical error, the RA of the source quoted
for GRB 090823 in GCN #9835 was incorrect by a large
amount. The correct BAT position was 128.711, 60.660 which
is equivalent to

     RA, Dec (J2000): 8:34:50.7, 60d 39' 36"

with an uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin (estimated 90%
containment, stat+sys).

I apologize for the error.
