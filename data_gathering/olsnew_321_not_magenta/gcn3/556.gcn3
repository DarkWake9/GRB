K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and M. Feroci,
on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed GRB000214 (GCN 551, 552).
Triangulation gives an annulus centered at RA(2000)=153.560,
Decl(2000)=-41.892, with radius 65.114 +/- 0.021 degrees
(3 sigma).  This annulus intersects the refined WFC error
circle to make an ~30 sq. arcmin. error box whose corners
are at:

     RA(2000)           DEC(2000)
18 h 55 m 14.39 s    -66 o 29 ' 35 "
18 h 53 m 34.70 s    -66 o 21 ' 33 "
18 h 54 m 57.30 s    -66 o 31 ' 31 "
18 h 53 m 19.47 s    -66 o 23 ' 37 "

It also intersects the NFI error circle, reducing its
area by a factor of about 2, and making it likely that
this is indeed the counterpart to GRB000214.

Further refinement to this annulus is possible.
