"Using the Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) 1.0m telescope operated by the
Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, we have imaged the
GRB071101 field (McBreen et al. GCN7030). The observation started at
UT 01:59 on Nov 02 (8 hours after the GRB).  These images obtained in
B,V,R,I with 300 sec exposure show no new source.  The upper limit
derived from USNO-B1.0 stars is 21th mag in R-band."

We acknowledge the help of the LOAO operators, J.H. Yoon, for this
observation.
