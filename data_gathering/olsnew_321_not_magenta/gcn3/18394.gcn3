Following our reports of Pan-STARRS observations of the field
of LIGO/Virgo G184098,  and identification/classification of transients
(GCN18362, GCN18372, also see Steele et al. GCN18371). We report
further imaging has been continuing in the localisation region of the
‘LIB_skymap’, pushing east south into the higher probability regions.
Eight transients have been discovered. All are likely supernovae/AGN
which are in the field but unrelated to the GW source. A summary is
given below and a sky map is being uploaded  to the GraceDB for
visualisation.

The mag is the discovery AB magnitude. The reported
redshift is the spectroscopic redshift of the apparent host
galaxy from SDSS DR12 or that from the transient. P15cek
is the variable core of SDSS J093641.05+101415.9 which has an
SDSS spectrum showing AGN/QSO characteristics.
The host of PS15cel has no spectroscopic redshift reported,
but from the data in hand,  appears likely to be a supernova.
