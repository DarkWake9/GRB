report on behalf of the One-Meter Two Hemisphere (1M2H) collaboration:

in the process of following up the localization region of LIGO/Virgo event S190720a (GCN 25138), we observed the following fields for 300s each in r-band with the 0.7-m Thacher telescope at the Thacher School Observatory. The localization region was provided by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration in the LALinference map of July 22 17:43:30. All Thacher observations were performed on UT 2019 Jul 23.  The approximate center of each image is noted in the table below, and the field of view is a 21 arcmin x 21 arcmin rectangle.  We note the approximate 3-sigma limiting magnitude of each image.

Comparing our images to PS1 r-band images of the same fields, we did not detect any transient sources.
