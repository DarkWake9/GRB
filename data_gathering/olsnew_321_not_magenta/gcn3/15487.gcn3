We report further analysis of the ground-detected Swift-BAT slew GRB 131110A
(Cummings and Palmer, GCN circ # 15483).  The best BAT position is
RA, Dec 69.268, -17.259 which is

RA (J2000)    04h 37m 4.4s
Dec (J2000)  -17d 15' 34"

with an estimated 90% containment radius of 0.8 arcmin.

The BAT mask-weighted lightcurve shows a single broad peak with a slow rise to a
plateau at T+25 seconds, lasting about 70 seconds, and a slow decay.  T90 is about
100 +- 10 seconds.

The average spectrum from T0 to T+90 (after which the source had a low mask coding
factor in BAT) is best fit by a simple power law function with a photon index of
1.61 +- 0.09.  The fluence from 15-150 keV during this interval was
(3.53 +- 0.10) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2/sec.  Errors are 90% confidence.

A Swift TOO has been approved with the observation number 20327, to be performed
11/15/2013.
