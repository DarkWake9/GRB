S. T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift Team:

      UVOT took a 100 s finding chart exposure of the field of the
possible GRB 080129 (Immler et al., GCN Circ. 7226) with the white
(160-650 nm) filter starting 3207 seconds after the BAT trigger.  No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products.  The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle.  The 3-sigma
upper limit at the centre of the BAT position is white ~= 18.5 on the
UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. 2008).  The 8'x8' region for the
list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle
and contains no uncatalogued sources.  This list of sources is typically
complete to about 18 mag.  This field is 1.42 degrees from the
Galactic place, and no correction has been made for the expected
Galactic extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 1.02.
