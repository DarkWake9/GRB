B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 14:37:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 131120A (trigger=578227).  Swift could not slew to the burst
due to a Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 278.921, -11.997 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 35m 41s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 59' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for image triggers, the
immediately-available BAT lightcurve does not show strong
variation. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:39 UT on 2014 February 13. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Maselli (maselli AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
