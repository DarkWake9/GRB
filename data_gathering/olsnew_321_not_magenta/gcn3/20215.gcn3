(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of 161129A  (Kocevski et al., GCN 20210)  with 
Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory. 
We obtained several images in R filter starting on 2016-11-29 (UT) 
12:51:12.  Within enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al. GCN 20211)  we 
detected  optical source which is absent in USNO-B1.0 but barely visible 
in DSS2 (red). At the moment we can not say anything about the source 
variability. The source might be a superposition of the afterglow and a 
host galaxy.  Preliminary photometry of the source  is following
