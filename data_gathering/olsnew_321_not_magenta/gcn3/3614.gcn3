D. Malesani (SISSA/ISAS), P. D'Avanzo (INAF, OABr), G.L. Israel, S. 
Piranomonte (INAF, OARm), G. Chincarini (Univ Milano-Bicocca), L. Stella 
(INAF, OARm), G. Tagliaferri (INAF, OABr), E. Depagne (ESO), report:

We observed the field of GRB 050714B with the ESO VLT-UT2 (Kueyen) 
equipped with the FORS1 instrument. The observing conditions were 
moderate, with a seeing of ~1.4 arcsec. Exposures were carried out in 
the R band, starting on 2005 Jul 14, 23:37 UT (56 min after the GRB).

Inspection of the XRT error circle (Levan et al., GCN 3613) shows a 
bright, single object not visible in the DSS at the approximate 
coordinates (error ~1"):

 alpha(J2000) = 11:18:47.8
 delta(J2000) = -15:32:52.6

Its magnitude is brighter than the DSS limit, so we suggest that this 
object is the afterglow of GRB 050714B.
