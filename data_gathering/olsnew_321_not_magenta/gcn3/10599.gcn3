report:

The long GRB 100414A, seen by Fermi/LAT (Takahashi et al., GCN 10594)
Fermi/GBM (Foley, GCN 10595), and Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al., GCN
10597) was also detected by Suzaku WAM so far.

Triangulation gives a Konus-WAM annulus centered at RA(2000)=223.490
(14h 53m 58s)  Dec(2000)=-18.645 (-18d 38' 42"), whose
radius is 41.329 ± 0.588 deg (3 sigma);
and a Konus-GBM annulus centered at RA(2000)=223.527 (14h 54m 06s)
Dec(2000)=-18.436 (-18d 26' 09"), whose radius is 41.123 ± 0.262  deg
(3 sigma).  These annuli are parallel and cannot be used to
define a small error box.  The Konus-GBM annulus is entirely contained
within the the Konus-WAM annulus in the region around the Fermi/LAT
localization.

The center of the LAT position (RA,Dec,Err = 191.59, 8.57, 0.18 deg)
is 0.377 deg from the center line of the annulus.

A figure of the triangulated localization can be seen at:

This localization may be refined with the arrival of data from more
distant spacecraft.

Swift is following up this localization using information from the IPN
triangulation and further processing from the Fermi LAT team.
