report:

The INTEGRAL error circle of GRB 040827 (GCN 2672) was observed by
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey). We made 17x100s R band images, starting at 17:30UT, 5:40 after the
burst. Due to bad seeing (2''), extremely large zenith distance (60--80
degrees), partially cloudy sky and very bright moon the combined image is
only slightly deeper than DSS2. We detected no new objects as compared to
DSS2 red plate.

We do not confirm optical transient reported by Lipunov et al. (GCN
2676). 

There is also nothing at the position of XMM X-ray source (GCN 2678) down to
the limit of our combined image, i.e. to approximately 20.5 mag. More exact
limit will be obtained after when our image will be calibrated
photometrically.
