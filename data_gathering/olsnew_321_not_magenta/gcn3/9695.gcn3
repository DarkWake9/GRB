Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the field of view towards
 the GRB 090715B (GCN 9668) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Jul. 20.14
UT. We clearly detect the GRB afterglow at the Swift UVOT afterglow
position (GCN 9668). The peak flux at the GRB afterglow position is
231+/-47 uJy.
