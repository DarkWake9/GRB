A. Maselli, M. De Pasquale (INAF-IASFPA) and E. Troja (NASA/GSFC/UMCP) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We report on further Swift XRT observations in the field of the 
FERMI/GBM-discovered GRB 140801A (Pelassa, GCN Circ. 16658). A new 
exposure of 2.0 ks has been obtained, 123 ks after the Fermi/GBM 
trigger. The X-ray counterpart reported by Maselli & De Pasquale (GCN 
Circ. 16661) is still detected at a count rate of 9.9 (+/-2.5) x 10^-3 
cts s^-1. This latest measurement corresponds to a decay slope of 0.8 
(+0.5, -0.4): thus we confirm that this source is the afterglow of GRB 
140801A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
