The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:20:35 UT on 18 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220118A (trigger 664222840.838306 / 220118764).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 191.4, Dec = 23.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 45m, 23d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 52.0 degrees.
