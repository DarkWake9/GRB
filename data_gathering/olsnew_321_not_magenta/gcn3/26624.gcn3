The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:39:26 UT on 1 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200101A (trigger 599603971.45143 / 200101861).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 257.4, Dec = -35.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 09m, -35d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 61.0 degrees.
