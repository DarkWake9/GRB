The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 20:12:46.60 UT on 2 July 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220702B (trigger 678485571 / 220702842).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 170.7, Dec = 46.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 22m, 46d 48'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 5.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65 degrees.
