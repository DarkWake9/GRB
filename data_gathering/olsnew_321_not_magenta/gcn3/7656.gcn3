Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080430 (trigger #310613)
(Guidorzi, et al., GCN Circ. 7647).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 165.331, 51.682 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 01m 19.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +51d 40' 55.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak starting at ~T-0.7 sec,
peaking at ~T+1.5 sec, and ending at ~T+60 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
16.2 +- 2.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.3 to T+21.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.73 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.70 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
