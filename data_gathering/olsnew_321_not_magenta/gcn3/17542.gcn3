S. Jeong (IAA-CSIC & SKKU), M. Jelinek, J. C. Tello (IAA-CSIC) and A. J.
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC & ISA-UMA), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

"The 60 cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope (Malaga, Spain) automatically
responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 150302A (Lien et al., GCN 17526).
The first exposure started at 05:43:54 UT (78s after the trigger) and a
sequence of 79 images was obtained (3s each, z filter). A median combined
image revealed no credible optical source detection neither at the
enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 17534) nor at the optical
counterpart position (Fynbo et al., GCN 17527) down to 18.5 mag (3 sigma
UL).
It is calibrated against the SDSS z-field."
