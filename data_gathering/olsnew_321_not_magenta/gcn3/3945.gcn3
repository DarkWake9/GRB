W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, report: 

"We remotely observed GRB 050908 (Swift Trigger #154112;
Goad et al. GCN GCN 3942) with the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic
Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory, and identified
a fading object at the position 

R. A.  =  01:21:50.75
DEC.   = -12:57:17.2 (J2000, 0.3" uncertainty)

which is probably the same object as reported by Torii (GCN 3943). 
The object is at magnitude about 20.1 (unfiltered; calibrated
via the USNO-B1.0 catalog) in a 600 s unfiltered image started at
06:36:24 UT, 3233s after the bust.
