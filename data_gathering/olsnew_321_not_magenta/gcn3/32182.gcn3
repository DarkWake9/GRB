The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:30:54 UT on 9 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220609A (trigger 676431059.34879 / 220609063).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 225.5, Dec = -33.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 01m, -33d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100.0 degrees.
