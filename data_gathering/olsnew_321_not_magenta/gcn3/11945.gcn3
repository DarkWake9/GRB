Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110420A (trigger #451757)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 11941).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 2.164, -37.877 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 08m 39.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 52' 35.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 15%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with some structure
starting at ~T-15 sec, peaking at ~T+8 sec, and ending at ~T+35 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 11.8 +- 0.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+16.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.30 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+8.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 14.0 +- 0.9 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
