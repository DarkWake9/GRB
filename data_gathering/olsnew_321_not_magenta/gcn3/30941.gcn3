The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:59:31 UT on 19 Oct 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211019A (trigger 656315976.19434 / 211019250).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 109.2, Dec = -37.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 16m, -37d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64.0 degrees.
