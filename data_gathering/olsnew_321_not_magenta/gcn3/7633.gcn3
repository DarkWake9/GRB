B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), F. Yuan (U Mich), W. Rujopakarn 
(Steward), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
080420 (Swift trigger 309665; Vetere, L. et al., GCN 7632) a possible
short burst, producing images beginning 8.1 s after the GCN notice time.
An automated response took the first image at 04:13:10.2 UT, 23.0 s after
the burst, under fair conditions.  These observations were affected by the
Full Moon 75 degrees away. We took 10 5-sec, and 60 20-sec exposures.
These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging
is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle; the field is not crowded. Individual 
images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.1-17.1; we set the 
following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
