P. A. Price, J. Meltzer, B. Stalder, S. G. Djorgovski, and T. J. Galama,
on behalf of a large collaboration, report:

"In addition to the gunn-r observations reported in GCN #892, we also observed
the error box of GRB 001120 in gunn-i with 6 x 500s pointings on 2000 Nov 22.18
and Nov 24.18.  Our images cover the entire error box.  We do not find any
optical transient candidate from these observations, either from comparison
with the DPOSS, or from subtraction of the two epochs.  The magnitude limit
is uncertain, but estimated to be i ~ 22.5 mag at each epoch.  This argues
against the hypothesis that an optical afterglow was undetected due to
either a high redshift (z > 5) or a modest obscuration by dust.
