G. Kosugi, N. Kawai, K. Aoki, T. Hattori, K. Ohta, and T. Yamada
report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team:

"We have observed the Swift/XRT position of GRB 050412 reported by
Mangano et al.(GCN #3253) in Rc-band with FOCAS on the Subaru 8.2m
telescope atop Mauna Kea on the night of Apr.12.  We obtained one 60s
image at 08:03 UT (2.3 hr after the event) and three 600s images at
12:55 UT (7.2 hr after the event).

Our first image shows no afterglow candidates inside the XRT error
circle (5" in radius) down to Rc=24.9 (3-sigma).  A galaxy 9" SW from
the XRT position first mentioned by Jensen et al. (GCN #3243) is found
to be Rc=22.6 +/- 0.1.

Our second data set revealed an object almost at the center of the XRT
error circle with the magnitude of Rc=26.0 +/- 0.5.  Due to the
marginal detection, we cannot determine whether it is a point source
or a galaxy."
