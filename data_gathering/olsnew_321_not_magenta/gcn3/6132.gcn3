Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070223 (trigger #261664)
(Vetere, et al., GCN Circ. 6125).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 153.453, 43.132 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 10h 13m 48.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 43d 07' 55.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 82%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve starts at ~T-20 sec and then rises
to two main peaks at T+15 and T+35 sec with a long decaying profile
out to T+150 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 89 +- 2 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.4 to T+98.5 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.87 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.1 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+34.35 sec
in the 15-150 keV band is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.

The initial series of GCN Notices were delayed by ~460 sec because
the trigger occurred during a Malindi telemetry downlink pass
when the TDRSS messages are buffered on-board until the transmitter
becomes available.
