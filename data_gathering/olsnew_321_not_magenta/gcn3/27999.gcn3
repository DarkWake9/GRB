We observed the field of GRB 200613A (Fermi GBM team, GCN #27926; 
Bissaldi et al., GCN #27930; Ohno et al., GCN #27931; Evans, GCN #27932) 
with the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOSC) mounted 
on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope located at IAO, Hanle, India. 
Observations started on 2020-06-19 at 15:20:43 UT and we obtained 3 
frames, each of 300 sec in the Bessell R-band filter under moderate sky 
conditions.

The afterglow (Kann et al., GCN #27935; Pozanenko et al., GCN #27937; 
Zhu et al., GCN #27943; Marshall, GCN #27944; Liu et al., GCN #27949; 
Belkin et al., GCN #27958; GCN #27978; GCN #27983; Fu et al., GCN 
#27971; Moskvitin et al., GCN #27982; Izzo, GCN #27998) is clearly 
visible in the stacked image. We measure a preliminary magnitude of R = 
20.59 +/- 0.26 mag calibrated against the USNO-A2.0 catalogue stars. The 
host contamination has not been removed in the analysis.

We thank the observing staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the 
observations.
