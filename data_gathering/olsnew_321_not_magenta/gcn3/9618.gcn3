on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:
 
Using the data set from T-239 to T+454 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report from further analysis that BAT trigger 356516 (Ukwatta et al, Circ 9615)
is not a GRB.

The image shows a 3.1 sigma bump and the mask-weighted lightcurve shows
a hint of positive flux from T_zero to ~T+70 sec.  While we can not
rule out that this is real astrophysical emission, we think it very unlikely.
If the source is real, it is at RA,Dec = 318.294,62.487 deg
with an uncertainty of 6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding is 95%.
