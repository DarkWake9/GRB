We observed the field of the Swift GRB 141109A  (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 
17037) with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory. 
Observations were performed under mean seeing (FWHM) of 2.4". We 
obtained several unfiltered images on Nov. 10 starting on (UT) 01:05:04. 
  At the position reported in (Covino, GCN 16932) we marginally 
detected (S/N =2) the afterglow of GRB 141109A  (Covino, GCN 16932; Xu 
et al., GCN 17040; Graham et al., GCN 17041). Preliminary photometry is 
following:

The photometry is based on several SDSS-DR9 stars R magnitudes 
transformed from SDSS-DR9 based on Lupton transformations:
