C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

Swift-BAT detected GRB 210217A at 23:25:42 UT (GCN 29521). There was no
Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event.

An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard
triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM identified a high reliability transient 
consistent in both time and location with the Swift BAT event.

The GBM targeted search [1], the most sensitive, coherent search for
GRB-like signals also identified a transient most significantly on the 1.024 s
timescale, with a log likelihood ratio of 72 and a location consistent with
the Swift BAT event. The GBM targeted search event was found with the highest
significance with a "normal" spectrum (Band function with
Epeak = 230 keV, alpha = -1.0, beta = -2.3) for a GRB.
