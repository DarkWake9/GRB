J.A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), B.
Mingo (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), V. D'Elia (ASDC),
A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 170117A, collecting 2.9 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+86.3 ks and T0+116.0 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 296
arcsec of the Swift/BAT position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field
ranges from ~0.003 to ~0.004 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV
observed flux of 1.3e-13 to 1.8e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical
GRB spectrum).

An uncatalogued was detected, however this was too far from the GRB
position to be the afterglow.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020728.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
