collaborations

We observed the field of the radio transient found in ASKAP follow-up
(GCN #25445) of the localization region of LIGO/Virgo S190814bv (GCN
#25324) with the Wide field Infrared Camera (WIRC; Wilson et al. 2003)
on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. We obtained a series of dithered
exposures of the field in J band for a total exposure time of 10
minutes. The data were reduced and stacked using a custom data
reduction pipeline for WIRC (De et al. in prep). No source is detected
at the reported location down to a 5 sigma limiting magnitude of 21.5
AB mag.
