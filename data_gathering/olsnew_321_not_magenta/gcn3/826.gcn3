GRB000926 - Optical observations

The optical counterpart of GRB000926 has been observed using the
CFH12K CCD mosaic camera at the prime focus of the 3.6-m CFH
Telescope for the third night.

One 600s exposure has been obtained with an excellent seeing
(0.5"). Using the new R magnitude of 17.06 by Halpern et al. 
(GCN #824) for the reference star, the three R magnitudes of
the GRB for our observations are:


Sept. 29.3075  R = 21.19 +/- 0.05 
Sept. 30.3075  R = 22.15 +/- 0.06 
Oct.  01.2593  R = 22.57 +/- 0.08

The last observation by Fynbo et al. (GCN #825) and this new
CFHT data point sugest that the GRB is no longer on the decay
reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN #820), Veillet (GCN #823) and
Halpern et al. (GCN #824). We could see a flare out as 
suggested by Dar in a private communication (see also 
astro-ph/0008474), though more observations would definitely 
be welcome at this stage...

D. Kocevski, D. Donovan and G. Luppino are acknowledged for their
help in this observation.
