The long-duration GRB 160119A (Swift-BAT trigger #671014:
Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 18893, Stamatikos, et al.,
GCN Circ. 18899) was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a weak count rate increase
starting from ~T0(BAT)+9 s. The main phase of the event
consists of a single peak from ~T0(BAT)+120 s to ~T0(BAT)+175 s.
As calculated from the Bayesian block division,
the total duration of the burst is ~215 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB160119A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
1.68(-0.18,+0.19)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+144.3 s, of 6.39(-0.85,+0.89)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Modelling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(measured from ~T0(BAT)+8.9 s to ~T0(BAT)+223.8 s)
by the cutoff power law yields the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -1.73(-0.12,+0.15),
and the peak energy Ep = 189(-53,+231) keV.

Modelling the 3-channel spectrum near the peak count rate
(from ~T0(BAT)+138.4 s to ~T0(BAT)+150.2 s)
by the cutoff power law yields the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -1.16(-0.13,+0.15),
and the peak energy Ep = 187(-25,+34) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
