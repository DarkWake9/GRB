NUMBER:  5427
SUBJECT: VLA Upper Limit on Outburst of SGR 1806-20

E. Fomalont, B. Clark, and J. Ulvestad report on behalf of NRAO:

We have used the NRAO Very Large Array in its B configuration on
behalf of the community for an observation of SGR 1806-20, the
apparent source of GRB 060806 (GCN 5416, Hurley et al. 2006; GCN
5419, Hurley et al. 2006).  The observation epoch was 2006AUG09
at 03:15 UT.  There was no significant detection of a new point
source at the nominal J2000 position of 18:08:39.4, -20:24:39.8
(Taylor et al. 2005, ApJL, 634, L93).  The approximate 5-sigma
upper limits for a new point source are as follows:

1.42 GHz: < 2.0 mJy (limited by confusion)
8.46 GHz: < 0.3 mJy
22.46 GHz: < 1.7 mJy

The raw data will appear in the VLA archive at
http://www.nrao.edu/archive/ at approximately 0:00:00 UT on 2006AUG10,
and are freely available to the community for further processing and
analysis.  An additional community observation is planned for
2006AUG10 to check for a later appearance of a new point source.
