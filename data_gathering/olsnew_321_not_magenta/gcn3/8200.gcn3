E. Troja (INAF-IASFPA) and L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 07:12:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an excess (trigger=324116).  Swift slewed immediately to the position. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 280.572, -11.411 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 42m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 24' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). This position is consistent with the known
transient SWIFT J1842.5-1124 (Krimm et al. ATEL #1610 and GCN #8199).  
The XRT position is consistent with the previously reported 
position to within 4.6 arcsec. Thus, this trigger is the known 
source and not a GRB.  This is the second trigger on this source tonight. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
