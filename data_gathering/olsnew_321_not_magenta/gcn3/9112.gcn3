V.Chaplin (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor  
Team:

“On 07 April 2009 at 18:43:55.25 UT, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor  
(GBM)
triggered and located a weak source (trigger 260822637 / 090407781).
The most likely nature of the source is a weak GRB.

The GBM lightcurve consists of a weak pulse of about 3 seconds  
starting from
T0-3, and appears to only have emission between 10-100keV.
Since the source is very weak, it is not possible to find a reliable
on-ground calculated location and to perform any spectral analysis."
