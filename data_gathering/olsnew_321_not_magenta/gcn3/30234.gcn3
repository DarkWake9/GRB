A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), B. Sbarufatti (PSU),
D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U.
Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T.
Sbarrato (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO detected burst GRB 210605B (James DeLaunay et al. GCN
Circ. 30130). The observations now extend from T0+74.3 ks to T0+734.1
ks. 

Of the sources reported by D'Ai et al. (GCN Circ. 30146), "Source 1" is
fading with 2.5 sigma significance and thus is believed to be the GRB
afterglow.  The position of this source is RA, Dec=15.7456, -6.4290
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 01:02:58.95
Dec(J2000): -06:25:44.3

with an uncertainty of 5.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 2.4 arcmin from the Swift/BAT position. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.8 (+0.7, -0.4).
