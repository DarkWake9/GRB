V. D'Elia (ASDC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
C. Pagani (U Leicester) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 11:15:25 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130529A (trigger=556930).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 24.259, -64.138, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 37m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 08' 17"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time
TDRSS lightcurve does not show anything significant. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:17:18.0 UT, 112.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 24.2798, -64.1493 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +01h 37m 7.15s
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 08' 57.5"
with an uncertainty of 5.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 52 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.24e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 122 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
Data from the list of sources generated on-board are not available at this
time. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.02. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
