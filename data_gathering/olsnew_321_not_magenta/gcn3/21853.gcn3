P. Veres (UAH) and F. Berlato (MPE) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The recent increased Solar activity resulted in an increased number of Fermi
GBM triggers. The following triggers, classified by GBM flight software as
GRBs, were actually caused by Solar activity:

    526522492 / 170908010
    526530609 / 170908104
    526568266 / 170908540
    526574275 / 170908610

During the Solar activity we will not issue individual corrections for
mis-classified triggers."
