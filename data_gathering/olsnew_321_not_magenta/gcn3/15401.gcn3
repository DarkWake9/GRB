report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 23:20:48.58 UT on 29 October 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 131029A (trigger 404781651 / 131029973), 
which was also detected by Fermi/LAT (Racusin et al. 2013, GCN 15399). 
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position. 
At the time of triggering the angle from the Fermi LAT boresight was
59 degrees. 

The GBM light curve consists of a double peaked pulse 
with a duration (T90) of about 105 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.072 s to T0+100.353 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 230 +/- 20 keV,
alpha = -1.02 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.1 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.0 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
