Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward the
GRB 090618 (GCN 9512) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 June 19.33 UT.
We observed the radio afterglow of the GRB at P60 optical afterglow
position reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 9513). The GRB radio afterglow
flux density is 383+/-47 uJy. Further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
