Martin Jelinek, Alberto J. Castro-Tirado and Javier Gorosabel
(IAA-CSIC Granada) on behalf of a larger collaboration
report:

"The 0.3m  BOOTES-1B robotic telescope located in Huelva
(Spain), observed the optical afterglow of GRB 121024A
(Pagani et al., GCNC 13886; Klotz et al., GCNC 13887). 
The observations started 40 minutes after the GRB trigger. 
The sum of 20 minutes of unfiltered images with a mean
integration time 54 minutes after the GRB shows the OT 
with magnitude roughly 18.2+-0.5."
