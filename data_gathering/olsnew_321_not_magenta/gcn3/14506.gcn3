report:

We again observed the field of GRB 130427A (Maselli, et al., GCN 14448)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 29.14 to 2013/04 29.27 UTC
(43.64 to 46.60 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.02
hours exposure in the r' and i' bands and 1.57 hours exposure in the Z, Y,
J, and H bands.

We continue to detect the optical/NIR afterglow (Elenin et al; GCN 14450)
in all bands.  In comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we find:

  r'    18.90 +/- 0.01
  i'    18.67 +/- 0.01
  Z     18.38 +/- 0.03
  Y     18.19 +/- 0.02
  J     18.29 +/- 0.02
  H     18.01 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Uncertaints are 1-sigma.  The
source has faded by about 1 magnitude in all bands as compared to our
measurements on the previous night (Butler et al. 2013; GCN 14483).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
