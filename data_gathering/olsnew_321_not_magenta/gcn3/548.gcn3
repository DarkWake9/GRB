Michael Garcia (Chandra X-ray Center), 
Gordon Garmire (Penn State), Luigi Piro (IAS/CNR) report:

There is a possible error in the position of the x-ray afterglow
of GRB000210 as reported in GCN544.  The error is approximately
8 arcsec in the spacecraft Z direction, which in this case is 
RA.  The true position may be 8 arcsec to the East, or:

RA=01:59:15.5, DEC = -40:39:33.2 (J2000)

We note that U0450_00688875, ra= 01 59 29.84 dec=-40 43 26.0, 
rmag=15.2 would be correctly located by Chandra if this error is included.
Note that this new position agrees with the optical source mentioned
in GCN 545 and 547.
