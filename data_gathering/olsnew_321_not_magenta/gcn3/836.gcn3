A Chandra X-ray Observatory TOO observation of the afterglow from GRB000926
began September 29.67375 and ended on 29.85125, but with a total good time
of observation of 9979s.  The source position determined by CXO is:

RA(2000)=17h 04m 09.6s  Decl. (2000)= +51 47' 8.6"

with an uncertainty of ~2", consistant with the optical position
by Gorosabel et al.  GCN 803, Dall et al. GCN 804, Halpern et al. GCN 806.

The average flux of the source is (3.08+/-.017) 10^-2 cts/s, corresponding to a
flux F(1.6-10 keV)=(9.4+/-0.95)10^-14 erg/cm2/s.
The spectrum is found to fit a powerlaw with powerlaw index =(1.76+/-0.2)
consistant with the slope of Piro et al. GCN 832, and the absorption
by our Galaxy (NH=2.7 10^20 cm-2).

This very large decrease in flux in such a short time is unprecedented,
decreasing by a factor of ~3 in only ~12 hours from the BeppoSAX measurement!
To obtain a better measure of the slope with time for a law of the
form F=c(T-T0)^d_X with T0=26.99 will require a more refined analysis,
since taking average values leads to a slope of -5!
