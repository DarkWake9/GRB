report on behalf of the TAROT network and GRANDMA collaborations:

We performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo event S190814bv
(GCN #25324) with the TAROT-Reunion (Les Makes Observatory,
La Reunion Island, France) telescope operating in clear filter.

The observations started on 08/14/19 21:41:19 UTC which corresponds
approximately to 31 minutes after the GW trigger time.

We performed the following tiled observations :

TStart and TEnd refer respectively to the time of the first and last
exposure for a given tile. Observations are not necessarily continuous
in this interval.

The Probability refers to the 2D spatial
probability of the GW skymap enclosed in a given tile. Each tile is
4.2x4.2 degrees. These observations cover about 89% of the cumulative
probability of the LALInference skymap with HLV (posted at Aug 15,
2019 09:07:19 UTC)

The typical limiting magnitude is 16.0 for a 60.0 s exposure due to
bad conditions of observations.

No serious transient candidates were found during our low latency
analysis.

The coverage map is available at:
https://grandma-owncloud.lal.in2p3.fr/index.php/s/0aSCYiO1XqzHJkx

Further analysis of the field (ra:13.500,dec:-24.5454) observed 64
min after the GW trigger time covering 76% of the LALInference skymap
has been performed.

No sources were found giving an upper limit at 16 mag for
a possible optical counterpart.

We have also found no source (3 sigma) at locations of desgw-190814j,
desgw-190814m, desgw-190814o (GCN #25425), DG19hqpgc, DG19tzyhc,

(GCN #25356), desgw-190814a (GCN #25336), desgw-190814q (GN #25438).
