"We have observed the INTEGRAL error box of GRB 031203 (Gotz et al. GCN #2459)
with the Danish 1.5-m telescope at La Silla. We have obtained ~50 min I-band
exposures at five epochs between Dec 5.6 and Dec 13.6 UT in good seeing
conditions (~ 0.8"). We have performed both SExtractor photometry and
PSF-matched subtraction of the galaxy (Hsia et al. GCN #2470; Prochaska
et al. GCN #2475) coincident with the VLA radio (Frail GCN #2473; Soderberg
et al. GCN #2483) and XMM-Newton X-ray (Santos-Lleo & Calderon GCN #2464;
Rodriguez-Pascual et al. GCN #2474; Tedds et al. GCN #2490) error circles.
We find no evidence for significant variability above a level of 0.02 mag.
The PSF-matched subtraction did not reveal significant residuals either. We
therefore cannot confirm the reported variability (Bailyn et al. GCN #2486).
Assuming a foreground reddening of A_I = 2.01 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998),
these data points rule out a contribution from a SN1998bw-like supernova
redshifted to z = 0.105. There is still room for a fainter supernova, a more
distant supernova, or a supernova with a different lightcurve shape.
Continued monitoring at other observatories would help to constrain these
parameters. The monitoring has ended at the Danish 1.5-m telescope."
