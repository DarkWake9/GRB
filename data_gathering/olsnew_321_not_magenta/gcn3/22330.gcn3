WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 180113A (Ukwatta et al.,
GCN 22325) starting at 03:57:49 UT, 70 minutes after the burst,
and lasted for about 1.5 hours. Observations were performed with
a sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the
exposure time was 60 s per image. The field is relative crowded,
after a preliminay analysis using the subtraction method, we do
not detect any optical afterglow candidate within the Swift-BAT
error circle (Ukwatta et al., GCN 22325). The typical limiting
magnitude of our single clear image is about 19.5 mag calibrated
to the APASS catalog.
