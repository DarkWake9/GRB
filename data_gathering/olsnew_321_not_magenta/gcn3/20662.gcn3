(PSU), A. Cholden-Brown (PSU), S. J. LaPorte (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the IPN-detected
burst GRB 170209A (Roberts et al. GCN Circ. 20652), collecting 5.0 ks
of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+134.5 ks and T0+153.7 ks. 


No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 16
arcsec of the MASTER-OAFA position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the
field ranges from ~0.002 to ~0.005 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10
keV observed flux of 8.6e-14 to 2.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a
typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020739.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
