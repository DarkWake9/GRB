report on behalf of the Fermi GBM team:


“We have searched the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for a

gamma-ray counterpart to IceCube-190104A (GCN 23605). The

closest onboard trigger occurred approximately 16 hours after the

neutrino event time and was identified as a terrestrial gamma-ray

flash unassociated with the neutrino. The ground-based untargeted

search of GBM data did not find any significant candidates within

+/- 1 hour of the event time. The targeted search ([1],[2]) was also

run +/- 30 s around the event time, and no significant candidates

were found. Upper limits on persistent emission using the Earth

Occultation technique [3] will be forthcoming.”
