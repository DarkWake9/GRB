At 06:09:55 2-April-2005, UT Swift-BAT triggered on a marginal event
(trigger=113225) which has been reported as GRB 050402 (GCNs 3167, 3168,
3169, 3170).  The BAT team believes that the automated notice sent out earlier
is likely consistent with a noise fluctuation, but we can not absolutely
rule out that it was due to a very soft, weak GRB.  The reasons which make
this a questionable detection are: (a) detected only in the 15-25 keV band,
(b) the image significance is very marginal, and (c) the noise in the
detector array is slightly elevated during this interval (thus increasing
the chance coincidence of a rate fluctuation and an image-domain fluctuation).
