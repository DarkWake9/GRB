The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

An update is available regarding the gravitational-wave event candidate
G184098, identified on 2015-09-14. Analysis of this event is still in
progress. The preliminary waveform reconstruction (if it is a real
gravitational-wave event) appears consistent with expectations for a
binary black hole coalescence.
