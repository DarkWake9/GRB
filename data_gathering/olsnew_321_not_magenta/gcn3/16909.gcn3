on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 09:12:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 141015A (trigger=615399).  Swift did not slew because of Moon constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 87.507, +18.316 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 50m 02s
   Dec(J2000) = +18d 18' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:56 UT on 2014 October 15. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (eleonora.troja AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
