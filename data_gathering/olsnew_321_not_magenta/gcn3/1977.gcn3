TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1977

P.A. Price and B.A. Peterson (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 030328 with the 40-inch telescope at
Siding Spring Observatory + Wide-Field Imager in R-band.  From two
un-flattened frames taken at Mar 28.54 and 28.63, we derive a power-law
decay:
	R/mag ~ 21.5 + 2.6 log(t/days)
based on assuming that the star at J2000 coordinates 12:10:50.7 -9:21:00
(Star B in GCN #1975) is R ~ 16.1 (as in USNO A2.0).

The corresponding decay index is alpha = 1.0 +/- 0.1.
