GRB 030329: wide-field photograph by R. Tamura 1 hr after the burst

T. Kato (Kyoto U), R. Tamura and T. Inone (Akashi Municipal Planetarium)
report:

   Ryuichi Tamura (Japanese amateur astronomer) incidentally took
wide-field photographs around the afterglow of GRB 030329 one hour
after the burst.  The photographs were taken at two epochs covering
12:28-12:35 UT (starting at 51 min after the burst) and 12:35-12:42 UT.
No obvious optical afterglow was detected on these images.
A quick look of the first image has yielded an upper limit of
about 8.5 mag.  Further analysis of the images is in progress.

   The enlarged image around the GRB is placed at:
