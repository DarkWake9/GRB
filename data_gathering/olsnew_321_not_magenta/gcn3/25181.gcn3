The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:30:36 UT on 28 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190728A (trigger 585988241.852436 / 190728271).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 356.7, Dec = 5.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 46m, 5d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 85.0 degrees.
