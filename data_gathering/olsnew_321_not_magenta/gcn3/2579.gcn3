report:

At 09:54:35.69 UTC (35675.69s UT) on 2004 April 23, the FREGATE, WXM, 
and SXC instruments on HETE detected trigger H3175, a long GRB.

The burst triggered in the FREGATE 30-400 keV band.  The flight 
localization by WXM was not distributed automatically, due to the low 
image S/N in the WXM Y-camera.

Ground analysis confirmed that the burst was detected and localizable 
with the WXM X camera, but was out of the field-of-view of the WXM 
Y-camera. The burst was also in the SXC field-of-view. Since the 
trigger time occurred in orbit twilight, scattered sunlight still 
contaminated a major portion of  SXC CCD area. Nonetheless, an SXC 
X-location, but not a Y-location, was derived from the uncontaminated 
CCD area. Consequently it has been possible to derive an 11-degree by 
3-arcminute 1-dimensional error box, whose long dimension is 
constrained by the relative count rates observed on the wires of the 
WXM X detector.

The localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle whose 
corners lie at J2000 coordinates:

R.A. = +15h 09m 46.6s, Dec. = -30d 18' 36"
R.A. = +15h 03m 54.6s, Dec. = -19d 15' 54"
R.A. = +15h 03m 42.0s, Dec. = -19d 16' 27"
R.A. = +15h 09m 33.4s, Dec. = -30d 19' 30"

The T90 duration of the burst was 30s in the FREGATE 30-400 keV 
energy band.  The fluence of the burst was 6E-06 erg cm^-2 in the 
25-100 keV band, and the peak flux was 6E-8 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 
8-30 keV band.
