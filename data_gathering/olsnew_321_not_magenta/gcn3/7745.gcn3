Adria C. Updike, Ginger Bryngelson, and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We re-imaged the field of GRB 080514B (Hurley et al., GCN 7715) with the
KPNO 4m + NEWFIRM under good weather conditions.  We obtained 15 minutes
in the J and H bands approximately 48 hours after the trigger.  In stacked
images, we marginally detect the afterglow (Postigo et al., GCN 7719) at J
= 20.7 +/- 0.3 (calibrated to the 2MASS catalog).  We do not detect the
afterglow in the H band with a limiting magnitude of 20.2.
