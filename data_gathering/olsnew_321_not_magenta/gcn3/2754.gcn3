T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

A soft short GRB040924 (=H3564, GCN 2735) was detected by Konus-Wind
at 11.52.15.280 UT and Helicon-Coronas-F at 11:52:12.691 UT.
It had a duration of approximately 1.5s in the 20-300 keV band.

As observed by Konus-Wind it had
a 20-500 keV fluence of (2.73 +/- 0.12)E-6 erg/cm2,
a 20-500 keV peak flux (3.33 +/- 0.35)E-6 erg/cm2 s over 0.064 s,
and Epeak of the time-integrated spectrum of 67 +/- 6 keV.

We have triangulated it to an annulus:
RA(2000) = 339.625 deg,
Decl(2000) = -5.584 deg,
Radius = 56.049 +/- 1.038 degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus encompasses the HETE WXM error circle reported in GCN 2735.
The center of the annulus passes 0.29 deg (0.84 sigma) from the center
of HETE error circle and 0.25 deg (0.7 sigma) from the position of
the OT given by Fox and Moon (GCN 2734).
