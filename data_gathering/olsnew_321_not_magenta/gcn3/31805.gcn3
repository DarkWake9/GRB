Dimple, Rahul Gupta, Ankur Ghosh, Naveen Dukiya, Amit Kumar, Amit Ror, Amar
Aryan, Kiran Wani, Kuntal Misra, and S. B. Pandey (ARIES) report:


We observed the fast and red optical transient ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc
discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility (Andreoni et al., GCN 31590)
using 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) located at Devasthal
observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences
(ARIES), India. The observations were carried out at multiple epochs. Here,
we report our last night's observations, which started on 22-03 28
at 19:32:05 UT~ 45.4 days after the first detection by the ZTF. We have
taken multiple frames having an exposure time of 120 sec in the R filter.
We stacked the images after the alignment. We detected ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc
(Andreoni et al., GCN 31590; Pankov et al., GCNs 31593, 31625, 31652, 31798;
Perley, GCN 31594; Kumar et al., GCN 31597; Lipunov et al., GCN 31600; Tanvir
et al., GCN 31602; Lundquist et al., GCN 31612; Kann et al., GCN 31626; Yao
et al., GCN 31641; Freeburn et al., GCN 31647; and Cenko et al., GCN 31729) in
our stacked image. The estimated preliminary magnitude is following:

Date Start_UT T_start-T0 (days) Filter  Exp time (sec)       magnitude
==============================================================
2022-03-28 19:32   ~45.4           R        120 sec*60            22.04 +/-
0.10


The magnitude is not corrected for the Galactic extinction in the direction
of the burst. Photometric calibration is performed using the standard stars
from the USNO-B1.0 catalog.
