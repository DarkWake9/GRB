We report observations of the localisation region of S190814bv (LVC,
GCN 25324) with the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) on 2019-08-16 at
a central frequency
of 943 MHz with a bandwidth of 288 MHz.

We have observed a single 30 sq. deg. field centered on
    RA = 00:50:37.5
    Dec = -25:16:57.4
which covers approximately 85% of the sky localisation from the
LALInference skymap (GCN 25333),
with a median rms of 34 uJy.

We have searched for radio emission within 5 arcseconds of the
location of the 124 optical transients
reported on the Transient Name Server by the DECam-GROWTH and DESGW
teams between 2019-08-16 and 2019-08-22
as at 2019-08-22 03:00 UTC. We report coincident compact radio
emission at the location of 14 of them:

We have also performed a preliminary search for transients using TraP
(Swinbank et al. 2015) comparing this
observation to the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS, [1]) at a
detection threshold of 0.95 mJy, corresponding
to 5 times the lowest rms of the RACS image. We find one candidate
transient located at
    RA = 00:54:34.6 +/- 0.02 arcsec
    Dec = -28:02:35.3 +/- 0.01 arcsec
which we note is outside the 95% confidence region of S190814bv. We
measure a flux density of 3.4 mJy in this
observation and a local rms noise of 0.25 mJy in the 888 MHz RACS
image observed on 2019-04-26. We measured an
integrated flux density of 0.74 mJy in the RACS image using TraP. We
also note that there is a radio source
coincident with this location in the image from the Very Large Array
Sky Survey (VLASS) observed on 2019-06-29
with a flux density of ~1.6 mJy at 3 GHz.

We conducted follow-up of this source with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) on 2019-08-21 with two
2048 MHz bands centered on 5.5 and 9 GHz. We measure preliminary flux
densities of 2.88 +/- 0.03 mJy and
2.93 +/- 0.02 mJy at 5.5 and 9 GHz, with respective in-band spectral
indices of +0.17 and -0.37.

Combining the near-contemporaneous ATCA and ASKAP measurements we find
a flat spectral index. Based on these
observations this candidate is likely to be an unrelated AGN.

The ASKAP observation is publicly available on the CSIRO ASKAP Science
Data Archive [2] under Scheduling Block ID 9602.

Further analysis of this ASKAP observation is ongoing and further
epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
