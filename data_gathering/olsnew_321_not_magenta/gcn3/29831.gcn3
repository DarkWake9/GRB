The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:10:28 UT on 19 Apr 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210419B (trigger 640559433.454802 / 210419882).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 307.1, Dec = -0.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 28m, 0d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
