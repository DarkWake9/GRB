Using the data set from T-239 to T+691 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090929 (trigger
#371050) (Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 9963).  The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA, Dec = 117.712, -0.645 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  07h 50m 50.9s
    Dec(J2000) = -00d 38' 41.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 63%.

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows many peaks interspersed with
intervals with no detected flux, from T-10 to T+380 sec when the source
left the coded field of view due to a observing constraint. There may
have been small and/or low-energy peaks beyond this time.  The largest
peak was at about T+30 to T+40 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) was 360 +- 20 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.8 to T+371.0 sec is best fit by a
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.85 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
5.9 +- 0.3 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+30.67 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 3.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
