The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 04:59:44 UT on 6 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200506B (trigger 610433989.715966 / 200506208).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 82.2, Dec = -6.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 28m, -6d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102.0 degrees.
