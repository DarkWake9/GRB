A. Fruchter (STScI), J. Rhoads (ASU), C. Davis, A. Adamson (JAC)
report for a larger collaboration:

We obtained a second epoch of K-band observations of GRB 060814
at UKIRT beginining at August 16, 06:46 UT. The suggested IR
afterglow (GCN Circ 5455) is still detected and has faded by
0.4 +/- 0.1 mags, confirming its association with GRB 060814.

The afterglow decay is very slow, with alpha~0.25. This may
well represent a signficant contribution from an underlying
host galaxy (see GCN Circs 5456 & 5457).
