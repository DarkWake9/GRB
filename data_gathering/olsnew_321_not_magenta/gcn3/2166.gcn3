K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 62784 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 5 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  6.5E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl
(2000) = 153.657, +38.620 degrees, whose radius is 80.319 +/-0.038
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as this event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, it will not be possible to derive a small
error box for it.
