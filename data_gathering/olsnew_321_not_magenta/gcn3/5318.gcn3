MARGE collaboration:


The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS 3.63m telescope, located at  
the Maui Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, observed the optical  
counterpart to GRB 060708 (Swift trigger 217805, Moretti, et al, GCN  
5292). Over 160 10-s images were taken between 2006-07-08 12:33:14.19  
UT  (1035 s after the burst), and 14:16:21.78 UT (7222s after the  
burst), with low resolution (R~10) grating spectroscopy.  The OT is  
clearly detected in individual images, and fades during the  
observation.  The position of the OT is:

      00:31:13.85   -33:45:33.0    (J2000)

consistent with the UVOT position (Schady and Moretti, GCN 5296).  At  
12:33:14.19 UT, the OT is approximately 17.7 mag (R equivalent,  
relative to a nearby 14th magnitude USNO B1.0 star).  The low  
resolution grating on the ABC is designed to study the color  
evolution of the early afterglow.
