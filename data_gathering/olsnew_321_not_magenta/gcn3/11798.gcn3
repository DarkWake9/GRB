behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:14:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 110318A (trigger=449542).  Swift did not slew to the burst
because of the Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 338.274, -15.282, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 33m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 16' 55"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows two main peaks
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:00 UT on 2011 April 11. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (boris.sbarufatti AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
