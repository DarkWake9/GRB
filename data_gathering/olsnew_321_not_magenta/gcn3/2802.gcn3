"We have observed the field of GRB 041006 (Galassi et al., GCN #2770) 
at two epochs with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope using the 
MOSCA instrument (R-band). At the position of the afterglow (Costa et 
al., GCN #2735), we detect the following:

Date (UT 2004) | t_b+  | exptime     | Seeing |  mag.
------------------------------------------------------------
Oct. 06.96       10.8h   300s+3x600s   ~0.8"    R~20.5
Oct. 11.18      112.2h   5x600s        ~1.9"    R~23.6

The photometry is relative to the magnitude of a nearby star
as measured by Henden (GCN #2801). The source is clearly extended in 
the 2nd epoch image (although the seeing was poor), so the potential
host galaxy is most likely contributing most of the flux.

A section of the 2nd epoch image can be seen at
