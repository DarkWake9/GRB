on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 02:38:21.10 2005-03-23 UT Swift-BAT triggered on a bright outburst
from SGR1806-20.  There were two short peaks each ~0.4 sec
in duration, each with a peak count rate of ~160,000 counts/sec.
There was a smaller pre-trigger peak of ~30,000 counts/sec
at T-0.7 sec.  More than 99% of the emission is below 100 keV.
