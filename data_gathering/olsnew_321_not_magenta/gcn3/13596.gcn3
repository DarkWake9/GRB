on behalf of the Swift-BAT team report:

In the real-time GCN Notices, this was reported as a event from
IGR J16207-5129 (with a large angular separation (10 arcmin) and
low image_domain significance (5.88 sigma)).  Using the data set
from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report ground analysis of BAT trigger #529813.  The image 
significance has dropped to 3 sigma.  This trigger was caused
by noise while entering the SAA and had a chance spatial coincidence
with the IGR source.
