Hjorth (DARK, NBI) and Nial R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

Using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope, we have obtained a 10 min
spectrum (grism 300V) of the optical afterglow of GRB 080210 (Grupe et
al., GCN 7281).

The acquisition image shows the UVOT optical afterglow candidate to
have R = 18.8 on Feb 10.351 UT (0.597 hours after the GRB) using
photometric zeropoints from the ESO webpages. We also obtained an
R-band image at 1.65 hours after the GRB indicating a decay index of
0.76 +/- 0.04.

The spectrum is rich in absorption features, including Ly-alpha, Si II, 
C II, Si IV, C IV, Fe II and Al II, corresponding to a redshift of
z = 2.641. This is consistent with the redshift upper limit (z < 3.5)
reported by GROND (Kuepcue Yoldas et al., GCN 7283). There is also a
tentative detection of Ly-alpha in emission superimposed on the DLA
trough.

We thank the Paranal staff for excellent support, especially Paul
Lynam.
