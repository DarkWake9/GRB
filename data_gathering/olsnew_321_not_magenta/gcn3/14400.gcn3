S. Martin (ESO/ALMA), A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC) and G. Petitpas (SMA)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale et al., GCN 14377) with 
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at Mauna Kea (Hawai, USA) in submm wavelengths.
Observations consisted of 1.25 hr on target with an average time 6.5 UT on 19
April 2013 (11.5 hr after the burst). We used 6 antennas on compact configuration, 
under average weather conditions, with a precipitable water vapour of 2.5 mm or
an optical depth at 225 GHz of ~0.1. The central observing wavelength was 
340 GHZ.

On a preliminary reduction we do not detect any source consistent with the 
position of the GRB down to a 3-sigma limit of 14.5 mJy (r.m.s. 4.8mJy). This limit
is consistent with the 3 mm detection by CARMA (Perley, GCN 14387)

We acknowledge excellent support from the SMA staff.
