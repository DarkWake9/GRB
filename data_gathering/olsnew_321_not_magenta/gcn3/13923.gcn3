N. Gehrels, S. D. Barthelmy, F. E. Marshall (GSFC):

This is a notification that some of the computers at Goddard are going to be
pre-emptively taken down in preparation for the expected power outages
due to hurricane Sandy (starting at ~13:00 UT October 29, 2012, for an
unknown duration).  The Swift Quick-look data at the Swift Data Center and
archival data at the HEASARC will not be available.  Archival data at the
ASI Science Data Center and the UK Swift Science Centre will still be available.
GCN Notice and Circular distribution will not be affected, but the GCN web pages
will be offline. If, of course, there is an actual power outage, GCN Notice and
Circular distribution will stop.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
