D. Grupe (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT Team:

We have analyzed the first 2 orbits of Swift-XRT data obtained for GRB
080210 (Grupe et al. GCN Circ. 7281), totaling 78 s of Windowed Timing
(WT) data and 668 s of Photon Counting (PC) data.  The enhanced XRT
position is given in Evans et al. (GCN 7285).

In correction to GCN 7281, XRT started observing the burst 153s after the
trigger.
The X-ray light-curve shows a bright flare at the beginning of the 
observations
with an initial decay slope of 7.5+/-0.9 followed by a plateau phase 
starting at
290+/-20s after the burst with a decay slope of 0.76+/-0.07.

The WT data (158-232 s after burst) can be modeled as an absorbed 
power-law with
photon index of 2.85 ± 0.25 and a free-fit absorbing column of NH = 
(21.5 +4.8
-5.4)e20 cm^-2 which is in excess of the Galactic value (5.47e20 cm^-2, 
Dickey &
Lockman 1990). The PC mode data are consistent with this result.


Assuming the source continues to decay with the same decay index of 0.76,
we predict an XRT count rate of 0.03 counts/s at T+24 hours, which
corresponds to an 0.3-10.0 keV observed flux of 8.3e-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
