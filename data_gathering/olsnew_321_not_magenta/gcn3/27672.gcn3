A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf
of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 12:56:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR1806-20 (trigger=968731).  Swift did not slew to the source because
the merit value has been set low on this source.  The BAT on-board calculated
location is RA, Dec 272.131, -20.398, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 08m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 23' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike structure
with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

We plan shortly to execute a 2ks TOO observation with Swift in order to determine
the flux state of this SGR.
