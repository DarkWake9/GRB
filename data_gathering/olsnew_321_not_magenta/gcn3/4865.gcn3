on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

The UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 200 seconds with the
V filter starting 14.4 hours after the BAT trigger. No afterglow
candidate has been found in the 2.7'x2.7' sub-image which
covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The 3-sigma UL at the
XRT position is 0.9 cps or 18.0 mag. No correction has
been made for the expected extinction of about 0.6 magnitudes.
