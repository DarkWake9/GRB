S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC)  on behalf of the Swift team:
 
Swift-BAT triggers 373776, 373777, and 373778 are not real.
They are due to false positive detections in image-trigger mode
while the the spacecraft star tracker was in loss-of-lock.

Only five SIMBAD_NED notices were distributed.  None of the other Swift Notices
in the usual sequence were distributed -- they were blocked in GCN.
(I am working on code in GCN to prevent even this limited scenario.)

Please disregard these notices.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
