Shaolin Xiong (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:32:07.85 UT on 18 January 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140118A (trigger 411701530 / 140118064),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Krimm et al., GCN 15748;
Lien et al., GCN 15750).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two separate pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 92 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-74 s to T0+23 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with index -1.89 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.0 +/- 0.4)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-2.05 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
