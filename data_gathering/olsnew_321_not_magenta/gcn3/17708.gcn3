We observed the position of GRB 150413A (Markwardt et al., GCN 17688)
at 15 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on
2015 April 14.745 to 14.973 UT, corresponding to 1.2 days post-burst.
On this date we possibly detected a radio source coincident with the
MASTER’s optical position (Ivanov et al., GCN 17689) with a preliminary
flux of 0.19 +/- 0.04 mJy. There are no catalogued radio sources at this 
position.

An earlier observation was conducted on 2015 April 13.747 to 13.914 UT,
corresponding to 0.2 days post-burst, yielding a 3 sigma flux upper limit
of 0.15 mJy.

Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling 
these observations.
