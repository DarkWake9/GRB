D. Milisavljevic, M. Drout, and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We obtained an optical spectrum of GRB 120119A (GCN 12859) with the
Blue Channel spectrograph mounted on the MMT 6.5-m telescope.  In a
single 1800 sec exposure covering 3500-8500 Ang we find a wide range
of absorption features (from CII1335 to MgI2853) at a common redshift
of z=1.728, confirming the results of Cucchiara & Prochaska (GCN
12865)."
