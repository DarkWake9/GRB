E. Semkov (Institute of Astronomy, Sofia, Bulgaria) report:
 
We continue our observations of the afterglow of HETE burst (H2652) GRB 
030329 (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985; Torii: GCN 1986) with the 2m RCC 
telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria).
We obtained four 300 s exposures on 25 Apr UT 19:30 with Photometrics 
CCD camera and Rc filter. The observations were carried out under good 
seeing and atmospheric conditions. Using field photometry of Henden 
(GCN2082) and after co-adding of frames we estimate the brightness of 
the optical afterglow as Rc = 20.21 +/-0.09.
