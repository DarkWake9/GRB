B. Gendre (ASDC/OaR/INAF), C. Feruglio (IRAM), G. Stratta (OaR) report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The GRB 121011A will be observed by XMM-Newton from 2012 Oct. 11 18:33 
UT, until Oct 12 at 11:30 UT. This observation is coordinated with an 
IRAM observation at the Interferometer of the Plateau de Bure.

We encourage any follow-up at all wavelengths, and specially 
spectroscopic observations to derive a redshift for this event.
