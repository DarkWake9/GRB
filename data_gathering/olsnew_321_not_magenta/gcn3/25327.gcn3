report on behalf of the AGILE Team:


In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190814bv at T0 = 2019-08-14
21:10:39 UTC,

a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data
found no

event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the
LIGO/Virgo T0.


At the T0, 100% of the S190814bv 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to

the AGILE-MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s
integration

time at different celestial positions within the accessible S190814bv
localization

region, from a minimum of 2.0E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 1.1E-06 erg
cm^-2 (assuming

as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).


The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy

range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
