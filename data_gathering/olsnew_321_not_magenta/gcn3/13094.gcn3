Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120324A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 518507) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 1.98h after the GRB trigger
(it was not risen when the GRB occured).
The elevation of the field increased from
11 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a long series of exposures. We do not
detect any OT in the XRT enhanced position (Evans et al.
GCNC 13093):

      start      end    magnitude
tgrb+1.98h tgrb+3.23h  R > 19.7

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 58.0588 lat= +4.0337
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 3 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
