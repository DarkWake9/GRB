FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 1374.0 ks of promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 100606A,
we find an enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 350.6265,
-66.2411 which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 23 22 30.37
   Dec (J2000) = -66 14 28.1
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arc sec (radius, 90% confidence). Analysis
of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/424031.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
