J. Bolmer, J. Greiner, and T.-W. Chen (all MPE) report

We have been using GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) to follow up the
afterglow of GRB 190829A (Dichiara et al., GCN 25552) at z=0.08 (Valeev et al.,
GCN 25565).
The light of the optical transient has been fading in all GROND bands during the first 
days, was then flattening and is now finally showing a relativley sharp rise in all seven
GROND bands (e.g. about 0.5 mag in z' to 19.55 +/- 0.03 mag_AB; 330s integration
time) between 4.5 and 5.5 days
after the BAT trigger. This behavior can be interpreted as the 
upcoming supernova component.

Further spectroscopic follow up is encouraged.
