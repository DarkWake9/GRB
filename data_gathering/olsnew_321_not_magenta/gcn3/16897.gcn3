The long-duration GRB 141005A (Swift-BAT trigger 614415:
D'Elia, GCN 16882; Krimm et al., GCN 16893;
Fermi-GBM detection: Roberts, GCN 16889)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=18787.727 s UT (05:13:07.727).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~3 s.
The emission is seen up to ~1 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.3(-0.2,+0.3)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.390 s,
of 1.6(-0.5,+0.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.34(-0.49,+0.58),
and Ep = 104(-14,+18) keV (chi2 = 33/55 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index:
beta < -2.37 (chi2 = 31/54 dof).
