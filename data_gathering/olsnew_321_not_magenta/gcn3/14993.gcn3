report:

We observed the field of GRB 130702A (Singer et al., GCN 14967; Cheung et
al., GCN 14971; Collazzi & Connaughton, GCN 14972) with the Reionization
and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir on the nights of 2013/07/06 and 2013/07/07 (4.25 and 5.26 days
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.4 hours exposure in the r'
and i' bands and 0.6 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands each night.

At the position of the source from Singer et al. (GCN 14967), in comparison
with SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

          7/06                        7/07
 r'   19.86 +/- 0.02   19.94 +/- 0.02
 i'   19.89 +/- 0.03   20.02 +/- 0.02
 Z   19.68 +/- 0.05   19.76 +/- 0.04
 Y   19.46 +/- 0.05   19.69 +/- 0.05
 J   19.64 +/- 0.07   19.64 +/- 0.06
 H   19.36 +/- 0.08   19.69 +/- 0.08

The source appears to be slowly fading, approximately 0.1 mag/day, or
approximately as t^-0.35.  This is a significant flattening relative to the
bright fluxes we measured 2 days after the GRB (Butler et al.; GCN 14980).
 These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  Further observations are underway.

Mártir.
