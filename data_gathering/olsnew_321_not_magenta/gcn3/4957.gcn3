P. Romano (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

BAT detected a GRB at 18:40:24. The BAT in-flight position is
RA, Dec 291.300d, +13.808d (J2000). There were no immediate
notices because the TDRSS link was down at the time. No 
information is available about the light curve until the
full data arrive in about an hour. 

XRT began observing at 18:42:19UT, 115 seconds after the BAT trigger. 
XRT centroided on a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray point source at the
following coordinates:  

RA(J2000):   19 25 07.5 
Dec(J2000): +13 45 26.4 

with an estimated uncertainty of 5 arcsec radius (90% containment). 
This position is 194 arcseconds from the BAT position. The estimated flux 
from this burst is 1.0E-8 erg/s/cm^2 (0.2-10 keV). Note that the flux in 
the GCN XRT position notice was underestimated by a factor of 10. 

The UVOT took a V finding chart. Only raw data (no coordinates) are
available at  this time. Further results will be available following
the full data download.
