We began to observe the field of GRB 130420A  (Page et al., GCN 14406 )
using  80cm TNT telescope located at Xinglong observatory, China
at 12:16:56 UT on 2013-04-20. We obtained 12x300s R-band images in a
poor seeing and cloudy weather, with a median time of 5.3 hr after the BAT trigger.

The afterglow reported (Page et a., GCN 14406 ) is not detected in the stacked image, 
down to a 3 sigma limit of R~18.0 mag, calibrated with USNO B2 stars.
