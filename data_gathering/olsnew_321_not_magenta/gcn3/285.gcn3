K. Hurley, T. Cline, and E. Mazets, on behalf of the Ulysses-GRB,
KONUS-WIND, and NEAR GRB teams, report:

We have refined the error box of GRB990321 (GCN 283).  The new
box, which is entirely contained within the old one, has an
area of ~290 sq. arcminutes.  Its corners have the following
coordinates:

          RA(2000)              DEC(2000)
     13 H 01 M 33.51 S      79 D 37 M 25.99 S
     13 H 22 M 05.19 S      79 D 03 M 18.34 S
     13 H 10 M 26.62 S      79 D 28 M 40.46 S
     13 H 13 M 40.76 S      79 D 13 M 20.77 S
     13 H 01 M 26.89 S      79 D 37 M 43.00 S
     13 H 22 M 10.97 S      79 D 02 M 59.68 S

This error box may be viewed at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990321.  
Further improvement will be possible when the final data are
received.
