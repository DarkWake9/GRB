report:

   We have observed the GRB 030429 optical afterglow (HETE trigger 
2695) with the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish Telescope RTT150 at TUG.

   A set of 10 exposures by 5 min. duration each  with Rc Bessell 
filter has been obtained on the night May 02/03, 2003, under good photometric 
conditions. Inspite of that TO was observered on large zenith distance, 
the seeing was stable and about 1.8 arcsec. We used TE Andor CCD with 
Marcony back-illuminated 2048 x 2048 chip (binned 2*2) cooled to -60C temperature.
   Aperture photometry was done according to Landolt stars observered 
at the same night.
   On combined (50 min) image there are two extended sources at the 
position of TO as noted in Fyndo at al. (GCN 2185). The brightness of the sources 
are close and Rc=23.5+/-0.5. Photometry was done without color term correction.
The bright source on about 7 arcsec northeast of TO is not a star-like 
source. Combined image and part of finding chart from Gilmore at al. (GCN 
2184) can be found at
