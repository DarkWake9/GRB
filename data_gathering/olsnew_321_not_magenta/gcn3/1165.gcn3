write:

The HETE WXM instrument has detected (>7 sigma) a GRB (trigger 
H1864). The burst occurred at 22775.66 SOD (6:19:35 UT) on 30 
November. The burst is  well-localized by the WXM but occurred before 
dusk and at full moon (phase >0.96); consequently the error in the 
spacecraft aspect is much larger than normal. The statistical error 
radius in the WXM localization is 14 arcmin (90% confidence). In 
addition, we estimate a systematic error radius at present of 60 
arcmin about this location due to the uncertainty in spacecraft 
aspect. The resulting localization is therefore

R.A. = 02h58m09s.1, Dec = 07o24'40"

with a total error of 60 arcminutes.

The burst duration in the 2-25 keV band was ~5 s. A total of 500 
counts were detected during that interval. The spectrum is soft, 
making an estimate of the peak flux and fluence highly uncertain.

Further refinement of the spacecraft aspect, and thus the burst 
localization, is in progress.

This message is quotable.
