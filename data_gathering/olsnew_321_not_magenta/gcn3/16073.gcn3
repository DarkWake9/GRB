Based on 10 seconds of photon event data, we present refined analysis of
the BAT data on GRB 140402A (Bissaldi et al. GCN Circ #16069, Cummings
et al. GCN Circ #16071).

The best BAT location is RA, Dec 207.592, +5.971, which is:

RA(J2000) 13h 50m 22.2s
Dec(J2000) 05d 58' 16"

with an estimated 90% confidence radius of 2.8 arcmin.  This is 4 arcmin
from the previously reported BAT position based on the immediately
transmitted data (4 arcmin estimated 90% error), and 9.5 arcmin from the
Fermi-LAT position (12 arcmin estimated statistical 90% error).

The mask-weighted lightcurve shows a single nearly square pulse. T90
was about 0.031 +/- 0.003 seconds (estimated 90% confidence).

A powerlaw fit to the spectrum from 15 to 150 keV has a photon index of
0.89 +/- 0.44 (90% confidence). In 0.034 seconds the fluence was
(3.8 +/- 1.2) x 10^-8 ergs/cm^2 (62% confidence).
