R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 01:34:07 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160726A (trigger=706052).  Swift did not slew immediately
due to an observational constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 98.821, -6.644 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 35m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = -06d 38' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~14000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.7 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 12:53 UT on 2016 August 10. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is R. L. C. Starling (rlcs1 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
