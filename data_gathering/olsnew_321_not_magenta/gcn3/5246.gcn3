Using the data set from T-239.4 to T+250 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060607
(trigger #213934)  (Krimm, et al., GCN 5244).  The BAT 
ground-calculated position
is (RA,Dec) = 42.048, 14.749 deg {2h 48m 11.6s, 14d 44' 57.1"} (J2000)
+- 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial 
coding was 35%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a double-peaked structure with peaks at
T+1 sec and T+9 sec.  There is low-level emission out to T+30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 31 +- 5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+37.1 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.   The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.63 +- 0.12. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.7 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+8.64 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
