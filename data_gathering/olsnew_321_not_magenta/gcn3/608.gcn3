NUMBER:  608
SUBJECT: GRB 000307, BVRI Field Photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired preliminary BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
the field of GRB000307 with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one
photometric night.  This 11x11arcmin field covers the IPN
error box and extends a little fainter than V=20.  All stars
brighter than V=14 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000307.dat
This file will be updated if an optical transient is discovered.
The current photometry has a potential external zero-point
error of about two percent.

The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate
solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors
are less than 100mas.
