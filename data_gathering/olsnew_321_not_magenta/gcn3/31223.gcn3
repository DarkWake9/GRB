SUBJECT: GRB 211211A: incorrect E_iso value in GCN 31221

D. B. Malesani (Radboud Univ. and DAWN/NBI) reports:

The GRB 211211A E_iso value reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 31221) is 
incorrect. Using the Fermi GBM fluence 5.4*10^-4 erg cm^-2 (Mangan et 
al., GCN 31210), the corresponding E_iso value is 6.9*10^51 erg, 
assuming the GRB is at z = 0.076.

The conclusion that GRB 211211A would not be consistent with the Amati 
relation if at z = 0.076 was based on the correct E_iso value, and still 
holds. This may indicate that the GRB lies in fact at a higher redshift.

I sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by this mistake, and I am 
grateful to those who pointed it out, including Peter Veres, D. 
Alexander Kann, and Lorenzo Amati. No blame should be assigned to the 
other co-authors of GCN 31221, who saw an earlier draft which did not 
contain the mistake.
