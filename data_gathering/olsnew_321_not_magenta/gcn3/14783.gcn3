(FINCA) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130606A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14781) using
the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the MOSCA
imager. Observations started at 21:35 UT on 2013-06-06 (i.e., 0.5 hr
after the burst) and 2x300 s frames were obtained in the Sloan
r-filter.

Close to the refined XRT position, we detect an object not visible in
the DSS and SDSS images of the field, at the following coordinates:

RA (J2000) = 16:37:35.188
Dec(J2000) = +29:47:47.03

These coordinates are formally outside the XRT error circle, which is
however affected by extra systematic uncertainties due to the problems
in the satellite attitude (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14781). The object has
m(r) = 20.8, calibrated against the SDSS.

We suggest this object is the afterglow of GRB 130606A. It is probably
the same object reported by Jelinek et al. (GCN 14782).
