P.A. Price (IfA), T. Minezaki (U. Tokyo), L. Cowie (IfA) and Y. Yoshii
(U. Tokyo) report on behalf of the UH-MAGNUM GRB collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 050416 (Cenko & Fox, GCN #3265)
with the automated MAGNUM telescope + MIP dual-beam optical-NIR imager,
commencing at April 16.53 UTC.  The observations were performed in poor
seeing with clouds which prevented detection in the I and K bands. 
Nevertheless, we detected the afterglow in the R, J and H bands.  Based
on comparison with a single USNO-B1 star, we estimate that the optical
afterglow was about R ~ 21.3 mag at the epoch of our observations.
