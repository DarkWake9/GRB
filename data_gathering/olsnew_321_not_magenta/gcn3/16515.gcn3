D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 140703A (Kocevski et al., GCN 16503) 
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy starting at 
2013-07-03 16:39:55 UT (0.668 days post-GRB) at a mean frequency of ~93 
GHz; the observation is still ongoing.

We detect a strong source in the existing data set at the location of 
the X-ray and optical afterglows (Goad et al., GCN 16506; Castro-Tirado 
et al., GCN 16504) with a flux of approximately 2 mJy.

We thank Nikolaus Volgenau, observers K. Jameson and E. Grand, and the 
CARMA staff for executing the observation.
