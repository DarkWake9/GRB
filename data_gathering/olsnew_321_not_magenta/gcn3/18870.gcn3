report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has performed a series of 264 observations of galaxies (from the
GWGC catalogue) within the aLIGO error region for the aLIGO trigger
G211117, using the 'bayestar' GW localisation map. The observations
currently span from 140 ks to 1677 ks after the aLIGO trigger, and
cover 32.3 sq degrees on the sky (corrected for overlaps).

Since the last Swift GCN, we have detected 8 X-ray sources, these are
either new detections, or have been given a higher 'rank' than in the
last circular. Each source is assigned a rank of 1-4 which describes
how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger, with 1 being the most
likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks are described at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 6 sources of rank 3
  * 2 sources of rank 4

We assumed a power-law spectrum with NH=3e20 cm^2, and photon index
(Gamma)=1.7

Several other sources were circulated as GCN/LVC Counterpart notices
(including one with a rank of 2) with a flag identifying them as
potentially spurious. Manual inspection of the images confirms that
these were not point sources, but artifacts caused by an area of
diffuse X-ray emission, centred on RA~02h 32m 37s Dec~+18d 44' 10",
with a radius of ~0.6 arcmin.

RANK 3 sources
==============

These are uncatalogued X-ray sources, however they are not brighter
than previous upper limits, so do not stand out as likely counterparts
to the GW trigger.

RANK 4 sources
==============

compared to previous observations, so they are not likely to be related
to the GW trigger.
