P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA) report on behalf of 
the Swift/XRT team:

We have reanalysed the promptly downlinked XRT data of GRB 070802 
(Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ 6692) using PSF fitting and exposure maps to 
improve the XRT position. We find an improved position of RA, 
Dec=36.89776, -55.52851 whic is equivalent to:

RA (J2000)  = 02 27 35.46
Dec (J2000) = -55 31 42.7

With an uncertainty of 4.7" (radius, 90% containment). This position is 
3.3" from the original XRT position sent out in GCN Circ. 6692.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.

[GCN OPS NOTE(02aug07): Per author's request. the Subject line was changed
from "070702" to "070802".]
