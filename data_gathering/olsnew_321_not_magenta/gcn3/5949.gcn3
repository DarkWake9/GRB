E. Berger (Carnegie) reports:

"We observed the location of GRB 061217 with LDSS3 on the Magellan 6.5-m 
telescpe starting on 2006 Dec. 21.36 UT in r-band.  In a single 300 sec 
exposure with 0.55" seeing we clearly detect an extended object (G1) 
within the revised XRT position (GCN #5947) at:
 	RA = 10:41:39.15
 	DEC=-21:07:27.3
A second, much fainter object with apparently extended morphology (G2) is 
located on the southern edge of the error circle at:
         RA = 10:41:39.10
         DEC=-21:07:33.1
We propose that object G1 is the host galaxy of GRB 061217."
