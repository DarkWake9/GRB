J.P.U. Fynbo, C.C. Thoene, D. Malesani, J. Hjorth, P.M. Vreeswijk 
(DARK), and P. Jakobsson (Univ. Hertfordshire) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We inspected in detail our VLT spectra (Thoene et al., GCN 5812) of the 
afterglow of GRB 061110A (Falcone et al., GCN 5795; Chen et al., GCN 5797).

Further to the lines reported in GCN 5812 (6552 and 8803 A), interpreted 
as [OII] and [OIII] 5007 at z=0.758, we also detect emission at 8547 A, 
which corresponds to Hbeta at the same redshift. We thus consider the 
redshift to be secure.
