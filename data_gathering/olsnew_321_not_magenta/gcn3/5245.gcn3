TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5245
SUBJECT: GRB060602A: Swift/UVOT upper limits
DATE:    06/06/08 12:41:19 GMT
FROM:    Alexander Blustin at MSSL-UCL  <ajb@mssl.ucl.ac.uk>

A. J. Blustin (UCL-MSSL) and P. Schady (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf
of the Swift/UVOT team:

Due to a moon constraint, Swift/UVOT did not begin observing the
field of GRB060602A until 15:55:25 on 2006-06-04, 1.766 days after
the BAT trigger (Schady et al., GCN 5196). We observe no optical/UV
afterglow candidate within the refined BAT error circle (Sakamoto
et al. 5206) or at the position of the afterglow candidate reported
by the NOT team (Jensen et al., GCN 5203). 3-sigma magnitude upper
limits, in coadded images, at the position of the NOT afterglow
candidate are as follows:

Filter   T_range(days)  Exp(s)  3sig_UL(mag)
V        1.831-3.555    1775    21.3
B        1.827-3.567    1572    22.3
U        1.826-3.564    1775    22.1
UVW1     1.766-3.561    1850    21.7
UVM2     1.832-3.558    1922    22.0
UVW2     1.828-3.617    2265    22.3

Where the time range of the images post-trigger is given in days.
The upper limits are not corrected for Galactic extinction.
