report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:36:53.59 UT on 16 July 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130716A (trigger 395663816 / 130716442)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Cummings et al. 2013, GCN 15006).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of two overlapping pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 0.8 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.256 s to T0+0.576 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.23 (+0.28/-0.24) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 635 (+184/-112)  keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.2 +/- 0.7)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-msec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.256 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.2 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
