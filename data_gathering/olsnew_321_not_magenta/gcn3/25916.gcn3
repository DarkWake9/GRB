We report the photometric measurements of two optical counterpart
candidates ZTF19acbpqlh (AT2019rpn) and ATLAS19wyn/ZTF19acbpsuf
(AT2019rpj) associated with the gravitational wave event S190930t (GCN
#25876, #25899) using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan.
The observations were conducted using g, r, i filters starting at
2019-10-01 14:12:14 UT. Preliminary photometry was obtained by
calibrating with the Pan-STARRS catalog.

Summary of ZTF19acbpqlh:

We would like to thank the staff in Lulin Observatory for helping the
observations.
