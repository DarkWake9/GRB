The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 00:30:46.05 UT on 3 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210903B (trigger 652321851 / 210903021).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 270.9, Dec = +15.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 03m, +15d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 26.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
