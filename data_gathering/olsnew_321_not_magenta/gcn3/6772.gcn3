A. Fruchter, J. Graham and A. Levan report for a larger group:

We observed the field of the candidate orphan optical transient in IC  
4779 with GMOS on the Gemini South telescope for a total integration  
time of 10 minutes, starting at 1:03  UT on 1 September 2007.  The  
sky was photometric and the seeing in the combined image was 0."5.    
We find no evidence of a point source on the field of the galaxy at  
the location of the candidate orphan down to a magnitude of about  
24.5  in r.   We thank Alain Klotz for sending us copies of the  
original discovery images, which allowed us to align the Gemini and  
discovery images with an accuracy of nearly 0."1.
