The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:11:48 UT on 22 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200622A (trigger 614484713.116416 / 200622092).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 107.5, Dec = 38.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 10m, 38d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
