S. Immler (NASA/CRESST/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) follow-up observations
of GRB 080625 (Pacciani et al., GCN Circ. 7903), starting ~25.9 hrs
after the AGILE trigger, confirm the fading of the optical afterglow
(Immler et al., GCN Circ. 7905; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN Circ. 7907).

The following magnitude is measured in the co-added image obtained
in the White filter:

Filter   T_start [s]   T_stop [s]   Exp [s]   Magnitude

White    93,092        162,754      5,776      21.3 +/- 0.1

The magnitude quoted above is in the UVOT photometric system
(Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627). No correction has been
made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.14 mag in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
Note the corrected value for the extinction compared to Immler
2008 (GCN Circ. 7905).
