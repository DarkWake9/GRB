S. Covino, S. Piranomonte, P. D'Avanzo, L.A. Antonelli, F. de Luise,  
M. Pedani, N. Pinilla Alfonso report, on behalf of the CIBO  
collaboration:

We observed the field of the short/hard GRB070714B (Racusin et al.,  
GCN 6620; Barbier et al., GCN 6623) on July 15 2007 at about 5 UT  
with the TNG equipped with NICS in the J and K bands. The  
observations were performed at high airmass (higher than 2).

We only marginally detected the afterglow identified by Melandri et  
al. (GCN 6621) and Levan et al. (GCN 6630) in the K band at  
approximately K~21. In the J band we could only derive a mild 3sigma  
upper limit, J > 20.7.
