I.A. Steele, C.M. Copperwheat, A. S. Piascik (Liverpool JMU) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

Observations of 7 of the proposed iPTF candidates (GCN 18497) using the 
SPRAT spectrograph of the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope (La Palma) have been obtained.  
The spectral  resolution was R~350 and the wavelength range 4000 - 8000 Angstroms.

iPTF-15dln was observed on 2015-10-28 at 00:24UT.  The transient can not be obviously 
distinguished from the host galaxy in our acquisition images.  Our spectrum shows absorption 
lines of the host galaxy with redshift z=0.051.

iPTF-15dkk was observed on 2015-10-28 at 20:34UT.  The transient can not be obviously 
distinguished from the host galaxy in our acquisition images.  Our spectrum shows absorption 
lines of the host galaxy with redshift z=0.061.

iPTF-15dkn was observed on 2015-10-28 at 21:09UT.  The transient can not be distinguished
from the host galaxy in our acquisition images.  Our spectrum shows absorption lines of the 
host galaxy with redshift z=0.074.

iPTF-15dkm was observed on 2015-10-28 at 21:41UT.  Our spectrum shows broad H-alpha 
emission and is consistent with a Supernova as reported in GCN 18536.  

iPTF-15dmn was observed on 2015-10-28 at 22:15UT.  Our spectrum shows narrow emission 
line features typical of an AGN at redshift z=0.056.

iPTF-15dni was observed on 2015-10-28 at 23:08UT.  The spectrum shows weak H-alpha emission 
and typical galaxy absorption lines.  Both the H-alpha emission and the absorption spectra have 
redshift z=0.020.

iPTF-15dnh was observed on 2015-10-29 at 01:16UT.  The transient can not be obviously 
distinguished from the host galaxy in our acquisition images.  Our spectrum shows absorption 
lines of the host galaxy with redshift z=0.056.

Further analysis is ongoing.
