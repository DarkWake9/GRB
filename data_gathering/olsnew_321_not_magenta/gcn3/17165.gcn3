J. A. Kennea (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) 
report on behalf of the Swift/XRT Team:

At 13:25:13.4 UT on December 12, 2014, 85.2 seconds after the BAT trigger, 
XRT began observing GRB 141212B. We find a uncatalogued source at an XRT 
count rate of 2-3 c/s during the first orbit, and 0.4 c/s during the 2nd 
orbit observations. Based on 140s of PC mode data, we find a preliminary 
localization of RA/Dec(J2000) = 250.87573, 31.752983, equivalent to:

RA(J2000)  = 16h 43m 30.1s
Dec(J2000) = 31d 45m 10.7s

with an estimated uncertainty of 10 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). 
We expect this position to be improved as we collect more data.
