A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration, very bright GRB 190706C
has been detected by INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS trigger 8325),
CALET (GBM trigger 1246455687), Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT),
so far, at about 49348 s UT (13:42:28).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   351.671 (23h 26m 41s) +24.754 (+24d 45' 15")
  Corners:
   352.463 (23h 29m 51s) +23.689 (+23d 41' 22")
   352.742 (23h 30m 58s) +23.905 (+23d 54' 20")
   350.850 (23h 23m 24s) +25.803 (+25d 48' 11")
   350.570 (23h 22m 17s) +25.583 (+25d 35' 00")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is about 3079 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 2.59 deg (the minimum one is 20.0 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 100 deg.

This box may be improved.

This burst is spatially and temporally inconsistent with
LIGO/Virgo S190706ai (LVC GCN Circ. 24998) and
LIGO/Virgo S190707q (LVC GCN Circ. 25012).

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
