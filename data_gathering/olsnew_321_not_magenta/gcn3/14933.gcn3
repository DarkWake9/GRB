SUBJECT: GRB 130627A: Swift detection of a burst

S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL), V. D'Elia (ASDC), P. A. Evans (U Leicester)
and A. Y. Lien (NASA/GSFC/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:55:03 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130627A (trigger=559132).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 184.445, -37.086 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 17m 47s
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 05' 09"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+46.0
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (samantha.oates AT ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
