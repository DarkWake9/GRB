Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), Evan Bryson,
Matt Cefalu, and Todd Hillwig (Valparaiso University) report on behalf
of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We observed the field of GRB 071025 (GCN 6986, Pagani et al.) with the
0.9m SARA telescope on Kitt Peak beginning 49 minutes after the
trigger.  Our observations consisted of R, V, and I band exposures under
good weather conditions.  We do not detect the afterglow (GCN 6987,
Rykoff et al.) in any of our stacked images.

Times are given in days after the trigger.  R and I magnitudes were
determined based on calibration to 10 USNO B1.0 field stars.  V
magnitudes were found relative to 5 NOMAD field stars.
