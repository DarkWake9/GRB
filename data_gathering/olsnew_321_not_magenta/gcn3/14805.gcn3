S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) and
J. A. Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:17:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
an outburst from SGR J1745-29 (trigger=557640).  Swift did not slew to the source
because of the existence of a higher-merit automated target.  There will be
no XRT or UVOT data on this event.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA, Dec 266.433, -28.992 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 45m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -28d 59' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single soft
peak with a duration of < 0.32 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

After the trigger on April 25th (Barthelmy et al, GCN #14443), this is
the second burst from SGR J1745-29 detected by BAT.
