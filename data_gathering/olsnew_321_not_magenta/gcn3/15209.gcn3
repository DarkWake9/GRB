report:

We observed the field of GRB 130907A (Page et al., GCN 15183) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/09 11.12 to 2013/09 11.16 UTC (77.18 to
78.08 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.71 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.30 hours exposure in the Z and Y.

For the source reported in Lee et al. (GCN 15192), in comparison with SDSS
DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections and upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r     22.40 +/- 0.14
  i     21.73 +/- 0.10
  Z     > 21.80
  Y     > 21.05

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source has faded by about 0.4
mags in the r and i bands relative to our observations last night (Butler
et al., GCN 15208).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
