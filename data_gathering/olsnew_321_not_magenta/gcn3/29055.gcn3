We report on the complete Chandra data set of observations of GW170817
acquired at t=1209-1213 days since merger (IDs 22677, 24887, 24888, and
24889; PI Margutti; program 21510449) for a total exposure time of ~91 ks.
Preliminary results from a subset of these observations have been reported
by Hajela et al., GCN 29041, GCN 29019; Troja et al., GCN 29038.

We confirm the presence of significant X-ray emission from GW170817
(significance of detection > 5 sigma, Gaussian equivalent) from the merged
observations, with a source count rate of (0.9 +/- 0.3) e-4 cps (0.5-8
keV). From a joint spectral fit with a simple power-law spectral model
using a photon index Gamma ~ 1.6, no intrinsic absorption NHint = 0 cm-2
(as found in e.g. Hajela et al. 2019), and Galactic neutral hydrogen column
density NH,gal = 7.8e+20 cm-2 (Kalberla et al., 2005), we estimate an
unabsorbed flux of 3.46(+1.06 -1.31) e-15 erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV, 1-sigma
uncertainties), corresponding to a luminosity of 6.9 (+2.1 -2.6) e+38 erg/s
at the distance of 40.7 Mpc (Cantiello et al., 2018). The observed emission
is a factor of ~2 brighter than the first X-ray non-detection of GW170817
at ~2 days after merger.

As previously reported in Hajela et al., GCN 29041, the inferred flux is in
excess to the extrapolation of the off-axis jet model that best fits the
broad-band afterglow observations at t<580 days (e. g., Hajela et al. 2019)
and might represent the emergence of a new component of emission. An
updated plot of the X-ray evolution of GW170817 can be found here:
