At 04:58:50 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060210 (trigger=180977).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The BAT on-board calculated location is
RA,Dec 57.730d,+27.026d {03h 50m 55s,+27d 01' 33"} (J2000), with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows
a two-peak structure with a total duration of ~5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 seconds after the trigger.

The XRT began observing the field at 05:00:25 UT, 95 seconds after the
BAT trigger.  XRT found a  variable, uncatalogued X-ray source
located at RA(J2000) = +03h 50m 57.2s, Dec(J2000) = +27d 01' 38.2", with an
estimated uncertainty of 5.4 arcseconds (90% confidence radius).
This location is 27 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within
the BAT error circle.  The initial flux in the 2.50s image was
4.6e-09 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV).

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 200 seconds with the V filter starting
99 seconds after the BAT trigger.  No afterglow candidate has been found in the
initial data products.  The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error
circle.  The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18th mag.  The 8'x8'
region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error
circle.  The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag.
No correction has been made for the expected extinction of about 0.3 magnitudes.
