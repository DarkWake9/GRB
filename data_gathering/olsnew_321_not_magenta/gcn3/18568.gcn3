Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151107A (trigger #662757)
( Lien et al., GCN Circ. 18564).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 217.139, -59.680 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  14h 28m 33.4s
  Dec(J2000) = -59d -40' -46.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows no obvious structure. The event starts
before the beginning of captured data at T-239 sec and extends out past the
end of collected event data at T+910 sec when the source location left the FoV
when the spacecraft slewed to a new target.

This burst occurred during the period of recovering the thermal control system
(Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 18562). The CZT bias voltage has been reduced
to -150v (instead of the normal -200v) and as such the energy scale is not fully
calibrated. Therefore, an accurate spectral analysis is unavailable.
