on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB070518 with 1-m Zeiss (Simeiz) telescopes
of CrAO in R-band on May 18 between (UT)19:35 and 20:30. Due to
blending of the nearby star (USNO-A2.0 R=3D18.7) and poor seeing (~4.5")
we do not resolve clearly optical transient (Guidorzi et al., GCN
6415) in a combined image. More sophisticated photometry estimation is
underway. A limiting magnitude of the combined image is based on USNO
A2.0:

Mid time (UT),  Exposure,   R_Lim (3sigma),   Seeing

May 18.835      50x60       22.0              4.5"
