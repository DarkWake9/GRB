SUBJECT: GRB 080828: Swift-XRT detection of a possible X-ray afterglow

A.P. Beardmore and R.L.C. Starling (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT began observations of the field of the SuperAGILE detected
GRB 080828 (Del Monte et al., GCN Circ 8151) at 2008-08-28 14:07:17UT,
39.15 ks after  the burst. In 4.96 ks of photon counting mode data we
detect a faint, uncatalogued X-ray source at RA, Dec 199.5871, -65.9405
which is
RA  (J2000) =  13:18:20.91
Dec (J2000) = -65:56:25.8
with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This source  is 1.1 arcmin away from the AGILE position and within
its error circle.

The measured XRT count rate is 0.008 +/- 0.001 count/s. At this stage
we cannot tell whether the source is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
