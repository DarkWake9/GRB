report:

The refined SWIFT/XRT error box (Hill et al. GCN 2955) 
for GRB 050117 (Sakamoto et al. GCN 2952) has been 
observed with the 1.5 m telescope at the Observatorio 
de Sierra Nevada in Granada, southern Spain. I-band 
(6 x 300 s) images were acquired starting on 17 Jan, 
18:30 UT (i.e. about 5.6 hr after the GRB trigger). 
No new sources within the error box are found when 
comparing with the DSS-2 plates down to I = 20.5 . 
Near-IR images -specially in the K-band- would be 
required in order to indentify the afterglow at these 
wavelengths, as there is severe extinction in the line 
of sight (A_I = 3.40; A_K = 0.65). This has been also 
pointed out by Torii (GCN 2956).
