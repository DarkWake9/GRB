A. C. Updike, D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) and K. Rumstay 
(Valdosta University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 070419A (GCN 6302, Stamatikos et al.) 
beginning 54 minutes after the trigger (276205) with the SARA 0.9m at 
Kitt Peak under good weather conditions.  In 16 minutes of stacked 
images, we see a faint object near our detection limit at the location 
of the afterglow (GCN 6304, Charnack et al.).  We estimate the R-band 
magnitude to be 20 +/- 0.5 based on calibration to 5 USNO B1.0 stars.
