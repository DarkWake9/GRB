The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:15:57 UT on 8 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200808A (trigger 618578162.404866 / 200808469).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 20.1, Dec = 55.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 20m, 55d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 38.0 degrees.
