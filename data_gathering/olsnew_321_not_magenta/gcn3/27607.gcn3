The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 02:32:58 UT on 20 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200420A (trigger 609042783.59756 / 200420106).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 310.3, Dec = -27.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 41m, -27d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 85.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
