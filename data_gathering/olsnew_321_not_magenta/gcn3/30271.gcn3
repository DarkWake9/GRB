D. A. Perley (LJMU) reports:

We acquired multicolor imaging of the optical afterglow of GRB 210619B 
(D'Avanzo et al., GCN 30261) using the IO:O camera of the 2m robotic 
Liverpool Telescope.  The afterglow was observed twice in the ugriz 
filters on 2021-06-20 UT, with the first epoch taking place between 
02:35:06 and 02:42:40 and the second between 03:49:15 and 03:56:49.

Photometry with reference to Pan-STARRS 1 secondary standard stars in 
the field gives the following magnitudes:

t-tburst(d) filter mag    unc
0.10772     g      18.58  0.03
0.10879     r      17.82  0.03
0.10984     i      17.44  0.04
0.11227     z      17.17  0.04
0.15920     g      18.93  0.03
0.16028     r      18.11  0.03
0.16133     i      17.74  0.04
0.16376     z      17.47  0.04

These values have not been corrected for Galactic extintion.

The colors (after applying a Galactic extinction correction) suggest a 
moderately dust-reddened afterglow.
