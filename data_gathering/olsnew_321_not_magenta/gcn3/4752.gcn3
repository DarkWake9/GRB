S. B. Cenko, E. O. Ofek, A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. B. Fox (Penn
State) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060211b (Mateos et al., GCN 4739) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Our observations were taken in the R
and i' filters at a mean epoch of approximately Feb. 12.21 UT.  Inside the
revised XRT error circle (Page et al., GCN 4745) we find no sources.  The
limiting magnitude of our observations, calculated with respect to the
USNOB R and I filters, is approximately R,I > 21.0.
