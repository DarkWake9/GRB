At 4h 30m  after  HETE GRB trigger time (alert 3570)   MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had imaging  the corresponding area
of the sky under the large zenit distance and bad weather conditions.
The first image was started at 16h53m UT.

We have 50 unfiltered images of the error box (45s exposition, 40 x 50
arcmin, 200 mm camera).

There is no optical transient up to 18.4 m at position da Costa et al.
(GCN2765).



Sum FITS image  are available at

PS. Our wide-field camera (355mm) with AP16e CCD-camera are upgrading. So
last 5 circulars  ( GCN >=2659) based on observations on small telescope.
