K. Wiersema, D. Malesani and A. Levan report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 090709A (Morris et al., GCN 9625) with the
William Herschel Telescope, using the LIRIS instrument.
We obtained a total of 1890 secs of exposure time in J band, under reasonable 
conditions, starting at 04:48 UT July 10th (20.8 hrs after burst).

We do not detect the afterglow (Aoki et al. GCN 9634; Morgan et
al. GCN 9635), with limiting magnitude J>~20. Source A of Aoki et al is 
clearly detected.

We are grateful to Don Pollaco and Ian Skillen for performing these 
observations.
