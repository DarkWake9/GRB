Christina C. Thoene, Johan P.U. Fynbo (DARK-NBI), Pall Jakobsson (Univ. of
Hertfordshire), Paul M. Vreeswijk (ESO) and Jens Hjorth (DARK-NBI) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We obtained a series of 3x1800s spectra of the OT of GRB 061110A
(GCNs 5797, 5798, 5799) on November 11, 02:50UT (15h after the burst),
using FORS1/VLT and grism 300V. At the time of the observations, the OT
had a magnitude of about R=22 using photometric zeropoints from the ESO
webpages.

Based on the detection of weak emission lines at 6551 AA and 8803 AA which
we interpret as [OII] 3727 and [OIII] 5007 from the host galaxy, we
determine a tentative redshift of z=0.757 for GRB 061110A. The continuum
extends down to the blue end of the spectrum at 3600 AA which places an
additional limit of z<2 on the redshift of this burst.


We thank the staff at VLT for performing the observations.
