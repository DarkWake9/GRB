D. A. Perley (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report:

We acquired additional imaging of the afterglow of GRB 140629A (Lien et 
al., GCN 16477; Yurkov et al. GCN 16478) with the Palomar 60-inch (P60) 
robotic telescope on UT 2014-07-01 between 04:23 and 04:52, acquiring 
9x180s exposures in the r' filter.  We measure a magnitude of:

r = 22.92 +/- 0.14   (t_mid = 1.598 days)

This indicates a relatively rapid decay index of alpha=1.87 since our 
observation the previous night (see also Garnavich and Rose, GCN 16492).
