The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:52:44 UT on 13 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191113A (trigger 595345969.522208 / 191113578).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 298.1, Dec = 20.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 52m, 20d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.0 degrees.
