report:

The error box of GRB030414 (HETE 2679) was
observed with MASTER system (280mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru). We
obtained 50 measurements in R filter. Our observations started at Apr 14,
22:20 UT (8 hours after the GRB) and  had been lasting for 2.0 hours
up to Apr 15   00:30 UT (10 hours after  the  GRB).

There is no OT brighter than 13.3 - 14.5 (R-band) in different parts of
the error box. Transparency was quite poor due to low altitude of the
field above the horizont. Background level was high due to cirrus clouds
illuminated by Moon (almost full).

Our summarized fits-images are available at:
