collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 121226A (Krimm et al., GCN 14105) using
the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. We
obtained 3x600s R-band and 3x360s z-band images with their median time
of 06:14:49 UT on 2012-12-27 (i.e., 11.085 hr after the BAT trigger)
and 06:53:54 UT (i.e., 11.736 hr post-trigger), respectively.

No optical source was detected within the XRT error circle in both
R-and z-bands, down to a 3sigma limit of R~23.0 mag ,calibrated with
the USNO B1 catalogue.
