NUMBER:  146
SUBJECT: GRB980703 - BeppoSAX/GRBM detection
DATE:    98/07/17 20:30:24 GMT

L. Amati, F. Frontera (ITeSRE-CNR, Bologna), E. Costa, M. Feroci,
(IAS-CNR, Rome) report:

GRB980703 (BATSE trigger 6891) also triggered the BeppoSAX/GRBM units 1
and 4 on July 3 at 04:22:55.3 UT. On the basis of the RXTE/ASM
position of the GRB (BACODINE 6891), the GRB incoming direction on the
GRBM units is at large angles, 62 degrees and 105 degrees, from units 4
and 1 axis, respectively. The event is visible for 90 s in both units and
presents a double peak morphology. 
The 1 sec peak flux in the 40 - 700 keV energy range is 208 +/- 43
counts/s in unit 1 and 189 +/- 41 counts/s in unit 4. The estimated photon
peak flux is 4.7 +/- 0.9 photons cmE-2 sE-1 corresponding to 
(2.1 +/- 0.4) x 10E-6 erg cmE-2 sE-1. The fluence in the same energy band is 
(3 +/- 1) x 10E-5 erg cmE-2.
