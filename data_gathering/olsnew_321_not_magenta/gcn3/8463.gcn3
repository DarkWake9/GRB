the following:

OPTIMA-Burst at the 1.3m Skinakas Observatory, of the University of
Crete and the Foundation for Research and Technolgy -- Hellas observed
the location of the XRT error-circle of GRB 081102 (GCN Circ 8462, T. N.
Ukwatta et al.), starting at 2008-11-02 18:02:23 UT (~18 min after the
burst).

We did not detect any source inside the XRT error-circle in several
co-added short (10-50s) white-light target acquisition frames taken
under adverse conditions.

Our limit is as follows:

t-t_0 (mid-exp)       t_exp     limit (white light)
1276s                 210s      18.5

Observations are ongoing.
