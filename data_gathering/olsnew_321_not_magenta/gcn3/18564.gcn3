A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), S. B. Cenko (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:19:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151107A (trigger=662757).  Swift could not
slew to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 217.139, -59.680 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 14h 28m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 40' 46"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger,
the immediately-available BAT lightcurve shows no obvious activity. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:26 UT on 2015 December 12. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

We note that this location is within a degree of the Galactic plane,
so this may be a Galactic transient.  Further determination of the
nature of the source will require the full downlinked dataset. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
