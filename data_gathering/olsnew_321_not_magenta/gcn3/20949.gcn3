C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi, I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Gomboc 
(U. Nova Gorica), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath) on behalf of a large 
collaboration report:

We observed Swift GRB 170331A (Melandri et al. GCN 20946) on March 31, 
03:21 UT (1.7 hours since the GRB) with two 1-m LCO units in Sutherland 
(South Africa) with the SDSS i filter. We do not find any object within 
the prompt enhanced Swift-XRT error circle (Evans GCN 20948) down to 
i>17.5 mag (with an exposure of 2x120s) as calibrated against USNOB-1 
nearby stars.
