We have imaged a ca. 13 arcmin radius field around the WXM localization of
GRB031026 (Butler et al. GCN 2429), using the Max-Planck Millimeter
Bolometer array at the IRAM 30m telescope. We do not find any source
with a 250 GHz (1.2 mm) flux density >16 mJy (4 sigma upper limit)
within 10 armin of this position. The observations were conducted
between UT Oct 10.9 and Nov 2.2. Further details and maps can be found
at http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/staff/bertoldi/projects/grb031026

We wish to thank the IRAM staff for their flexibile scheduling of the
telescope, which made these observations possible.
