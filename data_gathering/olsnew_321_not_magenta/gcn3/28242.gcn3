Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), I. Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), M. D. Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ) and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New Zealand) gathered images covering the position of the position of the Swift/XRT X-ray afterglow of Fermi GRB 200809B (Fermi team. GCNC 28236). The first image (clear filter) was obtained starting at 09:58:18.81 UT 10th Aug (~ 18.4 hr after trigger). In the co-added image (5 exposures 60s each), no source is found at the position reported by Swift/XRT (Perri et al. GCNC 28241) down to 19.8 mag. Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
