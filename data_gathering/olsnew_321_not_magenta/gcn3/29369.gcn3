behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.6 ks of XRT data for the Fermi/LAT-detected burst
GRB 140104B, from 55.4 ks to 833.9 ks after the  Fermi/LAT trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The refined XRT
position is RA, Dec = 218.7543, -9.0282 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14 35 01.03
Dec(J2000): -09 01 41.5

with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 8.4 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020337.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
