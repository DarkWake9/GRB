TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 210527A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    21/05/27 08:40:43 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), G.
Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), S. Campana (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 210527A at 08:00:28.4 UT,
3159.5 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 172.32169,
31.62421 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 11h 29m 17.21s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 37' 27.2"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 104 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source
is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.85
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
