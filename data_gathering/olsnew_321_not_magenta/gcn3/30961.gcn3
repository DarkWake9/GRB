N. Di Lalla (Stanford Univ.), F. Longo (Univ. and INFN, Trieste) and M. Ohno (Hiroshima Univ. & Eotvos Univ) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration:


On October 23rd, 2021, Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 211023A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (trigger 656687148 / 211023546, GCN 30958). The best LAT on-ground location is found to be:


RA, Dec = 72.3, 85.3 (degrees, J2000)


with an error radius of 0.1 deg (90% containment, statistical error only).


The position was 54 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the GBM trigger:


T0 = 13:05:43 UT.


The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate after the trigger that is temporally and spatially correlated with the GBM emission with high significance. The photon flux above 100 MeV in the time interval 0-2500 s after the trigger is 3.4 (-/+ 0.6) e-06 ph/cm2/s.


The estimated photon index above 100 MeV is -1.8  (-/+ 0.1).


The highest-energy photon is a 8.6 GeV event which is observed at 1832 seconds after the GBM trigger.


A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.


The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Donggeun Tak (takdg123@gmail.com<mailto:takdg123@gmail.com>).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
