TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 100625A: Gemini candidate afterglow
DATE:    10/06/26 08:21:14 GMT
FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <A.J.Levan@warwick.ac.uk>

A.J. Levan (U. Warwick) and N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

"We observed the location of the short-hard GRB 100625A (Holland et
al. GCN 10884) using Gemini-South and GMOS under poor conditions
beginning at 06:50 UT. A total exposure time of 600s was obtained in 
the r-band.

Within the refined XRT localisation (Goad et al. GCN 10886) we find
a single source with r~23 (photometric calibration preliminary).
The location of the source is:

RA(J2000): 01:03:10.9 4
DEC(J2000): -39:05:18.7

with an error of approximately 0.5" in each axis. We suggest this
may be the afterglow of GRB 100625A, however, given the poor seeing
(2.5") we cannot distinguish between an afterglow or underlying host
galaxy.

Further observations are planned.

We thank the staff of Gemini South, in particular Fredrik Rantakyro,
for their assistance with these observations."
