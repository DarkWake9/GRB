A. N. Morgan, C. R. Klein, and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

We observed the field of GRB 110205A (Beardmore et al., GCN 11629)
with the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations
began at 2011-Feb-05 05h14m03s UT, ~3.2 hours after the Swift trigger.
 In  mosaics (effective exposure time of 0.50 hours) taken
simultaneously in the J, H, and Ks filters, we detect a source at the
position of the optical afterglow (Klotz et al., GCN 11630; Schaefer
et al., GCN 11631; Mundell et al., GCN 11633).

The preliminary photometry yields:

post burst
t_mid (hr) exp.(hr) filt  mag    m_err
3.59       0.50     J     16.74  0.05
3.59       0.50     H     15.81  0.05
3.59       0.50     Ks    15.19  0.07

All magnitudes are given in the Vega system, calibrated to 2MASS. No
correction for Galactic extinction has been made to the above reported
values.  Observations are continuing.
