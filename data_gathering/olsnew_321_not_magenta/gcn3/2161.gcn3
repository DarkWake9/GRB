   A.M.Finkelstein (IPA RAN), A.V.Ipatov(IPA RAN) and Yu.N.Gnedin (Pulkovo
Observatory) report:

GRB 030329 was observed at 3.5 cm with the RTF-32 telescope of the Institute
of Applied Astronomy in Svetloe on 2003 Apr 11 and 12 and at 6 cm with the
RTF-32 telescope of the Institute of Applied Astronomy in Zelenchuk on 2003
Apr 11,12 and 13. The observations in Svetloe have been made in both
polarization modes. The 3.5 cm following flux densities:
2003 Apr 11.18.12  27.1 +/- 7.8 mJy  in the right circular  polarization .
                    7.8 +/- 4.2 mJy  in the left circular polarization .
2003 Apr 11.16.47  30.4 +/- 9.7 mJy  in the right circular polarization.
                   18.7 +/- 4.7 mJy  in the left circular polarization.
2003 Apr 12.18.43  18.1 +/- 5.2 mJy  in the right circular polarization .
                    7.8 +/- 2.8 mJy  in the left circular polarization.
 Over the period of 6-cm observations in Zelenchuk the flux density at April
11 decreased from 179.6 +/- 4.4 mJy at 18.46 UT to 8.3 +/- 3.1 mJy at 22.48
UT. During Apr 12 and 13 the mean flux density was at the level of
approximately 10 mJy.
