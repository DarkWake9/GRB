On 2019 Oct 2 UT, we obtained spectra of ZTF19acbpqlh/AT2019rpn and
ATLAS19wyn/AT2019rpj (Stein et al. GCN 25899) with the Double Beam
Spectrograph on the Palomar 200-in telescope. For ATLAS19wyn, we
identify strong Balmer P-Cygni features at z~0.03 and classify as a
young Type II supernova. For ZTF19acbpqlh, we see a blue, mostly
featureless continuum with a tentative identification of a weak, broad
feature around H-alpha suggesting this may also be a core-collapse
supernova.
