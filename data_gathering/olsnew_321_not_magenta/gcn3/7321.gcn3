We made infrared photometry in J band at Mt. Abu 1.2 m Cassegrain telescope
using NICMOS camera on the GRB 080212 (Ziaeepour et al. GCN 7296)
during 2008 Feb 13 under good sky conditions. The H band magnitude was
earlier reported by P. D'Avanzo et. al (GCN 7310).
The calibration was made on the bright star SAO 183333.
The overall integration time and the magnitude along with the associated
error are given below:
UT           Integration time	J band magnitude+/-error
