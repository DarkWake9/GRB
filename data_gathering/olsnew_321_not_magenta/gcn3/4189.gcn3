K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the short GRB 051105 (Mineo et al. GCN 4188) was
observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope. The first frame
was acquired starting at 2005 November 5, 09:11 UT (2.8 hours after
the burst) and 60 s integration in Ic band was repeated.

 We do not identify an afterglow candidate within the BAT error circle
(GCN 4188) and derive the following 3 sigma upper limit relative to
USNO-B1.0 magnitude.
