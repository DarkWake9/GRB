report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:33:54.33 UT on 20 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201020B (trigger 624908039 / 201020732).
The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization was reported in GCN 28702.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 69 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows multiple peaks around
the bright, main peak.
The duration (T90) is about 16 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5.1 s to T0+23.5 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 136.9 +/- 3.4 keV,
alpha = -0.71 +/- 0.02, and beta = -2.20 +/- 0.03

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.929 +/- 0.040)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 43.7 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
