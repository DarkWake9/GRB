A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), O. Burhonov (UBAI), I. Molotov 
(KIAM) report on behalf GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed  the field of OT (Singer et al., GCN 14967) of GRB 130702А 
(= Fermi 394416326)(Cheung  et al., GCN 14971; Collazzi  et al., GCN 
14972) with AZT-22 telescope of Maidanak observatory  on Jul. 3 and Jul. 
4 under good weather conditions and seeing (FWHM) of about 1 arcsec.  We 
clearly detected  OT (Singer et al., GCN 14967) in each images of both 
epochs.

A preliminary photometry of combined images is based on the two SDSS 
stars suggested by Schulze et al. (GCN 14978), i.e.
SDSS J142915.86+154510.0 assuming R = 16.03
SDSS J142911.60+154535.2 assuming R = 15.59

T_start             T0+       Filter, Exposure, OT
(UT)                (mid, d)            (s)

2013-07-03T17:38:18 1.70828   R       6x600     18.69 +/- 0.03
2013-07-04T16:49:20 2.67427   R       6x300     19.31 +/- 0.04

We note that the fading  of a lc assuming  a power law  between our two 
epochs is alpha=1.27 which is steeper, than reported in early 
observations (Perley et al., GCN 14981).
