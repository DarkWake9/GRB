D. A. Smith (UMich), A. M. Levine, and R. Remillard (MIT), on behalf
of the RXTE/ASM teams at MIT and NASA/GSFC, and and K. Hurley (UCB)
and T. Cline (NASA/GSFC) on behalf of the NEAR GRB team, report:

The RXTE All-Sky Monitor has detected a gamma-ray burst, beginning at
about 03:10:05 UTC on 25 Oct 2000.  As recorded by the ASM, the light
curve consists of a single peak, lasting approximately 15-20 seconds.
The event was hard, as measured in the ASM, reaching a peak 5-12 keV
flux of ~4 Crab, and a 1.5-3 keV flux of ~1.5 Crab.  It was detected
in a single camera, yielding an error box with a length of 1.6 degrees
and a width of 4.0 arcminutes.  The center of the error box is at
R.A. = 8h38m, Decl. = -13o16'.0 (J2000.0).  The corners of the box are
at the locations:

130.2309d {08h40m55s} -13.6681d {-13o40'05"}
130.2542d {08h41m01s} -13.6247d {-13o37'29"}
128.7598d {08h35m02s} -12.8590d {-12o51'32"}
128.7357d {08h34m57s} -12.9034d {-12o54'12"}

NEAR also observed this burst.  As observed by NEAR, in the energy
range >~100 keV, and with 1 s resolution, the burst consisted of a
single one second long spike followed by weak emission for ~5 seconds.
A very coarse comparison of the NEAR and RXTE times gives an annulus
which contains, but does not improve upon the ASM error box.  Data
from the Konus-Wind and/or Ulysses experiments will be available
around 0600 UT on the 26th, and should result in a small RXTE/IPN
error box.
