report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have obtained a new XRT position, using the ground-based pipeline
processing software, including stellar aberration correction.  The analysis
is based on 4 different orbits and the source is detected each time. 
Although
in the last orbits we have only few counts the derived coordinates are very
consistent and differ by less than 5 arcseconds.

The new position for the X-ray afterglow is:

RA(J2000) = 18:32:27.0,
Dec(J2000) = +42 22 13.5

We estimate a remaining uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds, including a
systematic error of about 5 arcseconds due to residual alignment offsets
that have not been fully calibrated yet.
