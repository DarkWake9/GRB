on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"On September 30.18 UT (1.75 days after the burst) we observed the field 
of the Fermi/LAT GRB 140928A (Desiante et al. GCN 16847, Varela et al. 
GCN 16849) with the Gemini-South telescope equipped with the GMOS 
spectrograph. We obtain 2x1200s exposure under non optimal conditions 
(1.5-2 arcseconds seeing) with the R400 grating, covering the 6000-10000 
Angstrom wavelength range.

We detect a featureless continuum down to 6000A, no features are 
detected neither in emission nor in absorption.

We thank Cristiano Guidorzi for providing a finding chart and the Gemini 
staff for carry out this observations."
