A. Pozanenko (IKI), N. Pankov (HSE), V. Rumyantsev (CrAO),  S. Belkin 
(IKI), A. Volnova (IKI)  report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 201014A = (trigger=1000255) (Ambrosi et 
al., GCN 28623) with ZTSH 2.6m telescope of CrAO observatory starting on 
Oct. 14 (UT) 23:06:56,  i.e. 18.3 minutes after burst detection.  We 
detect an object at the edge of enhanced XRT afterglow position (Dâ€™Elia 
et al., GCN 28626). The coordinates of the object are (J2000) 01 23 
11.058 +27 39 38.39 with uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec in each 
coordinate.The object is absent in both SDSS DR12 and PS1 catalogues. We 
suggest the object is an optical afterglow GRB 201014A.

Preliminary photometry of the object in a combined image is following

The photometry is based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.
