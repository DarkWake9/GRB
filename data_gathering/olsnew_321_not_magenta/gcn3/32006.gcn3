of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the MAXI-detected
burst GRB 220506A (Urabe et al. GCN Circ. 32001) in a series of
observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 1.2 ks,
distributed over 6 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location
was 463 s. The data were collected between T0+38.2 ks and T0+55.6 ks,
and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected and is above the RASS 3-sigma
upper limit at this position, and is therefore likely the GRB
afterglow.  The position of this source is RA, Dec=239.7257, -26.4186
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 15:58:54.18
Dec(J2000): -26:25:06.9

with an uncertainty of 7.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 15.0 arcmin from the MAXI position.  We cannot determine at
the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
are at https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00105/Source1.php.

The results of the full analysis of the tiled XRT observations are
available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00105.
