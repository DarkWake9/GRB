A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), E. Mazaeva (IKI), P. Minaev (IKI), 
M. Krugov (AFIF) report on behalf of IKI-GW follow-up collaboration:

We continue observation of  the possible counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck 
(Coulter et al. GCN 21529;  Yang et al., GCN 21531) of LIGO/Virgo 
trigger G298048 (GCNs 21509, 21513)  with RC-1000 telescope of 
CHILESCOPE observatory. The observations carried out in clear filter 
starting on Aug. 21  (UT) 23:32:09.

Preliminary Photometry of the transient SSS17a/DLT17ck is following

Date       UT start  MJD          Filter  OT   Err UpLim (3 sigma)

2017-08-21 23:32:09  57987.00386  CR      18.8 0.2 22.2

The photometry is based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2). The 
photometry  is still preliminary and required  careful estimation of 
NGC4339 influence.

We are grateful for the team of remote controlled CHILESCOPE observatory 
(www.chilescope.com) for observations.
