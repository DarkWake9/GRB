V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of Astrosat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 180724A, which was also detected by Insight-HXMT/HE (Nang Y. et al., GCN 23038).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows a single peak of emission with peak at 19:22:37.5 UT. The measured peak count rate is 585 cts/s above the background in combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 8613 cts. The local mean background count rate was 673.9 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 30.3 s. In preliminary analysis, we find that 786 compton events are associated with this event.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
