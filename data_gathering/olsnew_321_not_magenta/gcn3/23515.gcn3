We observed the localization region of the short GRB181126B (trigger
564897175) detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi
satellite with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the 47 square
degree Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera. We obtained two sets of 180
second r-band images covering 1400 square degrees beginning at 5:15 UT on
2018 November 26 (1 hour and 23 minutes after the burst trigger time).
Accounting for area lost to processing failures, this corresponds to
analyzing 66% of the probability enclosed. Beginning at 6:06 UT on 2018
November 27 we observed the updated IPN localization with ZTF using 300
second r-band exposures. The observations covered 709 square degrees. Once
again accounting for processing failures, 77% of the enclosed probability
was analyzed.

The images were processed through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction
pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts. 394
high-significance transient and variable candidates were identified by our
pipeline in the area observed,  most (383) of which had previous detections
with ZTF in the days and weeks prior to the GRB trigger time (e.g.,
supernovae, active galactic nuclei, CV).

Further follow-up of 11 transients was obtained with the Kitt Peak EMCCD
Demonstrator (KPED) on the Kitt Peak 84-inch telescope on November 28.
Additionally, we obtained follow-up spectroscopy of 6 candidates with the
Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on Keck I, the nights of
December 1 and December 3. The candidates are listed below, however no
photometric evolution or spectral classification was consistent with an
optical counterpart.

*Classification from photometric data points.

The median 5-sigma upper limit for an isolated point source in ZTF images
was r > 20.5 mag for the observations made on November 26 and r > 21.1 mag
for the observations made on November 27.
