Y.-D. Hu, X.-Y.Li, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. Ayala, A. J. Castro-Tirado 
(IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de 
Malaga), and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a larger collaboration, 
report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) responded to the Swift ground-detected burst GRB 190331B (Page 
et al. GCNC 24041) ~2.36 day after the burst. The first images (clear 
filter) were obtained starting on April 2, 12:39 UT. At the uncatalogued 
X-ray source position found by Swift/XRT, no optical afterglow is 
detected down to 20.3 mag on a 900s co-added image, in agreement with 
the non-detection by Swift/UVOT.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
