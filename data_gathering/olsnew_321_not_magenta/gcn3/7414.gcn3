P. Garnavich (Notre Dame), J. L. Prieto, R. Pogge (OSU) report:

Beginning March 12.48 (UT), we again observed the position of
GRB 080310 (Chornock et al. GCN 7381; Cummings et al., GCN 7382)
with the Large Binocular Telescope and LBC red and blue cameras.
The seeing was 0.7 arcsec in the r-Sloan filter.

The brightness of the afterglow 2.12 days after the burst is measured
to be r=21.67+/-0.05 mag, or only 0.3 mag fainter than the previous
night. This corresponds to a power-law decay index of only 0.42
and confirms the slowing in the decay rate noted in GCN 7409.

It is unlikely that the slow fade is due to contamination from
a host galaxy or a galaxy along the line of sight. To explain the
observed decay rate, a galaxy would have to contribute at a
magnitude near r=22.5, but nothing at this brightness is detected
in the SDSS at the position of the afterglow. Also, the afterglow is
consistent with a point source in the LBT images obtained in good seeing.

We conclude that the shallow decay rate is intrinsic to the afterglow
and this suggests either a continuing energy input or that the shock has
encountered a change in density of the ambient medium. (We must note
another possibility: the afterglow is being gravitationally
microlensed.)
