We have analysed 14.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 130807A (Melandri et al.  
GCN Circ. 15082), from 88 s to 80 ks after the  BAT trigger. The XRT  
position for this burst is RA, Dec = 269.8007, -27.6159 which is  
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 17h 59m 12.16s
Dec (J2000): -27d 36' 57.5"

with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

In the first orbit (WT mode) the source is initially detected at a  
rate of ~10 XRT count/s, rising to ~100 c/s at the end of the first  
orbit. During this period the spectrum can be fit by an absorbed power- 
law model with a photon index of 1.56 +/- 0.08. The source showed an  
absorption column of (8.6 +/- 1.0) x 10^21 cm^-2, slightly in excess  
with respect to the Galactic value of 6 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.  
2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion  
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 8.0 x 10^-11 (1.2 x 10^-10) erg  
cm^-2 count^-1.

In the second orbit (PC mode) the source had become much fainter  
(~0.03 c/s), and much softer, with a photon index of 2.3 (+0.5,  
-0.4).The source still showed an absorption column (9.0 +/- 5.0 x  
10^21 cm^-2) consistent with the Galactic value. The counts to  
observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from  
this spectrum  is 5.0 x 10^-11 (1.7 x 10^-10) erg cm^-2 count^-1.  
Starting with the second orbit, the light curve rose from a count rate  
of ~0.015 c/s after ~4 ks to a maximum of ~0.06 c/s at ~10 ks (with  
slope of -1.5 +/- 0.1). After that it decayed with a slope of 0.9 +/-  
0.1, reaching the count rate of ~0.012 c/s at ~75 ks.

The light curve behaviour (at late times) is unusual, but not  
unprecedented, for a GRB. The BAT and XRT spectral indices are similar  
to those observed for GRB 060124 (BAT spectrum gamma = 1.89 +/- 0.19,  
XRT-WT spectrum gamma = 1.40+/-0.01, XRT-PC spectrum gamma =  
2.1+/-0.1; Romano et al., 2006, A&A, 456, 917) and for the transient  
supermassive black hole Swift J1644+57 (Burrows et al., 2011, Nature,  
476, 421), but inconsistent with what generally observed for a  
Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient. The dynamical range of GRB 130807A  
(~3300) is similar to what observed for GRB 060124 or for a typical  
SFXT, but very different from what was observed for Swift J1644+57.

The source was not detected in the BAT transient monitor (15-50 keV)  
before 3:03 UT, August 6, 2013, the most recent monitor epoch  
currently available. Events like Swift J1644+57 or SFXTs are usually  
detected in X-rays for several days before the trigger, Swift J1644+57  
behaved similarly. It is therefore likely that BAT trigger 565651 was  
a somewhat unusual GRB rather than a Galactic or extragalactic  
transient, in spite of its proximity to the Galactic center.
