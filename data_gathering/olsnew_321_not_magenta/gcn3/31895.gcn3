report:

A short-duration, soft GRB 220406A
was detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Mars-Odyssey (HEND), and Swift (BAT) at about 1661 s UT (00:27:41).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
 ---------------------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
 ---------------------------------------------
 Center:
  324.994 (21h 39m 59s) +64.925 (+64d 55' 31")
 Corners:
  330.496 (22h 01m 59s) +64.859 (+64d 51' 31")
  319.682 (21h 18m 44s) +64.833 (+64d 49' 59")
  319.519 (21h 18m 04s) +64.773 (+64d 46' 21")
  330.308 (22h 01m 14s) +64.812 (+64d 48' 43")
 ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 882 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 4.7 deg (the minimum one is 3 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 66 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
