report:

The optical counterpart of GRB 080205 (Li et al., GCN 7251) was observed
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey). We made two sets of BVRI images on Feb 05
approximately at 18:00 and 22:00 UT (10 and 14 hours after the burst). The
afterglow is detected near the limit of our images, i.e. near about R=23.5
(USNO B1.0 calibrated), in agreement with later INT observation (Rol and
Anderson, GCN 7258).
