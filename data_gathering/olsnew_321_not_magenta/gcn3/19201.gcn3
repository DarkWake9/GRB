E. Mazaeva (IKI),  A. Volnova (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP),  I. Korobtsev 
(ISTP),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of the GRB 160313A (D'Ai et al., GCN  19171) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy)  starting on March, 13 
(UT) 16:39:40.  We do not detect any source within enhanced Swift-XRT 
position (Goad et al., GCN 19174). Preliminary photometry  of  the 
combined image is following

2016-03-13  16:39:40  0.60586  R       30*120  23.6

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars, Lupton transformations into R.

The nearest source to the enhanced XRT position is 5.5 arcsec East, in 
coordinates (J2000) 12:15:11.86 +57:17:00.0 with uncertainty of 0.5 
arcsec in both coordinates. The source magnitude is R=23.3+/-0.2. The 
source is not presented in SDSS-DR9 but barely visible in SDSS r-image.
