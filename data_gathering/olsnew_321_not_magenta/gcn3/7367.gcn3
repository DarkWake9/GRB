SUBJECT: GRB 080307: retraction of UVOT candidate

P. Schady (MSSL/UCL) and S. T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) report on 
behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

There was a typo in the position for the optical afterglow candidate 
for GRB 080307 reported by Holland et al., (GCN 7362), and this should, 
in fact, be

    RA(J2000.0) =  09:06:25.5
    Dec(J2000.0) = +35:08:29

with an estimated uncertainty of 1 arcsec. However, we note that the 
new UVOT position is 0.2" from a known source, and is therefore 
unlikely to be the optical afterglow of GRB 080307.
