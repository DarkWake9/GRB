The long GRB 160712A (Swift/BAT observation: Hagen et al., GCN 19684)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=71621.420 s UT (19:53:41.420).

The light curve statrs with a short spike followed
by a gradually decaying emission.
The total duration of the burst is ~25 s.
The emission is seen up to ~4 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(6.5 ± 2.0)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 64-ms peak energy flux,
measured from T0+0.128, of (2.7 ± 0.8)x10^-6 erg/cm2
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range by a cutoff power-law
(CPL) function with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.17(-0.57,+0.87),
and the peak energy Ep = 460(-117,+204) keV,
chi2 = 72/73 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields
the same alpha and Ep with only an upper limit on beta of -2.3,
chi2 = 72/72 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
