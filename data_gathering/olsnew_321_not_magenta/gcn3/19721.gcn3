L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 160716A
88 s after the BAT trigger (Hagen et al., GCN Circ. 19716). A source
consistent with the XRT position (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 19717) is
detected in the initial UVOT exposures in the white filter. The source
has marginal evidence for fading but is not seen in the Digitized Sky
Survey (DSS), so it is unclear at this time whether it is the optical
afterglow. Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the
UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358,
373) for the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the large, but uncertain, reddening of E(B-V) = 1.47 in the
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
