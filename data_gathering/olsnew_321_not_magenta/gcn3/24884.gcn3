The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 12:36:48 UT on 26 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190626B (trigger 583245413.943206 / 190626526).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 188.0, Dec = 38.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 31m, 38d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 25.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 23.0 degrees.
