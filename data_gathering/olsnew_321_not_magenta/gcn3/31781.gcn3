Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220319A (trigger #1098132)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 31769).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 218.139, 61.291 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 32m 33.4s
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 17' 26.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 43%.

The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.44 +- 1.54 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.36 to T+6.56 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.15 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
