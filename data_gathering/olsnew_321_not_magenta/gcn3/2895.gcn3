TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2895
SUBJECT: GRB 041219: Second Epoch WSRT Radio Observations
DATE:    04/12/22 16:41:00 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam), E. Rol (University of
Leicester) and R. Strom (ASTRON, University of Amsterdam) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the INTEGRAL GRB 041219 (GCN 2866) at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on December 21 from 14.45 to 23.55
UT, i.e. 2.54 - 2.93 days after the burst.
Compared to our previous measurement (GCN 2894), the average flux density
has increased to 349 +/- 22 microJy.
Assuming a power law behaviour, the average temporal index at 4.9 GHz
between this and our previous observation is alpha ~ 1.2.

Further observations are planned."
