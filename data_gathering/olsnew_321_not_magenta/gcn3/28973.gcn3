Swift observed the field of IceCube 201130A (GCN Circ. 28969) between 20:52:42
2020 November 30 and 22:53:21 on 2020 November 30, collecting a total of 3.8 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found 2 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are known X-ray
sources consistent with catalogued fluxes. We therefore do not claim any of
them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 201130A.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 4-7 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:

Source no:   1
RA (J2000):  30.47644 [degrees] = 02h 01m 54.34s
Dec (J2000): -11.8212 [degrees] = -11d 49' 16.3"
Error:       +4.4 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 7.7 (+3.8, -2.9) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       3.3 (+1.6, -1.2) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1
Note: This source may be affected by optical loading.
Note: This source matches SIMBAD source HD12460.

RA (J2000):  30.48834 [degrees] = 02h 01m 57.20s
Dec (J2000): -11.5423 [degrees] = -11d 32' 32.2"
Error:       +2.2 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 0.117 (+/-0.013) ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       5.0 (+/-0.5) x 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1
Note: This source matches SIMBAD source ICRF J020157.1-113233
