We observed the field of ZTF21aayokph (AT2021lfa) (Yao, Perley, & Ho, 
GCN 29938) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. We obtained 6x300 s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 
19:35:55 UT on 2021-05-05, i.e., ~ 38.02 hr after the ZTF detection in 
r-band.

The optical transient is not detected in our stacked image, down to a 
limiting magnitude of r ~ 21.2, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
