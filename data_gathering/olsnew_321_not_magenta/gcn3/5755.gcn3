G. Tosti, F. Vitali, P. Conconi, L.A. Antonelli, G. Cutispoto, G. 
Malaspina, L. Nicastro, E. Palazzi, E. Meurs, and P. Goldoni report on 
behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 061025 (Mereghetti et al. GCN 5751) with the 
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). A first set  of 
observations was performed automatically in the optical and near infrared 
(V,R,I and z', J, H, K bands) starting on October 25 23:56 UT.

No obvious candidate is visible in our set of images in the XRT error box 
(Mineo et al. GCN 5753). In the NIR we report the following limiting 
magnitudes (3sigma level):

J > 16.0
H > 15.6
K > 14.6

In particular, no candidate is seen at the position reported by Berger 
(GCN 5754).
