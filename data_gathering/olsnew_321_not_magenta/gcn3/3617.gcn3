Russian-Turkish telescope (RTT150, Antalya, Turkey).
    The set of 30 sec exposures has been made with total exposure
time of 15 min and midpoint at UT = 22h 26min (~ 22 hours after
the burst). No new optical source was detected at the position of the 
X-ray source in the co-added frame with limiting magnitude of Rc = 22.4 mag.
