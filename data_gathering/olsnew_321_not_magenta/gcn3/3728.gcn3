B. Monard (Bronberg Observatory) reports on behalf
of the AAVSO International High Energy Network:

We observed the afterglow (Rykoff et. al., GCN 3723) for
the Swift burst GRB 050801 (Band et al., GCN 3725), using
the 30cm telescope plus ST-7XME CCD camera of Bronberg
Observatory.  Using the UCAC2 star at 13:36:40.87
-21:55:58.6 as having a derived Rc magnitude of 14.5,
we obtain the following photometry:

UT / CR mag
19:03.0  17.5
19:05.5  17.7
19:08.0  17.9
19:10.5  18.1
19:14.5  18.4:

Uncertainty in timing : 30sec absolute, 10 sec relative
Uncertainty in magnitude : 0.3 in accuracy, 0.1 in precision

No further observations are planned.
