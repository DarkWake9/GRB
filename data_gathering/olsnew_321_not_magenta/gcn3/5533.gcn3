P.Kubanek (AsU AV CR Ondrejov, ISDC Versoix) reports:

The object mentioned in GCN Circ.5530 is:

- outside XRT and BAT location
- show second object roughly 10 arcmin apart (~27m @ 10km)

so it is most probably airplane. This object is not related to GRB 060906.

I apologize for error in position determination - I forget to switch from BAT arcmin error box to XRT arcsec error box when I plot localizations. I thank to S.B.Cenko for pointing that out.
