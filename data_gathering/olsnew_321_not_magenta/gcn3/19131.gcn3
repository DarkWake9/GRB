We observed the field of GRB 160303A (Beardmore, et al., GCN 19126) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/03 3.46 to 2016/03 3.52 UTC (1.8
minutes to 1.50 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.02
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.44 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

We detect an uncatalogued source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in
comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r = 22.95 +/- 0.31
  i = 22.65 +/- 0.23
  Z > 21.98
  Y = 21.83 +/- 0.36
  J > 21.30
  H > 21.01

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source is located at RA, Dec =
11:14:48.12, +22:44:32.6 (J2000, +/-0.5").

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
