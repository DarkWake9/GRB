INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Helicon/Coronas-F
observed this GRB at 20324 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 10 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  4.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 338.090, -41.009 degrees, whose radius is 77.935 +/-  0.021
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
