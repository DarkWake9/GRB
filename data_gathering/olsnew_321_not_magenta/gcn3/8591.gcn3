F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and J. Mao (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of Swift trigger 335971 
on Nov. 29, 2008, starting 141 s after 
the BAT trigger (Mao et al., GCN Circ. 8582).
Ground analysis of the BAT data indicates that this trigger
was probably not due to a real source (Cummings and Mao, 
GCN Circ. 8583). No new source is seen inside the BAT
error circle (Cummings and Mao, GCN Circ. 8583) in
any of the individual or summed UVOT exposures.

The 3-sigma upper limits in the UVOT photometric system 
(Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) are:

The values quoted above are not corrected for the Galactic extinction due
to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.10 in the direction of the burst 
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
