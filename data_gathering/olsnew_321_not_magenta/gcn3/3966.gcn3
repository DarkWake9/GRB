E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and A. Boss (Carnegie DTM) report:

"We observed the BAT error circle of GRB 050911 (GCN #3961) with the du
Pont 100-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory on 2005, Sep. 12.125
UT (13 hours after the burst).  A total of 16 minutes were obtained in
I-band with a seeing of about 0.9".  A comparison to DSS reveals no new
objects to the limit of the survey."
