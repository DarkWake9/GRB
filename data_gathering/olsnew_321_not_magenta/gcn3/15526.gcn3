We observed the field of GRB 131127A detected by Swift (trigger #579571; 
Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 15516) with the 12-inch AGU Robotic Optical 
Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N) located at the Sagamihara 
campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.  

60 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from 
November 27 10:42:18 (UT) about 30 minutes after the trigger and 
stopped on November 27 11:48:15 (UT).  We do not detect the optical 
afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked image, which 
combined 57 good quality images, inside the enhanced XRT position 
(Evans, et al., GCN #15520).  The estimated five sigma upper limit of 
the combined image (total exposure of 3420 sec) is ~16.6 mag using 
the USNO-B1 catalog.
