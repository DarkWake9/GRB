At 18:43:00.00 UTC (67380.00 s UT) on 21 Oct 2002, the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments detected a faint, untriggered XRF.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a location,
which was reported in a GCN Notice at 10:58:44 UT on 22 Oct 2002,
about 16 hours after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 6.
The WXM location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that
is 20 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 17m 23s, Dec = -01d 37' 00" (J2000).

In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~13 seconds.
The spectrum of the burst is soft, making estimates of its peak
flux and fluence uncertain.
