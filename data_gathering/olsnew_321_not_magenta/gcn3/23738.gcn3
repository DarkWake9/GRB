This report is an errata version for GCN 23731.
The time duration between the initial alert and observing time at Deokheung
Optical Astronomy Observatory was changed from '0.2 hours' to '12.3 hours.'

We observed the afterglow of GRB 190114A(LaPorte et al., GCN 23677; Siegel
et al., GCN 23678; Evans et al., GCN 23679; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN
23680; Evans et al., 23681; Bolmer et al., GCN 23682; D'Avanzo et al., GCN
23683; Barthelmy et al., GCN 23685; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 23687;
Selsing et al. GCN 23697) with the 1.0m telescope at the Deokheung Optical
Astronomy Observatory and the 1.0m telescope at the Lemonsan Optical
Astronomical Observatory.
The observation at the Deokheung Optical Astronomy Observatory started at
about 12.3 hours after the initial alert and the observation at the
Lemonsan Optical Astronomy Observatory started at about 24.7 hours after
the initial alert.
We did not find any positive signal at both observations and obtained
following preliminary 3 sigma upper limits.

LOAO        58498.660   R           120*15    >20.3

The photometry is based on nearby APASS stars, Blaton transformation
(Blaton et al. 2007).

Further observations and analysis are being carried out
