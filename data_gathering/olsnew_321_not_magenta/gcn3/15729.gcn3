S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:  

We imaged the location of GRB140114A (Troja et al., GCN 15728) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations were obtained in the r', i', and z' filter beginning at 12:01 UT on 2014 January 14 (~ 3 minutes after the Swift trigger).  The seeing was relatively poor throughout the observations (~ 3").  

We do not detect any emission at the location of the XRT counterpart.  Using several nearby point sources from SDSS for reference, we calculate the following upper limits in coadded images:  

i' > 20.8 mag at a mean epoch of dt ~ 14 min  
r' > 21.2 mag at a mean epoch of dt ~ 15 min
z' > 20.0 mag at a mean epoch of dt ~ 16 min
