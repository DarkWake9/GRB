Mars Odyssey (HEND), Konus-Wind, HETE (FREGATE and WXM), and RHESSI
observed this burst.  Ulysses was off.  HETE Ground Analysis produced
two error circles for it, distributed as GCN Notices Sequence 3 and 4.
The burst occurred after HETE sunrise, at orbital phase=0.78, just as
the science instruments were being shut off; as a result, HETE observed
only the precursor to this long, intense event (GCN 2641, Aptekar et
al.).  The HETE star trackers were also off at the time of the burst,
so spacecraft aspect could only be established crudely using the
spacecraft sun sensors.


We have triangulated this burst to two annuli, whose coordinates are
RA, Decl = 332.624, -12.452 degrees, with radius 34.105 +/-0.014
degrees, and RA, Decl = 309.285, -21.748 degrees, with radius 46.199
+/- 1.815 degrees (3 sigma values).  These annuli intersect to form an
error box whose area is ~780 sq. arcmin., and whose corners are given
by:

RA	    Decl.
  2.438  -33.023
357.554  -38.402
  2.438  -32.967
357.562  -38.353

The larger of the two IPN annuli encompasses parts of both HETE
WXM error circles.  The smaller annulus, however, intersects the
larger WXM error circle in Sequence Number 3, but not the smaller
one given in Sequence Number 4.  The intersection forms an error
box whose area is ~90 sq. arcmin., and whose corners are given
by:

RA        Decl.
359.134  -36.959
359.716  -36.366
359.002  -37.043
359.788  -36.244
