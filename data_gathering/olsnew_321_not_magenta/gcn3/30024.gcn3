Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the two recently reported AMON IC-HAWC coincidence alert NuEm-210515A and  NuEm-210515B (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/30010.gcn3).

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were detected within 3 degrees from the two coincidence coordinates over a time period [21h15 - 00h20 (+1) UTC] corresponding to 49.5% of the HAWC transit time mentioned in the AMON notice, during which the potential source remained visible in the up-going field of view of ANTARES. 

This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon neutrino radiant fluence from a point source located at the coordinates of the coincidence as reported by AMON, of about 15 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 5 TeV - 4 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and about 30 GeV.cm^-2 (1 - 400 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. These indicative limits have been computed for the end of the HAWC transit time.

A search over an extended time window of +/-1 day has also yielded no detection (42% visibility). 

ANTARES (https://antares.in2p3.fr) is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
