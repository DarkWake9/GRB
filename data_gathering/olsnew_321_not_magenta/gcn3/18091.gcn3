Using the data set from T-240 to T+946 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150728A (trigger #650617)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 18087).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 292.271, 33.906 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 29m 05.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 54' 20.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T_zero
and ending at ~T+1.5 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.83 +- 0.23 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.24 to T+1.20 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.02 +- 0.48.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.3 +- 1.0 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
