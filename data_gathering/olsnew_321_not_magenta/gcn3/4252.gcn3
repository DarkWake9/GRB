NUMBER:  4252
SUBJECT: GRB051111: Super-LOTIS Early Detection

P. Milne, G. Williams (U. of Arizona), H. S. Park (LLNL), S. Barthelmy 
(GSFC), J. Crist-Lair (Clemson U) , report on behalf of the Super-LOTIS 
collaboration.

The 0.6m automated Super-LOTIS telescope, located at Steward Observatory's 
Kitt Peak site, responded to Swift trigger 163438, GRB051111A.  The first 
image began at 06:00:17.4 UT, 35.9 s after the burst.  We clearly detect 
the OT identified by W. Rujopakarn et al. (GCN 4247) and find that it has 
faded considerably in images taken 15 minutes after the burst.  The 
approximate R band magnitude in the first 10 second exposure was 
determined using the USNO B1 catalog.

Observations and analysis are continuing.
