O. Godet (U Leicester) and S. Oates (UCL-MSSL) on behalf the Swift-XRT 
team:

The Swift-XRT started observing the field of GRB 081121 (trigger number
335105, Oates et al., GCN Circ. 8537) at 2008-11-21 20:35:32 UT, 2.8 ks 
after the trigger. The best XRT position is the UVOT-enhanced position 
reported by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 8541). This position is consistent with 
the optical positions reported by the Swift-UVOT and ROTSE III (Oates et 
al., GCN Circ. 8538; Yuan et al., GCN Circ. 8536).

The X-ray light curve presently spans 4.2 ks of photon counting (PC) mode 
data from T+2.8 ks to T+16 ks. The light curve shows an initial decay with 
a slope of 1.11 +0.06/-0.05 up to at least ~T+17 ks, followed by a steep 
decay up to ~T+20 ks and then a flatter decay with a slope of 0.25 
+0.62/-0.13.

The PC X-ray spectrum from the same interval can be well fit by an absorbed
power-law with a photon index of 1.99 +0.10/-0.09 and a column density of 
(9.7 +2.2/-2.0) x 10^20 cm^-2 (the Galactic value is 4.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 in 
the direction of the burst).  The observed 0.3-10.0 keV flux is (7.1 
+/-0.4) x 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 which corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 
(9.0 +0.2/-0.5) x 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

If the burst continues on the current plateau phase, the predicted count 
rate at T+1 day would be approximately 1.2 x 10^-1 count s^-1.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
