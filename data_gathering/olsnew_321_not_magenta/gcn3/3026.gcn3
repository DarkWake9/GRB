The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of 
GRB050215b (GCN 3024) on February 15, 2005 at 02:35:10 UT.  We detect no 
source down to a magnitude of 19.5 in the V-filter for a 100 second 
exposure 1747s after the BAT trigger.  No source was detected in the other 
UVOT filters.  The limiting magnitudes in each of the UVOT filters are as 
follows:

  UVW2 = No source identified down to 19.2 (3-sigma) for a 10 second 
exposure @ 88 seconds after the burst
  UVM2 = No source identified down to 21.3 (3-sigma) for a 100 second 
exposure @ 1853 seconds after the burst
  UVW1 = No source identified down to 20.2 (3-sigma) for a 100 second 
exposure @ 1959 seconds after the burst
  U = No source identified down to 19.8 (3-sigma) for a 100 second exposure 
@ 2065 seconds after the burst
  B = No source identified down to 19.9 (3-sigma) for a 100 second exposure 
@ 2171 seconds after the burst
  V = No source identified down to 19.5 (3-sigma) for a 100 second exposure 
@ 1747 seconds after the burst

We caution that the instrument is not yet fully calibrated and that the 
magnitude limits presented here may need to be refined at a future date.
