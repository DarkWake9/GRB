E. Berger (Harvard), A. Cucchiara, D.B. Fox (Penn State), and A.J. Levan 
(U. Warwick) report:

"On 2009 June 22.41 UT we used the GMOS instrument mounted on the 
Gemini-North 8-m telescope to obtain spectroscopic observations of the 
candidate optical afterglow (GCN #9547) of the short GRB 090621B (GCN 
#9545).  A pair of 1800 sec exposures were obtained with a wavelength 
coverage of 4500-7500A.  The combined spectrum of the source reveals 
broad features typical of an early M dwarf star.  We therefore conclude 
that this object is unrelated to the GRB."
