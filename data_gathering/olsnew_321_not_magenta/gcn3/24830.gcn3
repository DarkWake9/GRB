The long, bright GRB 190611B (Fermi GBM detection: Malacaria and Meegan,
GCN Circ. 24794; IPN Triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 24811; BALROG
localization: Kunzweiler et al., GCN Circ. 24813) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 22:47:46.257 UTC on 11 June 2019.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows two multi-peaked pulses: the first starts
at T+2.8 sec, peaks at T+4.9 sec and ends at T+16.9 sec, the second starts
at T+67.4 sec, peaks at T+75.4 sec and ends at T+118.8 sec. The T90 and
T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 100.9 +- 3.9 sec and
13.9 +- 1.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
