C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi, I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Gomboc 
(U. Nova Gorica), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath) on behalf of a large 
collaboration report:

We observed Swift GRB 170330A (D'Avanzo et al. GCN 20944) on March 31, 
07:00 UT (8.5 hours since the GRB) with one 1-m LCO unit in Cerro Tololo 
with the SDSS i filter. Comparing with the PanSTARRS archive data, 
within the XRT error circle we do not find any new/variable source down 
to i>20.5 mag (with a total exposure of 10x120s at 8.7 hours mid time) 
as calibrated against nearby PanSTARRS sources.
