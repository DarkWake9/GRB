Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141121A (trigger #619182)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 17075).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 122.665, 22.206 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  08h 10m 39.5s
    Dec(J2000) = +22d 12' 22.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 32%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a very broad multi-peaked structure with the 
first emission episode running from T-50 to T+450 sec, with at least four 
superimposed peaks.  Then there is a return to baseline followed by another 
episode from T+550 to T+675 sec. The spacecraft slewed away from the burst 
position at around T+825 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 549.9 +- 37.4 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+46.54 to T+663.07 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.73 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.3 +- 0.4 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+230.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
