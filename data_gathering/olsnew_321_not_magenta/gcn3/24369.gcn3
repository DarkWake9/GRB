+Zhang (IHEP), report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

We performed small area scan survey of the LIGO localization region with Insight-HXMT after the LVC trigger S190425z (LVC et al. GCN
+24168). The observation started at 2019-4-25 16:28 UTC, about 8 hours after the trigger time. Four fields were visited, with
+overlaps, mapping 987.2 square degrees of the bayestar map 90% credible region and covering a sky region totalling of 20.4% of the
+LIGO localization likelihood. Each field was scanned twice and the total exposure time was 79.2 ks. No significant new source is
+found in the region in search of the Insight-HXMT raw light curves.


The survey also covered T2019ebq/PS19qp (Smith et al. GCN, 24210), a possible optical counterpart to S190425z, at 2019-04-26 02:12
+UTC (for 400s) and 2019-04-26 15:06 UTC (for 250s). We find no significant new X-ray sources in the data. The 5-sigma flux upper
+limits are obtained when fitting the light curves to the position of T2019ebq/PS19qp: 6.8 mCrab (HE：25-100 keV), 16.2 mCrab
+(ME：7-40 keV) and 5.2 mCrab (LE：1-6 keV). The flux upper limits for other positions in the scanned fields are about the same as
+quoted above.

Further analysis will be reported in the following circulars.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA)
+and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information could be found at: http://www.hxmt.org.
