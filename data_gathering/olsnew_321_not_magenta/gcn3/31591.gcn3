report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:07:48.88 UT on 11 February 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220211A (trigger 666234473 / 220211047),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 31852).

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization was reported in GCN 31570.

The GBM light curve consists of a single short pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-64 ms to T0+128 ms is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with index -1.42 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.28 +/- 0.19)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-64 ms in the 10-1000 keV band
is 12.8 +/- 2.7 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
