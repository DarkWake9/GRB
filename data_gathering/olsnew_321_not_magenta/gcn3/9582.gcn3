Fazio (SAO/Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"As part of the IRAC Warm Instrument Characterization Campaign (IWIC), 
we observed the field of the z=8.3 GRB090423 (GCN 9198) for 72 hours 
using Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 microns.  The observations took place between 
2009 June 5.01 and 10.81 UT, corresponding to about 46 days after the 
burst in the observer frame, or about 5 days in the rest-frame.  We 
detect a weak source at the location of the near-IR afterglow (Tanvir et 
al. 2009 arXiv:0906.1577), confirmed through an astrometric tie to the 
Gemini-North near-IR images.  Aperture-corrected photometry of the 
source results in a 3.6 micron flux density of 46+/-17 nJy (or 
27.2+/-0.3 AB mag).  The spectral energy distribution and power-law 
decay of the afterglow presented in Tanvir et al. 2009 predicts a 3.6 
micron flux density of ~27.3 AB mag at the time of our observations.  
The detected source is thus consistent with being the afterglow.

Light colors designate bright flux, dark colors are faint.  The pixel 
scale in the IRAC image (left) is 0.4"/pixel.  The right-hand image is 
the Gemini J-band image from Cucchiara et al. (GCN 9209).  The red 
circles are 1" radius and show the position of the afterglow.

Further analysis is ongoing, and a second epoch of observations is 
planned for February 2010 to assess the contribution of an
underlying host galaxy to the measured flux."
