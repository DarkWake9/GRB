R. Chornock, W. Li, A. V. Filippenko, and S. Jha (UC Berkeley) report:

We imaged a 6.8' x 6.8' field centered at the position of GRB 030131
(GCN 1836) with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) starting
at 11:12:23 UT, 3.6 hours after the burst.  Visual comparison of a single
300s unfiltered exposure to the Digitized Sky Survey shows no new object
down to a limiting magnitude of about 19.5.
