The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely Long GRB.

At 06:03:22 UT on 19 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200619C (trigger 614239407 / 200619252). The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 225.15, Dec = -10.39 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 01m, -10d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees. The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 24.0 degrees.
