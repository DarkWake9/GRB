and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S200224ca T0 = 2020-02-24 22:22:34.406 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 27184), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-18 min to T0+1 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high 
energy trigger mode at the trigger time of S200224ca. Using
the CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in the
10-100 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger 
time and found no candidates in the overwrap region with the
LIGO-Virgo high probability localization region.  The 90% 
upper limit of CAL is 5.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) 
when the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 95%. The CAL 
FOV was centered at RA = 167.5 deg, DEC = -24.8 deg at T0.
