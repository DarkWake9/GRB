report on behalf of the GLAST Burst Monitor Team:


"At 03:52:10 UT on 2008 Aug 17, the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 080817 (GBM 080817.161 / trigger 240637931).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 151.29, Dec = -19.26 (J2000 degrees)
(equivalent to J2000 10h 05m, -19d 15' ),
with an uncertainty of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error
which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Large Area Telescope (LAT)
boresight is 80 degrees.

This GRB has a duration of approximately ~70 s and 
contains 2 main peaks in the interval between 0 and 25 s 
and a weaker peak around 50 s.

Spectral analysis is in progress."
