D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) reports:

In the third paragraph of the previous circular (GCN 9601), the 
reference to the extended emission possibly associated with G1 being 
spread over several "arcminutes" should instead read that the emission 
is spread over several arcseconds.

A g-band thumbnail image showing this emission (and the nearby "knot") 
more clearly is posted to:
