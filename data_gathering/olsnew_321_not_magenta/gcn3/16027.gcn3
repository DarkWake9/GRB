SUBJECT: GRB 140323A: Swift detection of a burst
DATE:    14/03/23 10:40:32 GMT
FROM:    Eleonora Troja at GSFC  <eleonora.troja@nasa.gov>

E. Troja (NASA/GSFC/UMCP), V. D'Elia (ASDC),
H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), C. J. Mountford (U Leicester),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. N. Ukwatta (MSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 10:23:11 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140323A (trigger=592916).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 356.888, -79.917 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 23h 47m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = -79d 55' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 120 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~89 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 10:24:49.4 UT, 97.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 356.9593,
-79.9050 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 47m 50.23s
   Dec(J2000) = -79d 54' 17.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 62 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 7.93
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 0.1 s image was 1.95e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 105 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.14. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Troja (eleonora.troja AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
