Using the data set from T-204 to T+843 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220430A (trigger #1104692)
(Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 31972).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 97.616, 9.547 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 30m 27.9s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 32' 50.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows two major pulse emissions. The first
one starts at ~T-7 s, peaks at ~T+20 s, and ends at ~T+30 s. It is
followed by another larger pulse with several peaks. The largest peak
occurs at ~T+42 s. The burst emission ends at ~T+100 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 43.10 +- 0.57 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.53 to T+94.36 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.24 +- 0.02.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
4.4 +- 0.05 x 10^-5 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+42.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 29.6 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
