D. Gotz (CEA-Saclay) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team reports:

Further analysis of the INTEGRAL GRB 071109 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 7046)
using IBIS/ISGRI data yielded the following results.

The peak flux of the burst integrated over 1 s in the 20-200 keV energy
range is 0.46 photons (3.6E-8 ergs)/cmsq/s. The fluence in the same band,
integrated over 30 s, is 6.6E-7 ergs/cmsq.
