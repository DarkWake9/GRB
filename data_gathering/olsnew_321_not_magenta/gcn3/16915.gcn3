J. Japelj (U. Ljubljana) and C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

We observed the position of GRB 141015A (Troja et al. GCN Circ. 16909) with the 1-m McDonald telescope (Fort Davis, US), a member of the Las Cumbres Observatory network. Observations started on October 15 at 09:51:01 UT, i.e., 38 minutes after the GRB trigger time (GCN Circ. 16909) and were done with the g', r' and i' filters.

We did not find a new source within the enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN Circ. 16913) down to the following limits:

Mid time from  Total Exp   Filter    Magnitude
trigger (min)          (s)
-----------------------------------------------------------
54.4                       600        r'        > 19.6
59.2                       600        i'        > 18.7
-----------------------------------------------------------

Magnitudes are calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 stars.
