The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:06:59 UT on 9 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200609A (trigger 613386424.308736 / 200609380).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 16.3, Dec = 67.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 05m, 67d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 150.0 degrees.
