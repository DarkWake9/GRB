We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB GRB100511A (Swift trigger 421695)
with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope
at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 14:19:42 UT, about two and
a half hours after the Swift trigger time.
We have compared our data of 30 sec exposures
with the USNO-A2.0 catalog,
There is no new source at the reported position.

the upper limits are as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Start(UT) End(UT) Num. of frames Limit (mag.)
--------------------------------------------------------------
14:19:42 14:20:12 1 14.9
14:19:42 15:02:15 26 16.0
