on behalf of the INTEGRAL GRB team,  report:

A short duration hard spectrum GRB, 060427B, occurred at about 23:51:55
UT.  It was observed by Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey (GRS and HEND),
INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, and Swift-BAT.  The burst was outside of the field of
view of Swift-BAT, so it was not imaged.  As the burst arrived almost
along the Odyssey-Earth vector, the resulting annulus was unusually
wide.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~0.2 sec.
A weak emission is seen in the K-W G2 band (83-360 keV) starting
at ~0.3 sec before the main pulse.

The burst has been triangulated to RA, Dec = 98.472, +21.348 deg (J2000).
The corners of the 3 sigma error box are:
-----------------------
RA, deg   Dec, deg
-----------------------
98.8479  22.7146
98.7014  19.9202
98.0629  19.9948
98.1954  22.8568
--------------------

The area of this error box is 1.7 sq. deg.

Konus-Wind spectral analysis is in progress.  Preliminary analysis
indicates that Epeak was >1 MeV.
