Various IPN spacecraft have observed the possible activity of
SGR1806-20 (Golenetski et al. GCN Circ. 4310, 4312).  The following
table summarizes the results. 


DATE    TIME    REFERENCE  ANNULUS CENTER   ANNULUS RADIUS    DISTANCE FROM  SPACECRAFT  SGR1801?

051203  32626   4310     216.686 -15.337    52.647+/-0.275     0.161            K,O         No
051203  42204   4312     273.814 -20.444     7.139+/-7.139     5.692            K,R,S,I     Yes



NOTES: The annulus center RA and Dec are J2000.  The uncertainty in the
radius is 3 sigma.  The distance from SGR1806-20 is the distance
between the center line of the annulus and the source, in degrees.  The
spacecraft are Konus (K), Odyssey (O), RHESSI (R), Swift (S), and
INTEGRAL (I); Ulysses was off.  SGR1801? indicates whether the IPN
annulus is consistent with the position of SGR1801-23 (Cline et al.,
Ap.J. 531, 407, 2000).  For the first event on 051203, SGR1806 and
SGR1801 were Earth-occulted for RHESSI.  The triangulation annulus
(actually a circle) for the second event on 051203 is also consistent
with the position of the bursting pulsar, GROJ1744-28.

These localizations support the conclusion that the source of the
first two events, and therefore probably the third also, is indeed 
SGR1806-20.
