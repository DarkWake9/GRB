SUBJECT: GRB 070311: PAIRITEL confirmation of variability of REM candidate

J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) reports:

We analyzed the stack of images of the field of GRB 070311  
(Mereghetti et al. GCN 6189) obtained with the 1.3m PAIRITEL project  
starting 2007-03-11 02:07:17 UTC (494 second total). The source noted  
as a possible afterglow by Covino et al. (GCN 6190) is well detected  
in J and H band. A comparison to 2MASS yields a preliminary H-band  
magnitude of H=17.0 +/- 0.1.  This is 2.7 magnitudes fainter and ~14  
minutes later than the REM detection. As such, we confirm that the  
source noted by Covino et al. is indeed the afterglow of GRB 070311.
