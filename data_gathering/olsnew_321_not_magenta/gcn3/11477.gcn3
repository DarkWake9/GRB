A.J. van der Horst (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 16:28:13.12 UT on 19 December 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered and located GRB 101219B (trigger 314468895 /
101219686), which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (GCN 11473).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one peak with a duration (T90)
of 51 +/- 2 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-4.1 s to T0+47.1 s is best fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 70 +/- 8 keV, alpha = 0.33 +/- 0.36, and beta = -2.12 +/- 0.12.
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.5 +/- 0.4)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+5.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band is
2.0 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The temporal and spectral analysis results presented above are
preliminary; final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
