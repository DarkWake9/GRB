On 25 Dec. 18:18 UT, the Chandra Observatory targeted the field of
GRB031220, which was localized by the HETE satellite (HETE trigger 2976).
The 40 ksec observation spanned the interval 5.6 - 6.1 days after the
burst. More than 99% of the HETE/SXC error region was contained within the
field-of-view of the Chandra ACIS-I chip.

>From a preliminary analysis of the data we detected seven sources in this
region in the 0.2-10 keV band:

Source #37 is near the border of the chip.

None of these source is present in the SIMBAD and 2-MASS catalogues.

At this stage of the analysis, the astrometry  is dominated by the
systematic error in the attitude reconstruction.
The nominal attitude reconstruction has been checked by using 3 stars with
detectable X-ray emission, giving an average systematic error of about 1",
that has to be added in quadrature to the statistical error reported
above.

A second observation with Chandra should be carried out around mid
January.

We thank the personnel at the Chandra Science Center for the assistance in
the acquisition and preliminary processing of these data.
