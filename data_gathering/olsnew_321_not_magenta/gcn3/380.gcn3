TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  380
SUBJECT: Updated IPN localization of GRB990705

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of the
NEAR GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

NEAR observed GRB990705.  Triangulation with NEAR, BeppoSAX, and Ulysses
results in a ~3.5 arcmin.^2 error box which intersects the BeppoSAX NFI
error circle.  The preliminary 3 sigma error box coordinates are:

RA(2000)	Decl.(2000)
5h 09m 37.0s	-72o 05' 56"
5h 09m 46.8s	-72o 08' 26"
5h 09m 57.9s	-72o 05' 56"
5h 10m 07.6s	-72o 08' 25" 

As for the previous IPN localization (GCN 378), this error box includes
the ESO NTT source reported in GCN 377.  An updated map showing the
three annuli which form the error box may found at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990705/.
