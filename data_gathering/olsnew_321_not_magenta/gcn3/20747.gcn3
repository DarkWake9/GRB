report on behalf of the iPTF and GROWTH collaborations

Under cloudy and windy weather conditions, the following classification
spectra were obtained with the Palomar 200-in telescope using the DBSP
spectrograph (Oke & Gunn, 1982, PASP, 94, 586).

ATLAS17aic (=iPTF17jg) was observed on 2017-02-23 13:03 UT. The spectrum
shows strong galaxy emission lines at z=0.013 and a broad P-cygni Halpha
profile, consistent with a Type II SN a few weeks after maximum light.

PS17bew (=iPTF17bbq) was observed on 2017-02-23 10:33 UT . The spectrum
shows broad Halpha emission, consistent with a Type II SN, confirming the
classification reported by PESSTO (ATel #10127).

iPTF17bdd was observed on 2017-02-23 11:48 UT. The spectrum is dominated by
galaxy light, as was also the case in the spectrum reported from Liverpool
Telescope (LVC GCN #20734).
