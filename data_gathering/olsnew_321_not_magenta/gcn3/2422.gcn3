D. Gotz (IASF, Milano) on behalf of the IBAS localization team reports:

IBAS alert 1180 does not correspond to a GRB but to a burst from
SGR 1806-20, not black listed due to incorrect attitude. Offline analysis
shows that this burst is related to the Soft Gamma Repeater.

Details on this and other not yet reported bursts will follow.
