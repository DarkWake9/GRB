F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC),
V. D'Elia (ASDC), C. Gronwall (PSU), P. T. O'Brien (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:47:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130719A (trigger=562625).  Swift could not slew to the burst
due to a Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 89.039, -11.585 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 56m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 35' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve is dominated by
variation from Vela X-1, which is also in the FOV, so nothing
can be stated about the burst light curve for this image
trigger at this time. 

Due to the Sun constraint, XRT and UVOT will not be able to
observe the burst location until July 26. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
