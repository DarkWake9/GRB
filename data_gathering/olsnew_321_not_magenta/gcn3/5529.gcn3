SUBJECT: GRB 060906 (?): P60 Optical Afterglow Candidate

S. B. Cenko, E. O. Ofek (Caltech) and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of Swift trigger 228316 (GRB 060906?) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations were taken in the
Kron R filter beginning approximately 12 minutes after the burst.  Inside
the BAT error circle, we find a stationary object not present in the
Digitized Sky Survey at the location (J2000.0):

	RA: 02:43:00.9
	Dec: +30:21:42.12

We estimate the magnitude of the object to be R ~ 19.0, based on
comparison with several USNO-B objects in the field.  Given the brightness
and stationary nature of the object, we consider it a possible optical
afterglow.  Further observations are underway to search for variability.
