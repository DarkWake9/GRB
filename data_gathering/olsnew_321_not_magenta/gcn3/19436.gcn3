SUBJECT: GRB 160519A: Swift detection of a burst

P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and J. A. Kennea (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:17:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160519A (trigger=686818).  Swift did not slew due to Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 71.113, +31.197, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 44m 27s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 11' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single, possibly multiple,
peaks with a duration of about 6 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 11:24 UT on 2016 July 22. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. D'Avanzo (paolo.davanzo AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
