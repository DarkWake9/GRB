We obtained 6*1200 s spectra of the proposed host galaxy of
GRB 060912A (Levan et al. GCN 5573), using FORS2 on the VLT.
The combined spectrum shows a very strong emission line at 7218A
which we identify with [OII] 3727A at a redshift of z = 0.937. At
the same redshift we also identify H-gamma in emission and possibly
NeIII 3869A. The properties of this host galaxy (in particular
strong [OII] emission) are similar to those seen in long-duration
GRB hosts. We conclude that the proximity of this burst to a low
redshift elliptical galaxy was most likely coincidental.

We thank the VLT staff for their assistance in these observations.
