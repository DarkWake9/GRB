SUBJECT: GRB 140710A: Gemini-N redshift of likely host

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) and
D. Coulson (Gemini) report:

We observed the position of GRB 140710A (Siegel et al.
GCN 16563; Tanga et al. GCN 16565/6; Cenko et al. GCN 16567;
Butler et al. GCN 16568) with the GMOS-N spectrograph on
Gemini-North.  Observations began at 14:06 UT, approximately
3.8 hr post burst.

The spectrum shows a faint continuum and emission lines of
OII (3727), Hbeta (4863) and OIII (4959/5007) at a common 
redshift of z=0.558.  There is also some evidence for a 4000A
break at the same redshift.  Given the fading nature already reported, 
and the slight extension of the source in the acquisition images,
it is very likely that this is the redshift of the GRB host galaxy, and 
that it is already comparable to the afterglow brightness.
