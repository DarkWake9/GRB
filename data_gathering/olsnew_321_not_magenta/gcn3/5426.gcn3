The soft gamma-ray event 060806 related to SGR1806-20
(Hurley et al., GCN 5416, 5419) is of great interest,
However it hardly can be defined as unique for SGR1806-20,
all of the main features of this event were also observed earlier.
In 2006 SGR1806-20 renewed its activity in the middle of July.
Until now it has emitted about 20 soft bursts.

The GRB060806 composes a cluster of 6 separate bursts
similar to clusters observed in 2004 on October 5, December 24 and 25.
Energy spectra of all bursts in the table are identical,
revealing the same value of kT = 20 +/- 0.5 keV.
What is more, the last burst in the cluster, wich lasts for
~30 s and exhibits three broad pulses separated by
time intervals of ~7.55 s, strikingly resembles the light curve
of the soft burst from SGR 1806-20 occured on December 3, 2005.
This burst also starts a quick growing spike followed by
a long tail with two broad if less pronounced peaks of periodic pulsations.
