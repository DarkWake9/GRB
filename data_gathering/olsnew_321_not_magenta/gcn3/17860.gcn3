We report further analysis using the MAXI/GSC data of MAXI GRB 150518A 
(Kawamuro et al. GCN Circ. 17825).  The MAXI GSC light curve shows a constant 
flux during the scan.  Due to a poor statistics, it is hard to claim a 
variability in the light curve.  The MAXI light curve plot is available from 
the following URL.

The GSC spectrum (2-20 keV) using the data from 21:42:00 UT to 21:42:49 UT 
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The best fit power-law photon index 
is 1.3 +- 0.4.  The column density is not well constrained from the GSC spectrum.  
The unabsorbed flux in the 2-20 keV band is (1.0 +- 0.3) x 10^-8 erg/cm2/s.  
From this best fit model, the unabsorbed X-ray flux in the 0.3-10 keV band 
(Swift/XRT energy band) is (7.9 +- 2.4) x 10^-9 erg/cm2/s.  No emission was 
detected from the GRB position during the next scan starting from 23:11 UT at 
the 1 sigma upper limit of ~9 mCrab.

Using the possible host galaxy redshift of 0.256 (Xu et al. GCN Circ. 17832), 
the X-ray luminosity at the time of the MAXI detection is 1.7 x 10^48 erg/s (2-20 keV) 
and 1.3 x 10^48 erg/s (0.3-10 keV).  Assuming the onset of this GRB is the 
detection by Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al. GCN Circ. 17837), we found that 
the MAXI luminosity around ~1000 sec after this onset is consistent with a typical 
early afterglow emission seen by Swift/XRT (e.g., Racusin et al. 2011, ApJ, 738, 138).

On the other hand, if the possible emission seen by the Konus-Wind data around 
the MAXI detection is real, the duration of GRB 150518A can be >1000 s.  As we 
reported above, the MAXI GSC spectrum is rather hard for an afterglow.  In this 
case, this GRB can be classified as an ultra-long GRB.  

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.  The assumed cosmological 
parameters are H0 = 71 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, Omega_m = 0.27 and Omega_lamda = 0.73.
