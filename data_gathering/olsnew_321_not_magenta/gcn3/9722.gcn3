Guidorzi (INAF-OAB) report:

"Further analysis of the optical light curves of the uncatalogued optical 
source, at RA(J2000)=21:03:50.6, Dec(J2000)= +64:55:30, reported by Smith 
& Mundell (GCN Circ. 9719) show significant variability and confirm this 
object as the optical afterglow of GRB 090727 (SWIFT trigger 358520, 
Evans et al, GCN Circ. 9718; Goad et al. GCN Circ. 9721).

Within the first 100 mins, the optical light curve shows an early-time 
flare, peaking at r'=19.4 mag, followed by a plateau and break - features 
that are the same as suggested by the partially sampled XRT light curve.

Observations are ongoing."
