The long GRB 080413A (Swift/BAT trigger #309096 ; Beardmore et al., GCN
 7594) was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 02:54:18.648 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a clear double-peaked structure
 at T0+2s and T0+16s, and possible weak peak at T0+45s,
 with a total duration (T90) of about 19 seconds.
The fluence in 150 - 1000 keV was (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+2s was 0.77 +/- 0.19 photons/cm^2/s
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0+0s to T0+20s
is fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of
2.4 +/- 0.4 (chi^2/d.o.f = 15.1/10) in 150 - 1000 keV.
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
