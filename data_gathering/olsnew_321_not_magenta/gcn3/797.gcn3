K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on
behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets
and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed this burst at 73856 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~20 s, a
25-100 keV fluence of ~1.5E-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux
over 0.25 s of 1.6E-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it
to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose coordinates are

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 14 h 20 m 27.29 s     19 o 48 '  43.25 "  (CENTER)
 14 h 20 m 27.78 s     19 o 51 '  44.34 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 19 m 48.08 s     19 o 58 '  30.36 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 21 m  6.43 s     19 o 38 '  55.01 "  (CORNER)
 14 h 20 m 26.79 s     19 o 45 '  42.16 "  (CORNER)

The approximate area of this box is 60 square arcminutes.
It can be improved by further processing.
