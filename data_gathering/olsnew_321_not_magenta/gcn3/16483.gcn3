G. Masi, the Virtual Telescope Project - Italy, reports:

I started observations of GRB 140629A (Lien et al. GCN  16477) with the 14" 
robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope at 20:12:00 (UT), 21300 seconds after 
the burst.

The optical afterglow reported earlier (Lien et al. GCN 16477;  Yurkov et al., 
GCN 16478; Xin et al., GCN 16480) was detected in 300 seconds exposures, 
unfiltered. The position of the source is RA: 16h35m54.43s; Decl.: +41d52'36.3" 
and the magnitude was estimated to be 18.8, assuming R mags for the reference 
stars from UCAC-4
