V. Toy (UMD), A. Cucchiara (NASA-GSFC), J. Capone (UMD),
D. Kocevski (NASA-GSFC), S.B. Cenko (NASA-GSFC),
E. Troja (NASA-GSFC),  A. Kutyrev (NASA-GSFC), S. Veilleux (UMD),
and S. Gezari (UMD) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We report that in GCN 16367 we mistakenly estimated the time post-burst
for our DCT observations.

The optical transient was observed  from 2014/06/08 9:05 to 2014/06/08
09:41 UTC, which corresponds to 53.9 hours after the GRB discovery
(GCN 16363) and not 29.9 hours as reported.

We apologize for any confusion this might have caused and we thank
Dan Perley for pointing out this inconsistency.
