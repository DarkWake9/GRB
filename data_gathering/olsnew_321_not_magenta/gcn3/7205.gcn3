Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080123 (trigger #301578)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 7203).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 338.974, -64.930 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 35m 53.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 55' 48" 
with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 20%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two well-separated peaks.  The first
starts at ~T+0.3 sec and is no wider than 64 msec.  The second peak
starts at ~T+0.6 sec with a FRED-like shape and a duration of ~256 msec.
There is soft extended emission lasting ~120 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
115 +- 30 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.3 to T+122.2 sec (SHB plus extended
emmission) is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.15 +- 0.54.  The fluence in the
15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 1.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T-0.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
