Using the data set from T-173 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220714B (trigger #1116221)
(Laha, et al., GCN Circ. 32393).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 47.086, -19.321 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 08m 20.7s
   Dec(J2000) = -19d 19' 13.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 88%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a complex structure.  The main period of
emission starts around T-5 sec and continues to T+35 seconds with three main
overlapping pulses.  There is some precursor activity starting as early as T-45
seconds and low-level emission extending to T+60 seconds.  The spacecraft
slewed away from the burst location at around T+275 seconds.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 50.10 +- 7.96 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from -48.27 to +45.75 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.92 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+12.89 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
