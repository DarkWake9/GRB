A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM 
Team:

"At 17:16:42.93 UT on 18 July 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090718 (trigger 269630204 / 090718720).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 242.5, DEC = -6.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 16h10m, -6d35'),
with an uncertainty of 7.4 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error
which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51 degrees.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
