D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OABr), M. Cecconi (INAF/FGG), 
C. P. Padilla-Torres (INAF/FGG), report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130502A (Troja et al., GCN 14527) with the 
TNG equipped with DOLoRes. A 10-minute image in the SDSS r filer was 
taken starting on May 2.872 UT (3.08 hr after the GRB trigger).

Close to the edge of the current XRT error circle (see 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/), we detect a faint object, with 
coordinates (J2000):

RA = 09:14:16.42
Dec = -00:07:23.0

The object has r = 23.49 +- 0.16 AB, calibrated against nearby SDSS DR8 
stars.

At the present time, we cannot assess the variability of the target, nor 
its relation with GRB 130502A. Further observations are planned.
