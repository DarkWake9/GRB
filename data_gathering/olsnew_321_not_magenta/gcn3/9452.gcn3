D. Malesani, D. Xu, G. Leloudas, J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), P. Jakobsson 
(Univ. Iceland), M.E. Brown (Caltech), E.L. Schaller (Univ. Hawaii), and 
T. Liimets (NOT & Tartu Obs.) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 090530 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9438) with the 
NOT equipped with the MOSCA camera. Observations were carried out in the 
R band, starting on 2009 May 30.879 UT (17.8 hr after the GRB).

The optical afterglow (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9438; Flewelling et al., GCN 
9439; Morgan et al., GCN 9440) is clearly detected in a single 300s 
exposure, with a magnitude R = 21.6 assuming R = 18.17 for the USNO star 
at RA = 11:57:41.68, Dec = +26:35:43.3.
