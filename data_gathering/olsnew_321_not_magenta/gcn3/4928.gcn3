TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4928
SUBJECT: GRB 060322: Confirmation of Swift XRT afterglow

M. Perri, L. Vetere (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift XRT team:

The Swift XRT observed the field of GRB 060322 (GCN 4903, Perri et al.)
for a second time on 2005-03-25 from 00:37:09 UT until 21:53:57 UT.
We confirm that the X-ray source identified by Perri et al. (GCN 4919,
RA(J2000) = 18h 16m 56.4s, Dec(J2000) = -36d 42' 31" )
has faded from view and is therefore the likely X-ray afterglow of
this burst.

Using an exposure of ~11 ks in Photon Counting mode we place a three
sigma upper limit on the 0.3-10 keV count rate of 2.0e-3 cts/s which
is significantly lower than the count rate observed with the first
exposure (3.0+/-0.7)e-3 cts/s, implying that the source has faded.

We conclude that the candidate reported in GCN 4919 is the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 060322.
