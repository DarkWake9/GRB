the Swift-BAT team,

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, RHESSI, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Suzaku (WAM), and
Swift (BAT)  observed this hard-spectrum GRB starting around 04621
seconds.  It had a duration of about 215 s in two distinct episodes,
and a fluence of about 3 x 10^-4 erg/cm^2.  We have triangulated it to
a preliminary ~855 sq. arcmin. error box (3 sigma), whose coordinates are:

Center:  127.639, -42.210 
Corners: 127.490, -42.705
	 127.737, -43.008
         127.555, -41.399 
         127.774, -41.726

This error box may be improved.  It was outside the Swift BAT field of
view for both episodes, and therefore Swift did not image the burst,
although it did detect it.  However, in the course of a later,
preplanned observation beginning at T+10 minutes, BAT imaged a weak source
within the IPN error box, at RA, Dec= 127.630, -42.696, which could be
the gamma-ray afterglow.  A ToO observation of this source has been
requested.  Further details of the energy spectrum will be given in a
forthcoming GCN.
