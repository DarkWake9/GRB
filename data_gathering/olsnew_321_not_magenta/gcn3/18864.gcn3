on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

A short-duration GRB 160111A has been detected by Konus-Wind, Swift 
(BAT), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 26526 s UT (07:22:06). 
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    43.835 (02h 55m 20s) +34.176 (+34d 10' 34")
  Corners:
    45.937 (03h 03m 45s) +28.261 (+28d 15' 40")
    40.903 (02h 43m 37s) +39.971 (+39d 58' 17")
    41.650 (02h 46m 36s) +40.070 (+40d 04' 11")
    46.604 (03h 06m 25s) +28.319 (+28d 19' 08")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 7.1 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 12.6 deg (the minimum one is 34.3 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 118 deg.

This box may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming 
GCN Circular.
