F.Y. Huang, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

"The R and V band images of GRB 051109B (Tagliaferri et al. GCN 4222)
were taken by Lulin 1-m telescope. The observation are started at 1.51
hours after the burst.  No new source was detected at Swift/UVOT
position (Tagliaferri et al. GCN 4222) and Swift/XRT (Campana et
al. 4226) error regions. Compare with USNOB1.0 stars, the limiting
magnitudes of our R and V band co-add images (300s x 3 for each band)
are estimated as 21.0 and 20.0, respectively.
