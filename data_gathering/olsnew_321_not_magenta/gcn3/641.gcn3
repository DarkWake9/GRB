K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB Team, M. Feroci, F. Frontera,
and C. Guidorzi, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, T. Cline and
E. Mazets, on behalf of the NEAR and KONUS-Wind teams, report:

Ulysses, SAX, KONUS, and NEAR detected GRB000419 at 07970 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, this burst had a duration of 40 s and
a 25-100 keV fluence of 4.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.  We have triangulated
it to a 220 sq. arcmin. error box whose preliminary 3 sigma
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 19 h 43 m  7.13 s     51 o 35 '  18.53 "  (CENTER)
 19 h 41 m 40.18 s     51 o 36 '  51.54 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 40 m 52.76 s     51 o 29 '  34.62 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 45 m 25.59 s     51 o 40 '  55.14 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 44 m 34.68 s     51 o 33 '  41.76 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined.
