"Using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope we have obtained spectra of the 
afterglow of GRB 050401 (GCN 3161, 3162, 3163) on 2005, April 2. We detect 
several absorption lines consistent with two absorption systems at redshifts 
z = 2.50 and z = 2.90. The likely redshift of GRB 050401 is hence z = 2.90.
For a standard cosmology (H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_w = 0.7, 
w = -1) the Swift fluence (GCN 3173) corresponds to an isotropic energy 
release of 2.6 x 10^53 erg.

We thank Paul Price for providing a finding chart for the optical afterglow 
and the ESO staff for excellent support."
