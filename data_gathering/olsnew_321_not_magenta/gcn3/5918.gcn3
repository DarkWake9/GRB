At 12:16:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061214 (trigger=250908).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 7.777, -29.640 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 31m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 38' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  Given that this is a 4-msec trigger in the high
energy band makes this likely that this trigger is a cosmic ray shower. 
The BAT light curve shows nothing significant, which is also consistant
with a cosmic ray shower.  The peak count rate was ~1000 counts/sec
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.  Prior to receiving the full
data set in the next downlink, it seems equally likely at this point
that this is cosmic ray shower or a GRB. 

The XRT began taking data at 12:18:15 UT, 82 seconds after the BAT
trigger. The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in
the image and no prompt position is available. Analysis of promptly
downlinked photon counting data reveals no source in a 163 s exposure. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 87 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle. The  3-sigma
upper limit is 19.9 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle. The list of
sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been
made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.
