U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120819A detected 
by SWIFT(trigger 531428) with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy.

The observations started 6h 35min. after the 
GRB trigger(delay due to expecting the night)
with our Schmidt telescope D=400mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added 2 series of 15 unfiltered CCD exposures of 120s each.

We did not appear any reasonable optical counterpart 
in the error box of the XRTcandidate (Beardmore et al., GCNC 13681) 
at our limiting magnitude.

Start      End       M.lim.
395min     454min    19.5

Magnitudes were estimated with the USNO-B1 cat.
