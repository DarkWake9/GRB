S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester),
on behalf of the Swift Team report:
 
Using the BAT data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report on further analysis of BAT trigger #557466
that the trigger is not due to anything astrophysical.  It was a chance
coincidence of noise in the image domain and a known source.

Analysis of 1 ks of XRT reveals no source in or near the BAT error circle.
