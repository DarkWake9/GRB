We imaged the field of GRB041224 (Barthelmy et al., GCN 2908) with the 
60cm REM robotic telescope located in La Silla (Chile). Observations 
were carried out in the J, H and K filters, while the bright and close 
Moon (<40 deg away) prevented observations in the optical.
Only the central 10'x10' region of BAT error circle was imaged 
(approximately 60%), under good seeing conditions (1"), starting on 2004 
Dec 25, at 1:06 UT, and ending at 1:39 UT (approximately 5 hours after 
the burst).

Visual inspection of the NIR frames didn't reveal any new object when 
compared with the 2MASS catalog. Our frames are deeper than this survey, 
therefore further observations are in progress to search for variable 
sources.
