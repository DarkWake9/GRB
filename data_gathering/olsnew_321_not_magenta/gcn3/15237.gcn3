A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), B. Hafizov (UBAI), O. Burhonov
(UBAI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We continue observation of the afterglow  (Hagen et al., GCN  15139; 
Guidorzi et al., GCN 15140) of the Swift GRB 130831A (Hagen et al., GCN 
  15139)  with AZT-22 telescope equipped with SNUCAM at Maidanak 
observatory. A preliminary photometry of combined images obtained on 
Sep. 16 is following:

T_start              T0+       Filter, Exposure, OT
(UT)                 (mid, d)            (s)

2013-09-16T19:00:13  16.28     R       14x300     22.77 +/- 0.07

The photometry is based on  SDSS stars (see GCN 15190).

This is brighter than we obtained on Sep. 9  (23.11 +/- 0.06) and  on 
Sep. 15 (22.87 +/- 0.08). We suggest the observed re-brightening is an 
emerging Supernova associated with GRB 130831A.

A preliminary lc of the afterglow+SN of GRB 130831A can be found in
