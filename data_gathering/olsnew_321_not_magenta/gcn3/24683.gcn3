The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) of AGILE detected a gamma-ray transient
temporally coincident with the long  GRB 190530A reported by Lucarelli et al.,
GCN #24678 and also detected and localized by Fermi/GBM (GCN #24676) and
Fermi/LAT (GCN #24679).

A preliminary GRID analysis in the energy range 30 MeV - 1 GeV shows a
detection with a statistical significance of about 4 sigma, at the sky position
R.A., Decl. (J2000): 120,+34 ± 5 deg (Galactic coordinates l,b: 187,+28 deg),
over a time integration of 500 s starting from the T0 of GRB 190530A.

This preliminary estimated position was above 30 deg from the GRID boresight.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
