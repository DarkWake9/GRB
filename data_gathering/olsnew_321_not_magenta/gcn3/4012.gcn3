E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), S.A. Yost (U Mich), W. Rujopakarn (U Mich), R. 
Quimby (U Texas), D. A. Smith (Guilford), F. Yuan (U Mich) report
on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe,
Turkey, responded to GRB 050922C (Swift trigger 156467).  (Note that the 
burst designation in GCN 4011 is incorrect).

We obtained 10 5-s images followed by 12 20-s images before 
precipitation ended observations.  The object reported in GCN 4011 fades 
significantly from 172 s post-burst to 651 s post-burst as a simple 
power-law with index -1.0.  At 640 s post-burst the counterpart was at 
16.0+/-0.1 mag (unfiltered) relative to the USNO A2.0 R-band magnitudes.
