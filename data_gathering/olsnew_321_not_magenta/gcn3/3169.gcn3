Derek B. Fox and S. Bradley Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We note that the IR afterglow candidate of Chen et al. (GCN 3168) has
a point-like counterpart in second-generation Digitized Sky Survey
(XDSS) i-band (n-emulsion) images.  The source is also detected close
to threshold in R-, I-, and z-band imaging from P60.  Analysis as to
source variability is ongoing."
