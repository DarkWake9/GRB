SUBJECT: BATSE observations of FXT/GRB 000416 = 1SAXJ1715.0-7134

R. M. Kippen (University of Alabama in Huntsville) and P. M. Woods
(Universities Space Research Association) report on behalf of the
CGRO-BATSE team:

The fast x-ray transient (possible gamma-ray burst) 1SAXJ1715.0-7134
observed with BeppoSAX-WFC on April 16.60618 UT (Piro et al., GCN 635)
was detected with BATSE, having significant flux in the 20-100 keV
energy range.  The event did not activate the BATSE on-board trigger
system (currently operating in the >100 keV energy range), but was
recorded in continuous data mode with 1.024-s temporal resolution.
Furthermore, the BATSE location is consistent with that of the WFC.
The event consisted of a single weak pulse lasting about 8 seconds.
The peak flux was 0.14 (-/+ 0.04) ph/cm2/s (50-300 keV; 1.024 s), with
a total fluence of 2.9 (-/+ 0.3) E-7 erg/cm2 (>20 keV).  The spectrum
is consistent with a single power-law model with photon index -2.7
(-/+ 0.2).  About 1% of BATSE gamma-ray bursts have such soft spectra.
If this event is a gamma-ray burst, it ranks in the lower ~2% (10%) of
the BATSE flux/fluence distribution.
