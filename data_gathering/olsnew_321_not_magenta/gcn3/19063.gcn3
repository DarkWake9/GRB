(INAF-IASFPA) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the INTEGRAL-detected
burst GRB 160223B (Gotz et al. GCN Circ. 19059), collecting 2.3 ks of
Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+10.6 ks and T0+16.4 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the INTEGRAL
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field ranges from ~0.004
to ~0.005 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
1.8e-13 to 1.9e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020601.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
