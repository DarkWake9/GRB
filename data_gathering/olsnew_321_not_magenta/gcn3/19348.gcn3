and H.A. Krimm report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 160425A (Krimm et al. GCN
Circ. 19343), from 207 s to 18.4 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 439 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 19347).

The late-time light curve (from T0+6.1 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=0.78 (+/-0.23).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.18 (+/-0.04). The
best-fitting absorption column is  5.26 (+0.23, -0.22) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 7.7 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.76 (+0.19, -0.18)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 5.7 (+/-0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 2.9 x 10^-11 (9.0 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     5.7 (+/-0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 7.7 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 10.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.76 (+0.19, -0.18)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.78, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.019 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.5 x
10^-13 (1.7 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
