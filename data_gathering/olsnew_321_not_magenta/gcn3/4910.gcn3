on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:

We have analysed the first five orbits of Swift XRT data on the BAT GRB
060323 (Vetere, et al., GCN 4904). The XRT began observing in Windowed
Timing mode at 14:35:20 UT on 2006-03-23, 164 s after the BAT trigger.

In the 0.3-10 keV energy band the afterglow shows a flat light curve from
T+164s up to about T+800s, then it fades with a decay index of 1.2+/-0.1
up to T+20ks.

The X-ray spectrum covering the time period from T+164s to T+614s is
well fit by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.9+/-0.3 and a
column density consistent with the Galactic value in the direction of the
source (1.54e20 cm**-2). The unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux for this
spectrum is 7.5e-12 erg/cm**2/s.

Assuming the X-ray emission continues to decline at the same rate, we
predict a 0.3-10 keV XRT count rate of 0.002 count/s at T+24hr, which
corresponds to an unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.1e-13 erg/cm**2/s.
