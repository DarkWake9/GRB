report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190901ap at T0 = 2019-09-01 
23:31:01.838
UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that the 
Gamma-Ray
Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered about 20% of the 90% c.l. 
localization
region (LR) (13% of 90% c.l. localization region (LR) is occulted by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S190901ap 90% c.l. LR was 
available.
No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are 
obtained:

from 3.00e-07 to 9.32e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 16% of 
the LR over
the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 10s );
from 3.59e-08 to 6.91e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 26% of 
the LR over
the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
