S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck (ISDC, 
Versoix), J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun), A. von Kienlin, A. Rau, G. Lichti 
(MPE, Garching) on behalf of the IBAS Team report:

The bright event seen by Konus/Wind about 2800 s after GRB 050525 and 
reported in GCN 3474 (Golenetskii et al. 2005) has also been detected by 
the Anti-Coincidence Shield of the SPI instrument on board INTEGRAL, 
starting at 00:49:50 UT and lasting about 16 seconds.

At that time the position of GRB 050525A (GCN Circ. 3466, 3467, 3472) was 
inside the field of view of the IBIS imaging instrument. No signal was 
detected from this direction, indicating that the event at 00:49:50 UT is 
not related with GRB 050525A and is most likely another bright GRB.
