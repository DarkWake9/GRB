E. Berger (Carnegie) reports:

"The object proposed as the host galaxy of GRB 061217 in GCN 5948 (located 
11 arcsec from the revised XRT position), appears to have a stellar point 
spread function in both our IMACS (GCN #529) and LDSS3 (GCN #5949) images. 
We re-iterate the presence of an extended object within the XRT error 
circle (GCN #5949)."
