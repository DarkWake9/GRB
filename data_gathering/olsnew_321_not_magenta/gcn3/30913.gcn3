C. Fletcher (USRA) and C. Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:00:31.01 UT on 28 September 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210928A (trigger 654487236 / 210928084)
which was also detected by the Fermi LAT (M. Axelsson et al. 2021, GCN 30912).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 16 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 24 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+2.1 s to T0+26.6 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.45 +/- 0.02 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 465 +/- 10 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.925 +/- 0.052)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+18.04 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.6 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
