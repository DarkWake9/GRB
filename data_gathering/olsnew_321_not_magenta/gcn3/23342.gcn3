P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), H. A. Krimm (NSF/USRA), D. M. Palmer (LANL),
T. Sakamoto (AGU), B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report
on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 00:55:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 181016A (trigger=867252).  Due to an observing constraint,
Swift could not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 231.268, -35.279 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 25m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 16' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 09:03 UT on 2019 January 03. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. D'Avanzo (paolo.davanzo AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
