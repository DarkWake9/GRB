M.C. Stroh (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

We have analyzed the first four orbits of Swift-XRT data obtained for  
GRB 080701 (Stroh et al., GCN Circ. 7910), totaling 2.4ks of Photon  
Counting data.

The UVOT-enhanced XRT position has been given by Evans et al. in GCN  
Circ 7914.

The X-ray light-curve can be fit by a power-law with a decay index of  
1.04 +/- 0.27. Assuming a constant decay rate, we predict counting  
rates at T+24 and T+48 hours of 4.55e-3 and 2.21e-3 cts/s respectively.

The spectrum can be fit with a power-law in excess of the Galactic  
value (1.78e21 cm-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of  
9.21 (+6.43/-4.78)e21 cm^-2 and a photon index of 2.93 (+0.79/-0.59).  
The observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux is 3.55e-12 (1.976e-11) ergs/ 
cm^2/s.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
