D. M. Smith, and K. Hurley on behalf of the RHESSI team report:

As observed by RHESSI, GRB070508 (Grupe et al., GCN 6383)
had a duration of ~18 s starting at about T0=04:18:20 UT.
RHESSI detected significant emission up to ~300 keV.
The preliminary fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum
from T0 - T0+16 s between 30 keV and 10 MeV is a cutoff power law with

alpha = -0.76 +0.52/-0.41
Epeak = 254 +71/-45 keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 30 keV-10 MeV fluence is 1.95 +0.28/-0.23 E-5 erg/cm^2.
