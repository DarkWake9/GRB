report:

We have observed the error box of GRB001019 as part
of the monitoring effort by the AAVSO GRB network.
  R-band images of the entire error box taken 001021
at 0100 UT with a limiting magnitude of R=18.0, based on
USNO-A2.0 reference stars, do not show any new object
in comparison with the DSS scans of the POSS-II red plate.
  Unfiltered images with a similar limiting magnitude and
covering about 95 percent of the error box, taken 001021 
between 0200 and 0300 UT, do not show any new object.
