report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We report on Swift-XRT observations of the field of the INTEGRAL
discovered GRB 131224A (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ 15607), starting 10.8
ks after the trigger.

XRT began observing the field on 2013-12-24 at 19:53:56 UT (10.8 ks after
trigger), with an exposure time of of 3.96 ks. No source is detected
within the INTEGRAL error circle. The 3-sigma upper limit on the count
rate is 3.5E-03 cts/s, which is 1.4E-13 erg cm^-2  s^-1  using a typical
flux conversion of 4E-11 erg cm^-2  count^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
