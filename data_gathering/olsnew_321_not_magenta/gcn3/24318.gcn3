 We checked the KMTNet image at the location of the UVOT transient
(Breeveld et al., GCN Circ. 24296). The image was taken at 2019-04-25
14:05:29 (UT) at the KMTNet Siding Spring Observatory station, about 6
hours after the GW detection (LVC collaboration, GCN Circ. 24168) and 28
hours before the reported UVOT detection. We do not find any transient at
the UVOT location down to the preliminary magnitude limit of R<21.5
(3-sigma, point source). We do find the reported faint host galaxy
candidate in our KMTNet data (Palmese et al., GCN Circ. 24312)

 We thank the KMTNet operators for performing the observation.
