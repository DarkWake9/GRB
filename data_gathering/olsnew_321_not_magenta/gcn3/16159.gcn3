D. Xu (DARK/NBI), C.-H. Bai, X. Zhang, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the BAT/XRT field of the Swift Trigger 596958 using the 1m
telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Three 120s R-band
frames were obtained in a seeing of ~2 aecsec, starting at 21:41:20 UT
on 2014-03-24.

The XRT error circle is nicely on the central part of the very bright
flare star V* DG CVn, and the 2XMM J133146.4+291635 X-ray source is
just within the XRT error circle (using the SIMBAD database). We think
V* DG CVn and 2XMM J133146.4+291635 are the identical object.
Comparing the DSS II, SDSS DR10, and Nanshan images, it's clear that
the star has a proper motion towards the South-West direction.
