Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161108A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 721234) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 449s after the GRB trigger
The elevation of the field increased from 28 degrees
above horizon and weather conditions were good.

We co-added a series of exposures but we did not detect the
afterglow candidate of Malesani et al. (GCNC 20146).
TAROT limiting magnitudes are:

t0+ 449s to t0+ 539s : Rlim = 18.5
t0+1271s to t0+1941s : Rlim = 19.5
t0+1952s to t0+3694s : Rlim = 19.5
t0+3705s to t0+6041s : Rlim = 19.5

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
