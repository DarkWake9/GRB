D. M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:42:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190816A (trigger=920783).  Swift did not slew due to an observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 341.193, -29.740, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 44m 46s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 44' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a couple peaks
with a total duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 17:11 UT on 2019 August 17. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (klp5 AT leicester.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
