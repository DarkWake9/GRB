NUMBER:  2876
SUBJECT: GRB041219: Confirmed NIR Afterglow
DATE:    04/12/19 17:45:16 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

Dae-Sik Moon, S. Bradley Cenko (Caltech), and Joe Adams (Cornell) report
on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We have imaged the field of  GRB041219 with the Wide Field Infrared
Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope.  We can confirm the
presence of a fading source at the position reported by Blake and Bloom
(GCN 2870).  Our K_s magnitudes (with reference to the 2MASS catalog) are
as follows:

UT (Dec 19)      t_burst       K_s Magnitude
----------------------------------------------------
02:31:52         0.8 h         14.9
03:16:01         1.55 h        15.5


This corresponds to a decay index of ~ 0.8"
