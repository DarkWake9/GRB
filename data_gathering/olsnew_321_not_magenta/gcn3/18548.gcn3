J. Greiner (MPE), M. Wieringa (CSIRO), P. Wiseman (MPE) report for a  
larger consortium: 
 
We observed the field of GRB 151027B (Swift trigger 661869; Ukwatta et 
al., GCN 18499) simultaneously at 5.5 and 9 GHz with the Australia  
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), beginning at October 30.54 UT for 3.3 hrs.  
 
At a mean frequency of 9 GHz (with 2 GHz bandwidth) we detect a source 
at ~67+/-10 microJy at the position of the optical afterglow (Malesani  
et al., GCN 18501; Wiseman et al., GCN 18507). At the redshift of z=4.063  
(Xu et al., GCN 18506) this is among the most luminous GRB radio afterglows. 
 
We are grateful to P. Edwards for scheduling this observation.
