and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170820A (Konus-Wind trigger time on 11:12:06.755 UT)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:12:05.10 on
20 August 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at
T+1 sec, peaks at T+4.5 sec and ends at T+9 sec.  There is a hint of the
peaked emission at T+8 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the
SGM data is 4.1 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
