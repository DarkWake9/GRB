TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030216 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 58424 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 3
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.4E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 171.796, +41.728 degrees, whose radius is 50.029 +/-  0.127
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
