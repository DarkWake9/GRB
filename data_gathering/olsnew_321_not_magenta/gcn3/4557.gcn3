J. S. Bloom, K. Alatalo (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger  
collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 060121 (Arimoto et al., GCN 4550;  
Prigozhin et al. GCN 4551) with the 1.3 meter Peters Automated  
Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona,  
beginning at 2006-01-22 04:43:15 UT. In a stack of the first 345  
seconds of integration, we find no new objects in the HETE-SXC error  
circle in JHKs bands brighter than the 2MASS detection levels. All  
significantly detected sources fainter than 2MASS have optically pre- 
imaged counterparts from SDSS (Cool et al. GCN 4554). Our approximate  
10 sigma detection levels are J=18.7, H=17.6, Ks=16.6 mag,  
respectively."
