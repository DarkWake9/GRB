M. M. Chester (Penn State) and R. L. C. Starling (U. Leicester) report on 
behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 2115 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers
100% of the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about
19.6 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers
100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to
about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.
