The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration report:

We have updated the skymap for the compact binary merger candidate S190828j
(GCN 25497). The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190828j/

bayestar.fits.gz is the preferred sky map at this time and can be retrieved
from the

GraceDB event page:

 * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR [1],
distributed via GCN update notice about 1.5 hours after the candidate

The 90% credible region is 587 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1803 +/- 423 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

Note that S190828j (GCN 25497) and S190828l (GCN 25503) are distinct events
that occurred 21 minutes apart.
