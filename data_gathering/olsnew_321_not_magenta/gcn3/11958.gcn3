E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI)  on behalf of  larger GRB follow up 
collaboration report:

We started observation of the field of GRB 110422A (Mangano  et al. GCN 
11957) with AZT-33IK on Apr. 22 (UT) 15:58.    We detected new object, not 
presented in DSS2 in coordinates (J2000) 07 28 10.972 +75 06 24.87 with 
statistical uncertainty of 1" in booth coordinates. The object is close to 
the current XRT position. The first image was unfiltered, while after 
detection we started several series in R-filter. The brightness of the 
object in the first image taken 16 min after burst onset is R=18.3 in 
comparison with nearby USNOB-1.0 field stars. We suggest that the object is 
the afterglow of GRB 110422A.
