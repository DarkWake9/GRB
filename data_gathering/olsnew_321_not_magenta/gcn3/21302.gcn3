Max Genecov, WeiKang Zheng, and Alex Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 170705A (Starling, et al.,GCN
21289), starting 1.66 hours after the burst and again 1.08
days after the burst. Observations were performed in the clear
(roughly R) filter, and the exposure time was 60 s per image.

The optical afterglow of GRB 170705A (Starling, et al.,GCN 21289;
Lipunov et al., GCN 21291; Butler et al. GCN 21293,
Emery et al. GCN 21294, Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN 21298, Pozenenko
et al. GCN 21300) was clearly detected in every single image from the
first night and in an image co-added from thirteen frames in the
second night. Preliminary photometry of the afterglow calibrated to
several nearby SDSS stars gives 18.1 +/- 0.2 mag at mean time
1.66 hours and 20.3 +/- 0.3 mag at mean time 1.08 days.
