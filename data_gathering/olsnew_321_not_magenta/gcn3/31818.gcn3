The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:10:02 UT on 3 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220403A (trigger 670673407.661128 / 220403424).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 56.5, Dec = -44.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 46m, -44d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 14.0 degrees.
