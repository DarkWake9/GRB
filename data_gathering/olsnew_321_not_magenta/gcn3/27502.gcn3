The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:22:01 UT on 7 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200407A (trigger 607933326.481534 / 200407265).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 276.6, Dec = 5.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 26m, 5d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79.0 degrees.
