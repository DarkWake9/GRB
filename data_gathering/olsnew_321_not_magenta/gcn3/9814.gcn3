Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 090812 (GCN 9768) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz at two epochs, on
2009 Aug. 13.37 UT and Aug. 15.41 UT. The GRB radio afterglow is
undetected in both the observations. The peak fluxes at the P60
optical afterglow position (GCN 9769) in the two observations are
104+/-43 uJy and 63+/-62 uJy, respectively.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
