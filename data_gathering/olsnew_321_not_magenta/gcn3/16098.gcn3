V. D'Elia (ASDC), S. T. Holland (STScI), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA),
F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:09:40 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140413A (trigger=595616).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 65.449, -51.205 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 21m 48s
   Dec(J2000) = -51d 12' 17"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This is an image trigger and we cannot 
say much about the light curve.  However, since it is 12.5 sigma detection 
at 64 sec exposure in the image domain, it is likely to be real. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+33.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
