TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  455
SUBJECT: GRB 991208 - OVRO detection
DATE:    99/12/12 05:09:41 GMT

D. S. Shepherd, S. Jogee, S. R. Kulkarni and D. A. Frail on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Keck GRB effort report the detection of the radio
afterglow of GRB 991208 at millimeter wavelengths.

We undertook observations of the afterglow of GRB 991208 (Frail, GCN
451) with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array. The mean epoch of the
observations is UT 1999 December 11.58.  We detected a source with a
flux of 3.8 +/- 0.8 mJy at position alpha(J)=16:33:53.5 and delta(J) =
+46:27:21.2. This is coincident (within errors) with the radio
afterglow of GRB 991208 first discovered at the VLA (GCN 451). This the
brightest afterglow detected at millimeter wavelengths to date. We urge
observations at higher frequencies.
