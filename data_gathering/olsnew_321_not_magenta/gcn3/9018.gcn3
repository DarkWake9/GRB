Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 10:01:46 UT on 20 March 2009, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 090320A (trigger 259236108 / 090320.418).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 242.4, Dec = -51.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to
J2000 16h 10m, +/-51d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.8 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally
a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The GBM light curve shows a single peak  with a duration (T90)
of about 10 s (8-1000 keV). The reliability for T90 is low due to strong 
background fluctuations.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60 degrees.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly 
constrained."
