J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P. Wozniak, and H. Davis,
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR network of robotic optical telescopes made observations of Swift
trigger 541200 (Mangano, et al., GCN 14057).  The burst location was within
the field of our wide-field monitor located in Maui, HI, which began a 10 s
integration of the location at 03:47:00.17 UT, 2.8 s before the Swift trigger
time and during the gamma-ray emitting interval.  During the period that the
BAT was detecting gamma-ray emission, from ~T-5 s to ~T+200 s (Barthelmy,
et al., GCN 14067), we have a total of twenty 10 s exposures with limiting
magnitudes of R~9.8.  We do not detect the optical counterpart in any of
our images.  Our 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are based on a comparison of
our unfiltered image to the Tycho-2 V-band catalog.
