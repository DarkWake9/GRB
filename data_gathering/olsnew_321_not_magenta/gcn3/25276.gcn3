Y.-D. Hu (IAA-CSIC), A. F. Valeev and  V.V. Sokolov (SAO-RAS), A. J. 
Castro-Tirado and E. Fernandez-Garcia (IAA-CSIC), I. Carrasco and A. 
Castellon (UMA) and N. Castro-Rodriguez (GRANTECAN, IAC, ULL), on behalf 
of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of AT2019lvw (Goldstein et al., GCN 25215, 
Andreoni et al., GCNC 24235) within the error area of the GW event 
S190728q (LVC, GCNC 25187), we obtained imaging and optical spectra 
covering the range 3700-7500 A with the 10.4m GTC telescope equipped 
with OSIRIS in La Palma (Spain) starting on Aug 5, 04:00 UT.

AT2019lvw magnitude on Aug 5, 04:30 UT was measured to be r = 22.15 +/- 
0.05. The AT2019lvw 1200s spectrum displays broad lines and is 
consistent with a SN Ia at three-four weeks post maximum at the nearby 
host galaxy redshift (z =  0.270 +/- 0.001, based on the narrow emission 
lines from the galaxy).

Therefore AT2019lvw is unrelated to the GW event S190728q.
