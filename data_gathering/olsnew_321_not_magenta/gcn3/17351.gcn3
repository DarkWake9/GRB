team report:

The long GRB 150123A localized by MAXI/GSC (Fukushima et al., GCN
17345) was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse started at ~T0(MAXI)-39 s 
with a duration of ~70 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
7.42(-0.80,+0.88)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(MAXI)-1 s, of (1.6 +/- 0.7)x10^-7 erg/cm2 (both in the 
20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Fitting the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(MAXI)-39 s 
to T0(MAXI)+31 s) by a simple power-law model yields a power law index 
of 1.82 +/- 0.1 (chi2=1.0/1 dof).

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
