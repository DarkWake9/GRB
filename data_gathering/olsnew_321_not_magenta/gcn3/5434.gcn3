TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5434
SUBJECT: GRB060714: optical observations

I. Asfandyarov (MAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI), M. Ibrahimov (MAO) on behalf of
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed  the  error box of GRB060714 (Krimm et al., GCN5311)  with 1.5 m
telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory (MAO)  on July 14, (UT)
16:14 - 17:29. A set of 120 s exposures were taken in  R and B bands. The
afterglow (Krimm et al., GCN5311) is clearly detected in single R-images and
marginally detected in single images in B. A photometry of the afterglow
based on USNO A2.0 is following:

Mid time T0+ (d), Exposure (s), Filter, Mag.

0.0446676         1x120 R 18.70 0.07
0.0484408         1x120 R 18.63 0.06
0.0522834         1x120 R 18.77 0.07
0.0560218         1x120 R 18.88 0.07
0.0598528         1x120 R 18.91 0.07
0.0655589         2x120 R 18.86 0.06
0.0762707         3x120 R 18.87 0.07
0.0896677         3x120 R 18.82 0.07
0.0708077        14x120 B 19.87 0.04

Taking into account  early  Swift/UVOT  observations (Boyd et al., GCN5357)
one can suggest that during our observations the afterglow re-brightening
took place.
