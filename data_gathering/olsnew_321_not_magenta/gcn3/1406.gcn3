TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1406
SUBJECT: GRB020531, optical observations

D. West (Mulvane, KS), on behalf of the AAVSO International
GRB Network, reports:

The IPN error box for GRB020531 (Ricker et al, GCN 1399
and Hurley et al., GCN 1402) has been observed, using a
20cm telescope and SBIG ST-9E CCD under clear conditions.
Unfiltered exposures covering a 29x29arcmin field were
made; these frames cover 99percent of the IPN
error box, perhaps missing the extreme eastern point.
A series of 60sec exposures began at 0250UT on 020531
(2.4hrs after the burst), with the best 7 combined to
form a composite image.  No new source down to a V magnitude
of 17.7 (GSC1.1) was seen.
