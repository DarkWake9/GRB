and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160815A (Markwardt et al., GCN Circ. 19794;
Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 19797) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 11:45:10.86 on 15 August 2016.  The burst signal was seen by
the SGM instrument.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing
computer, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows several two peaks.  The whole emission starts
at T0 and ends at T+4 sec.  The two spikes peak at T+0.5 sec and T+3 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 3.6 +- 0.6 sec (40-100 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
