T. Laskar (Radboud U.) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31347) with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2022 January 04 04:00 UT (2.96 d
after the burst). At a mean frequency of 6.0 GHz, we detect a radio source
with a preliminary flux density of ~ 0.2 mJy at the position:

RA (J2000) = 00:05:24.816 +/- 0.005
Dec (J2000) = 31:46:08.37 +/- 0.02

consistent with the X-ray position (Osborne et al., GCN 31349), optical
position (Tohuvavohu et
al., GCN 31347; Hentunen et al., GCN 31356), and mm-band position (Laskar,
GCN 31372). Further observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations."
