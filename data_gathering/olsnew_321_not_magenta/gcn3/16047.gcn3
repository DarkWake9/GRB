report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

An on-ground analysis of the IPN triangulation of GRB 140329A (Hurley et. al. GCN16045), which was detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 417769481, GCN 16042) and initiated an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft, has revealed long-lived high-energy emission detected by Fermi-LAT.  The best LAT on-ground location is found to be:

RA, Dec 145.698,  -32.229 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.2 deg (90% containment, statistical error only). The burst was outside the LAT field of view at the time of trigger and remained so for an additional 2000 seconds.  The analysis above covers a period from 2000s to 5000s post GBM trigger and an energy range of 100 MeV to 10 GeV.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is D. Kocevski (daniel.kocevski@nasa.gov<mailto:daniel.kocevski@nasa.gov>).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
