IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches [1,2] for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate
S190901ap
 in a time range of 1000 seconds [3] centered on the alert event time
(2019-09-01 23:22:41.838 UTC to 2019-09-01 23:39:21.838 UTC) have been
performed.  During this time
period IceCube was collecting good quality data.  No significant track-like
events are found in spatial coincidence of S190901ap calculated from the map
circulated in the 1-Preliminary notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial  containment
of S190901ap ranges from  0.029 to 1.150 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
