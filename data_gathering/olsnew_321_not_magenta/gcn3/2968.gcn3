California, Berkeley) report:

"The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT; see Li et al. 2003, 
PASP, 115, 844) at Lick Observatory robotically observed GRB 050123
(HETE Trigger #3666; Hurley et al., GCN 2966). Three batches of
unfiltered images were taken, covering a 12.6' x 12.6' field centered
on R.A. = 10h30m31s, DEC = -11d 52'17" (J2000) (from 10:23:38 UT to
10:54:37 UT), R.A. = 10h31m33s, DEC = -11d 34'14" (J2000) (from
10:58:31 UT to 11:58:53 UT), and R.A. = 10h31m26s, DEC = -11d 28'28"
(J2000) (from 12:11:26 UT to 12:32:26 UT), respectively. We detected no
new objects in our observations when compared to the DSS II images.
The following 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are derived (calibrated with 
USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes) from selected images: R~17.5 mag for a
3 x 5 s grid image (6.6' x 6.6') started at 10:23:38 UT (44 s after
the burst), R~19.0 for a 60 s image (6.6' x 6.6') started at 10:30:36
UT (462 s after the burst), and R~20.0 for a 2 x 2 mosaic 120 s image
(12.6' x 12.6') centered at 10:51:57 UT (1743 s after the burst)."
