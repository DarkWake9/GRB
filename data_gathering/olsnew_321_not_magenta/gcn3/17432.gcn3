E. Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:26:24.28 UT on 10 February 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150210A (trigger 445299987 / 150210935).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 112.9, DEC = +12.4 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 07 h 31 m, 12 d 22 '), with an uncertainty
of 2.2 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 55 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single main FRED-like peak
with a duration (T90) of about 31 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.002 s to T0+31.681 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.05 +/- 0.01 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 3118 +/- 216 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.35 +/- 0.01)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.024 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 19.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
