report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the reported LIGO/Virgo 
S200302c event (GCN #27278). At the GW trigger time 
2020-03-02T01:58:21.38 UTC (denoted as T0), about 55.0% of the 
GW localization region was covered by the Insight-HXMT without 
occultation by the Earth.

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the GW counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales (1 s, 10 s) from the center 
of the LIGO-Virgo location probability map (RA=40.1 deg, DEC=70.0 deg) 
without occultation by the Earth, the 5-sigma upper-limits fluence 
(0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1 s:   3.2e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.4e-06 erg cm^-2

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1 s:   4.5e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.6e-06 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1 s:   4.6e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.7e-06 erg cm^-2

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the spacecraft.
