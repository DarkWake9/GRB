K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and T. Cline,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 12309 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approx. 5 s,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approx. 2E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak
flux over 0.5 s of approx. 7E-7 erg/cm2 s.  We have triangulated it
to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area is approx.
155 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  1 h 24 m  5.17 s     25 o  0 '  24.19 "  (CENTER)
  1 h 24 m  9.89 s     24 o 54 '  48.51 "  (CORNER)
  1 h 23 m 18.26 s     24 o 44 '  28.89 "  (CORNER)
  1 h 24 m 52.16 s     25 o 16 '  26.76 "  (CORNER)
  1 h 24 m  0.42 s     25 o  5 '  59.77 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
