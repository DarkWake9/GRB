E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and A. Scholz (U. of Toronto) report:

"We observed the position of GRB 051117b (GCN 4281) with WIRC on the du
Pont 100-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory starting on 2005 Nov
18.10 UT.  A total of 30 min were obtained in the Ks band.  No sources are
detected within the XRT error circle (GCN 4282) to a 3-sigma limit of
Ks>19.3 mag in comparison to two nearby 2MASS stars.  A single extended
source, which is also visible in the DSS, is detected about 0.8" from the
eastern edge of the error circle with Ks=17.9 mag."
