Swift has observed the region of Fermi J0703.5+0505 (Garrappa et al., GCN Circ. 28918), a possible counterpart to
IceCube 201114A, gathering 3.6 ks of cleaned PC mode data between 05:32 UT and 21:20 UT on 2020 November 18.

We find 2 sources in this image; the first is coincident with the 7th magnitude K0 star HD 53113 (according to
SIMBAD) and is not an X-ray source at all, but the result of optical loading from this bright object
(see https://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/xrt/optical_loading.php).

The second source is at RA, Dec = 105.7125, +5.0311 (degrees) which corresponds to:

RA (J2000):  07h 02m 51.00s
Dec (J2000): +05d 01’ 51.8”

With an uncertainty of 4.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This position is 11.2 arcmin from the LAT position,
within the 99% contour. This source corresponds to the position of 2MASS J07024956+0500399, which SIMBAD
classifies as an RGB star. There is no known X-ray source at this position, however the RASS 3-sigma upper limit is
the equivalent of 0.017 XRT count/s (0.3-10 keV), whereas the observed count rate is significantly below this, at
(5.9 +/- 1.9, -1.6) x10^-3  ct/sec. The source shows no signs of variability, thus we cannot identify it as a new,
outbursting or fading source.

Given this, we do not believe we have found an X-ray counterpart to Fermi J0703.5+0505 or IceCube 201114A.

The 3-sigma upper limit inside the 68% confidence LAT error circle is ~3.2 x 10^-3 ct/sec (0.3-10 keV). Assuming a
power-law spectrum with nH=3 x 10^20 cm^-2 and Gamma=1.7, this corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux upper limit of
1.4 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
