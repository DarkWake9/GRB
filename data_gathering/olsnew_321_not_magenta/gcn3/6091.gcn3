SUBJECT: GRB 070201: Proximity of IPN annulus to M31

D. A. Perley and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

The IPN annulus quoted in GCN 6088 passes within a minimum distance of 
45 arcminutes from the center of M31, and through the galaxy's outer 
spiral arms.   Given the close proximity of a previous extremely bright 
IPN short burst (GCN 4197) with the nearby spiral galaxy M81 and the 
possibility of a physical association of that event with that galaxy 
(Ofek et al. 2006, Ap.J. v.652 p.507; Frederiks et al. 2007, Ast.L. v.33 
p.19), further investigations are strongly encouraged despite the large 
time delay between the burst and the distribution of the coordinates.
