GRB 050813: Gemini Imaging

J. S. Bloom reports:

"Imaging acquired in i-band with GMOS/Gemini-N on Aug 14.4 UT under
program GN-2005B-Q-6 reveals a compact faint source 2.3 arcseconds to the
South-East of the centroid of galaxy C (Gorosabel et al.; GCN #3796). We
cannot confirm variability at this time but if it is at the redshift of
this galaxy (z=0.722; Berger GCN #3801) then it lies 16.5 kpc in
projection from the galaxy center, suggesting it is a viable counterpart
to the short-hard GRB 050813 (Retter et al., GCN 3788)."

An image will be posted shortly at

We thank K. Roth and the Gemini Observing Staff for assistance in
acquiring this data.
