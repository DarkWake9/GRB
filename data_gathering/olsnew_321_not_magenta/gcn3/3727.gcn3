The photometry of the GRB 050730 afterglow and comparison
star reported on GCN 3716 requires correction. The CCD gain
between the standard star and GRB observations differed by 20%.
The IMACS photometry of the afterglow taken on July 30 23:57 (UT)
should be R=17.73 +/-0.05 mag and the comparison star at
14:08:14.62 -03:46:29 (2000) has R=17.41 +/-0.05 mag.

The photometry of Burenin et al. (GCN 3718) based on our old
calibration should be made 0.23 mag fainter. Even
without these corrections, the R-band observations
imply a power-law decay index of -1.7 between 4 hours and
23 hours after the burst. This is much steeper than the V-band
index suggested by Swift UVOT photometry (Blustin et al. GCN 3717).
The Swift V-band data between 12 minutes and 6.5 hours after
the burst is consistent with a power-law decay index of -0.9.
If the spectral index has not changed significantly,
then the combined Swift and ground data suggests a steepening
in the power-law decay occurred between 6 hours and 23 hours
post-burst.
