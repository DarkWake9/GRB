We observed GRB200412B reported by Fermi GBM Team (GCN 27547) and Burgess J. et al, (GCN 27548) with 0.7m robotic GROWTH-India telescope. We switched from tiled observations to targeted follow-up based on the afterglow identification by Lipunov V. et al, (GCN 27555) at RA(J2000) = 18:33:15.33  Dec(J2000) = +62:31:57.0 . The field was observed multiple times in g and r filters with 550 sec exposure time, starting about 7.4 hours after the trigger. We clearly detect the afterglow emission. The decay is well-described by a power law with alpha = 1.05 +/- 0.14 for g band data and 0.85 +/- 0.17 for r band data.

We obtained the following results:
------------------------------------------------------------------
 JD(Start)| Exposure(sec) | Filter | Mag | lim_Mag |

2458952.1903 | 550 |  g  |  18.301+/-0.034 |  20.92
