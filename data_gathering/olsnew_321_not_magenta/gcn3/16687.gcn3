Hi all,

GRB 140814A: Swift-XRT and UVOT observations

V.Mangano (PSU), [UBS]
report on behalf of the Swift team

Swift began observing the field of GRB 140814A  (Uchida et al,.  GCN Circ. on 2014-08-14 at 13:35:33 UT, 22.08 ks after the MAXI/GSC trigger. A tiled observation of four contiguous fields centered on the MAXI i.e., about 1 ks per field. Our mosaic covers the whole elliptical MAXI error circle (Uchida et al., GCN Circ. 16686).
In the XRT exposure, we do not find any new source, down to a three sigma upper limit of 3e-03 cts/s.
