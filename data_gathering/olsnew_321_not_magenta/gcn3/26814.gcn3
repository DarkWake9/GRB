We obtained J and Ks band imaging of ZTF20aafqvyc/AT2020yq (Anand et
al. GCN 26767) found in the localization region of LIGO/Virgo S200115j
(GCN 26759, GCN 26807) with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC;
Wilson et al. 2003) on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. We obtained a
series of dithered exposures of the target on UT 2020-01-18 for a
total exposure time of 900 s in J band and 600 s in Ks band. The data
were reduced and stacked with a custom data reduction pipeline (De et
al. 2020). No source is detected at the source location down to 5
sigma limiting magnitude of J = 21.5 AB mag and Ks = 20.9 AB mag.
