report:

The 2-m LCOGT Faulkes Telescope North began observing the MASTER optical 
transient possibly associated to GRB160925A/Fermi 496473540 (Lipunov et 
al., GCN 19938) on September 26, 08:11 UT (0.6 days since MASTER 
observations). We confirm the presence of an uncatalogued object at the 
following position:

RA(J2000)=  22:28:17.82
Dec(J2000)= -14:56:56.6

with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcsec and R=16.17 +- 0.01 mag, I=16.00+-0.01 
mag, as calibrated against USNOB-1 star 22:28:23.443, -14:57:33.95 using 
R2=13.69 mag, I=13.00 mag.
Given its ecliptic coordinates (333 deg, -5 deg), with reference to the 
IAU Minor Planet Center we checked that there is no known minor planet 
or comet brighter than V=20.0 mag within 10 arcminutes at the epoch of 
our observations.
