TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2267
SUBJECT: GRB030528, BVRI field photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 11x11 arcmin field centered at the coordinates
of the SXC error box for the HETE burst GRB030528 (Villasenor
et al., GCN 2261) with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one
photometric night.  Stars brighter than V=13.5 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030528.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
However, due to the crowding in this galactic field, only
isolated stars will have decent astrometry or photometry.

As always, you should check the dates on the .dat file prior to
final publication to get the latest photometry.  We anticipate
one more night of photometry to be acquired during this week.
