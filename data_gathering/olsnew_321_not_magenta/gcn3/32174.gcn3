report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 01:03:28.68 UT on 06 June 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor

(GBM) triggered and located GRB 220606B (trigger 676170213 / 220606044),

which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (Tohuvavohu et al. 2022,

GCN 32167).


The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization (GCN 32165) is consistent

with the GUANO position.


The GBM light curve shows a single peak with a duration (T90) of about

0.9 +/- 0.4 s (50-300 keV).


The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.256 s to T0+0.768 s is best fit by

a simple power law with index = -1.28 +/- 0.07.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is

(2.9 +/- 0.4)E-7 erg/cm^2. The 0.64-sec peak photon flux measured

starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band is

2.8 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;

final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
