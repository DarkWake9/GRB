C. Pagani (U. Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 160509A (Longo et al. GCN Circ. 19403) in
a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is
1.7 ks, distributed over 7 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky
location was 560 s. The data were collected between T0+7.3 ks and
T0+7.5 ks, and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

Using 250 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT images, we find
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 311.75375, 76.10837 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  20 47 00.90
Dec (J2000): +76 06 30.1

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 24.8 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position, and 11 arcseconds
from the preliminary XRT position (GCN 19407).	The light curve is
consistent with a constant source of mean count rate 1.4 ct/sec. We
cannot determine fading at this time.

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.7 (+/-0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.6 (+2.3, -1.8) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 2.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.9 x 10^-11 (6.6 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     4.6 (+2.3, -1.8) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.1 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.2 sigma
Photon index:	     1.7 (+/-0.3)
