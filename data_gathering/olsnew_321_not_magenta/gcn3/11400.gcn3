The long GRB 101112A, (localized by INTEGRAL: Gotz et.al, GCN 11396)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=79831.681s UT (22:10:31.681)

The burst light curve shows a single pulse
with a total duration of ~15 s.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB101112_T79831/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (1.95 ± 0.45)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0,
of (0.85 ± 0.25)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.4(-0.7, +1.0),
and Ep = 107(-22, +39) keV (chi2 = 28/50 dof).

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.75(-0.6, +0.9),
and Ep = 132(-38, +72) keV (chi2 = 6/14 dof).

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
