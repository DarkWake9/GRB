D.M. Coward, T.P. Vaalsta, J. Zadko, A. Imerito, D. Blair, P. Luckas,

The Zadko Telescope team observed the field of GRB 090205
following the report by N. Gehrels and M. Perri (GCN 8525, 09/02/06  
14:46:05 GMT). Observations started at 09/02/06 16:38:29 GMT using an  
iKon DW436BV CAMERA without filters mounted on the F/4 1.0m Zadko  
Telescope about 17.6 hours after the initial burst trigger (GCN 8884).
The GRB field was imaged for a total of 4460s until dawn. In a 1100s  
stacked image, a candidate OA with 23.2(3) white magnitude was  
observed at the enhanced XRT position (GCN 8885). The OA magnitude  
was estimated differentially using nearby nearby USNO-B1 stars as  
references.

The same field was imaged 2 weeks later and the candidate OA was not  
detected.

The UWA Zadko Telescope is currently being commissioned.
