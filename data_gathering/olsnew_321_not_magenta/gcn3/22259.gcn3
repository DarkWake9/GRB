Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 171216A (trigger #797441)
(Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 22256).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 212.013, -50.500 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  14h 08m 03.0s
  Dec(J2000) = -50d 30' 01.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 63%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak single-peaked structure that
starts at ~T0, peaks at ~T+3 s, and ends at ~ T+30 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 30.0 +- 7.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.45 to T+33.47 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.30.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.8 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
