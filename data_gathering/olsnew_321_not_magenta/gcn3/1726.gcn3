TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1726
SUBJECT: IPN detection of renewed activity from SGR1806-20

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses has observed 5 short, intense SGR-like bursts on December
5 and 6.  So far, one of these events has also been reported
by Konus-Wind, and the center line of its triangulation annulus
passes ~10" from the position of SGR1806-20, and >5 degrees
from that of SGR1900+14.  We conclude that this burst indeed
originates from SGR1806-20.  As there is a hint of continuing
activity from SGR1900+14, we cannot at this point be certain
of the origin of the other events, but will attempt to determine
this as soon as possible.

The times of these events were:

December 5, 2002:  02828 s *
		   12925 s *
		   32992 s **
		   72064 s *
December 6, 2002:  63291 s *

* crossing time at Ulysses; subtract ~418 s to get Earth-crossing
  time if the source was SGR1806-20

** event also observed by Konus; this is the Earth-crossing time
