K. Yanagisawa (OAO/NAOJ), H. Toda and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report
on behalf of the Mitsume collaboration: 

"We have observed the field of GRB 060110 (Zane et al. GCN 4463,
Parsons et al. GCN 4477) with the three-color Mitsume 50 cm
telescopes at Okayama, Japan  in g', Rc, and Ic bands starting at
9:58 UT (T_burst+2.0h) until 10:12 UT (T_burst+2.2h) for an effective
exposure of 10 min (60sec x 10).  The observing condition was not good
due to clouds and the position near the moon.

In the co-added image, we could not confirm the OT candidate (Torii
GCN 4468; Bloom et al. GCN 4471, Rujopakarn et al. GCN 4472, Tanvir et
al. GCN 4473, Wozniak et al. GCN 4474) down to the following 3-sigma
magnutude limits:

 g': 17.6
 Rc: 18.0
 Ic: 17.3
