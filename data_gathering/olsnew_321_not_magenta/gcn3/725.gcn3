Teramo - Italy, report:  

Starting at June 20.86, the 4'x4' center field of the BeppoSAX 
error-box (GCN 718) was imaged in poor seeing condition using the 
TNT 0.72 meter optical telescope at Teramo. 
We obtained two 600 sec R-band images. The reached limit magnitude 
of the combined one is about R= 19. 

Neither the single images, nor the summed one, reveals any variable or 
new source when compared with the Digital Sky Survey (DSS-II).  
Further observations are planned.
