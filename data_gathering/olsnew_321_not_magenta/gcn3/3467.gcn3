on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

GRB 050525 (Swift trigger 130088) was observed by Swift BAT.  At the
present, only rate data are available.  This initial data indicate
that the burst was very intense (peak rate of 80,000 ct/s above
background).  The light curve consists of at least two ragged peaks,
with a total duration of approximately 10 seconds (15 - 200 keV).

Thus, this is not a short burst as initially speculated (Band et
al. GCN #3466), but it is one of the brightest bursts of the year.
