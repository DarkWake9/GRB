The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:09:32.48 UT on 26 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220326A (trigger 669960577 / 220326173).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 185.6, Dec = -31.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 22m, +-31d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 96.0 degrees.
