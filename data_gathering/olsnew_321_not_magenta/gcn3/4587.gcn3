N. Masetti, E. Palazzi, E. Maiorano (INAF-IASF, Bologna), 
E. Pian (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Trieste), E. Giro 
(INAF - Astron. Obs. of Asiago), C. Bonoli (INAF - Astron. 
Obs. of Padova) and D. Malesani (SISSA, Trieste), 
on behalf of a larger Italian collaboration, report:

"We have obtained R-band imaging and an optical spectrum of 
the OT (Kann, GCN 4577) of GRB060124 (Holland et al. GCN 4570; 
Mangano et al., GCN 4578) with the 1.82-m "Copernico" telescope 
(plus AFOSC) of the Astronomical Observatory of Asiago (Italy).
The seeing was ~2.5 arcsec during the observations.

The R-band observation started on January 24.970 UT, 
i.e. 0.31 days after the GRB, and lasted 600 s.
The OT was well detected; we measure for it a magnitude 
R = 18.5 +- 0.1 with respect to USNO-A2.0 star U1575_02242799,
which has coordinates (J2000) RA = 05 08 31.05, 
Dec = +69 44 27.9 and magnitude R = 17.3.

The 1-hour spectrum, acquired starting on January 24.917 UT,
is characterized by a smooth and basically featureless
continuum. No emission lines are detected; absorption 
features are possibly present, but their low S/N prevents 
us to confirm their reality.
