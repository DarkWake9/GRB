GRB team report:


SGR 1806-20 remains in the active state. Since the last SGR burst
041017, listed in GCN 2823, Konus-Wind and Helicon-Coronas-F have
detected seven SGR-like bursts in the trigger mode. Two of them were
also detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The most recent intense SGR burst was detected by Helicon-Coronas-F
today (041104) at 04:17:08.929 UT. Konus-Wind data aren't available
yet.

The following table summarizes the bursts:

           s UT                s      (20-200 keV)  (20-200 keV)  keV

*  -   the intrument, which detected the burst:
        K   = Konus-Wind
        H   = Helicon-Coronas-F
        I   = INTEGRAL SPI-ACS

**  -  the last column contains the values of spectral parameter kT
        for the OTTB spectral model: dN/dE ~ E^{-1} exp(-E/kT)

(a) -  this burst was also observed by Konus-Wind in the
        background mode. Estimated time delay is consistent with
        SGR 1806-20 position.
(b) -  this burst was also observed by Helicon-Coronas-F in the
        background mode. Estimated time delay is consistent with
        SGR 1806-20 position.
(c) -  We have triangulated it to Coronas-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
        RA(2000) = 225.846 deg, Decl(2000) = 44.432 deg,
        whose radius is 77.4 ± 4.0 deg (3 sigma).
        The center line of this annulus passes 0.02 degrees from
        the position of SGR 1806-20.

The Konus-Wind ecliptic latitude response indicates
that the source of the remaining bursts is near ecliptic plane,
so we suppose, that they are also originated from SGR 1806-20.

The peak flux of the burst on 041102 was nearly the same as
the peak flux of the brighest burst  detected by Konus-Wind
from SGR 1806-20 on 040828 (GCN 2693).
