Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200512A (trigger #971846)
(Simpson et al., GCN Circ. 27726).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 7.417, -2.217 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 29m 40.2s
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 13' 01.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure.
The main emission starts at ~T-3 s, peaks at ~T+3 s, and ends at
~T+40 s. In addition, there are some weak emission that lasts
until ~T+80 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 74.0 +- 14.3 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.86 to T+78.14 sec is best fit by a
simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.68 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.1 +- 1.0 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+3.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
