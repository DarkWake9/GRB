The Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) re-observed the field of BAT trigger 107873 
(also referred to as GRB050309; Barthelmy et al., GCN 3082), starting on 
2005 Mar 9 at 19:46:51 UT. Observations ended on 2005 Mar 10 at 9:10:40 UT, 
with a net exposure time of 15.7 ks distributed over 9 orbits.  (The first 
observation, reported in GCN 3082, was for 4ks). We report here the 
analysis of the second epoch data for the two possible X-ray sources 
discussed in GCN 3082 (Barthelmy et al.).

Source #1 is confirmed to be a real object, and its flux increased since 
our previous observation by a factor of ~2. Its refined coordinates are: 
RA(J2000) = 12:10:31.1, Dec(J2000) = +77:37:04.4.  This object coincides to 
within 1.4 arcsec with a USNO star with R~13.5, B~15.4. Its X-ray spectrum 
is very soft, well described by a power law with photon index Gamma = 3.2 
+- 0.3. The properties of this object are consistent with those of a 
Galactic coronal source.

With the additional data, it is now apparent that source #2 is an 
instrumental artifact.

Therefore, given the absence of any X-ray counterpart, and the low 
significance of the BAT detection, we conclude that this BAT trigger is 
unlikely to be a real GRB event.
