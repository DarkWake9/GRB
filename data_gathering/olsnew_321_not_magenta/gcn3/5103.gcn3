(Leicester) report:


"The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope robotically followed up
 GRB060510B (Krimm et al., GCN 5096) and began observing
 2.8 minutes after the GRB trigger time.

 We confirm the detection of fading OT  at the location 
 identified by Mirabel et al. (GCN 5097) and Price et al. 
 (GCN 5101).

 The automatic "detection mode" procedure did not detect an 
 optical afterglow candidate in the XRT error circle (Krimm et al., 
 GCN 5096) reported by Mirabal et al. (GCN 5097) in the first 
 short-exposure R images.

 However, following visual inspection of subsequent co-added and
 single-frame images, the afterglow was clearly detected and found 
 to be fading.

 We estimate source magnitudes to be i'~20.2 +/- 0.2, at 31
 min post trigger, and  R~21.0 +/- 0.5 for the co-added image
 from 2.8 to 20.2 min after the burst (total exposure time 240 sec).

 Further analysis and observation are still ongoing."
