TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  994
SUBJECT: GRB 010222 HST/Chandra TOO

FROM:    Shri Kulkarni at Caltech  <srk@astro.caltech.edu>

Dear Colleagues:
 
This note is to inform you that, under the aegis of our HST AO-9 program,
we have requested observations of GRB 010222  (GCN 959) with the Hubble
Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  This burst with a
bright optical (GCN 962, 963) and radio (GCN 968) afterglow appears to
be particularly well suited for detailed studies of the afterglow and
the circumburst medium.
 
The Hubble observations involves six visits:  STIS/NUV-MAMA (Feb 26),
WFPC2 (Feb 28, March 9, March 15-19, TBD, TBD). In addition, a 30-ksec
ACIS Chandra observation is expected to be conducted on March 6.

We encourage parallel ground based observations of this burst so that
it will become a very well studied afterglow.  We will be supplementing the
HST and Chandra observations with detailed multiwavelength observations
at facilities to which our group has access (e.g. Keck, Palomar, MDM,
HET). In the radio, we are undertaking observations with the VLA, JCMT,
IRAM, Ryle, OVRO and Nobeyama.

Shri Kulkarni, Titus Galama and Fiona Harrison on behalf of a large
international GRB collaboration.
