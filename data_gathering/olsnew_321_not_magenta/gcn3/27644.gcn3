The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:49:50 UT on 25 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200425B (trigger 609526195.945476 / 200425701).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 304.6, Dec = 38.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 18m, 38d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
