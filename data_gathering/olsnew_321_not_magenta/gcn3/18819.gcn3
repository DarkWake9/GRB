report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160104A (Melandri et al., GCN 18815)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 11:46 UT on 4th January, 0.38h after
the BAT trigger, to 12:49 UT. The total exposure of 24.0 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the XRT error circle down to the limiting magnitude of
Ks=16.8 (Vega, S/N=3). The photometric calibration was made
against 2MASS field stars.
