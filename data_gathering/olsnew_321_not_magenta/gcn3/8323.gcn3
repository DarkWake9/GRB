collaboration report:

"We have observed the field of GRB 081003A detected by INTEGRAL
(Mereghetti et al. GCN 8314) with the 1.5m OSN telescope at Sierra Nevada
Observatory (Granada, Spain). The observations consisted of 6x300s in
I-band, 2x300s in R-band and 2x300s in V-band (5.07, 6.17 and 5.31h after
the burst trigger respectively). We do not detect any new optical source
within the Swift/XRT error box (Page et al. GCN 8319) down to 3-sigma
limiting magnitudes of I > 22.0 and R > 22.5. We note, however that there
could be a marginal object (with low S/N significance in the I-band frame)
at coordinates (J2000): R.A.: 17:29:33.85, Dec.: +16:34:14.1 (+/-0.7"),
consistent with the XRT error box. Deeper observations would be needed in
order to confirm the reality of this source."
