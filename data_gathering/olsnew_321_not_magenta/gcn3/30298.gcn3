The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:33:01 UT on 22 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210622B (trigger 646050786.759848 / 210622440).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 126.5, Dec = -13.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 26m, -13d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 35.0 degrees.
