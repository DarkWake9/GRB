The MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope performed a follow-up 
observation of the BAT burst GRB080330 (GCN circular 7537, Mao et al.).
We received the GCN alert at 03:41:33 UT (T0+16s), data taking with MAGIC 
started at 03:42:47 UT (T0+91s), short after the prompt emission phase 
measured to be T90=61+/-9s. The observation was carried out at a zenith 
angle of 48 degrees. The observation continued for 1039s.

No evidence for VHE gamma-ray emission above the analysis threshold of
313 GeV was found. The observation was carried out in (less sensitive) 
moon-observation mode.

A preliminary analysis, for the hypothesis of steady emission and 
assumption of a differential photon spectral index of -2.5, yields the 
following 95% CL differential flux upper limits, including a 30% 
systematic uncertainty on the telescope efficiency:

E (175- 300 GeV): 0.36 * 10^-10 erg/cm^-2/s
E (300-1000 GeV): 0.49 * 10^-10 erg/cm^-2/s
for a time window from 03:42:47 UT to 03:59:01 UT

We can also exclude emission of a constant flux in any 100s time bin 
smaller than:

E (175- 300 GeV): 8.42 * 10^-10 erg/cm^-2/s
E (300-1000 GeV): 2.05 * 10^-10 erg/cm^-2/s
for a time window from 03:42:47 UT to 03:59:01 UT
