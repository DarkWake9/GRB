Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060719 (trigger #220020)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 5339).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 18.418, -48.383 deg {01h 13m 40.3s, -48d 22' 58.3"} (J2000)
+- 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 70%.
 
The mask-tagged lightcurve shows two peaks.  The first is FRED-like and
starts at T-1 and ends at T+5 sec.  The second is more symmetric and
starts at T+41 sec and ends at T+55 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 55 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+84.6 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 2.00 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.6 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+0.59 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
