S. Immler (NASA/USRA/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

Analysis of the merged Swift/UVOT data of GRB 060729 (GCN 5365, 5366,
5367, 5369) obtained on 2006-07-29 shows that the optical afterglow
was detected in the White, V, B, U, UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 filters.
The detection in all of the UVOT bands suggests that the redshift is 
less than
approx. 1.1. The photometry results are given for the 7 UVOT filters below:

Filter   T_start(s)  Exposure(s)    Mag

White     135           726        17.2
V     115         1,846        17.4
B     711           461        18.3
U     686           491        17.3
UVW1     663           491        17.4
UVM2     640           306        17.7
UVW2     730         1,088        18.0

Statistical and systematic errors are 0.1 mag each.
The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction of E_{B-V}=0.054 (Schlegel et al. 1998).
