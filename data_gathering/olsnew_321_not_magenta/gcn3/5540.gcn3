K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 The error region of GRB 060906 (Racusin et al. GCN 5528) was observed
with the 0.3m telescope in the New Mexico Skies Observatory.  Starting
at 08:39:08 UT (6.4 minutes after the trigger), 120s x 20 frames were
acquired through Ic filter.

 At the position of the optical afterglow (Cenko et al. GCN 5529,
5531), we identify a marginal excess (at 3.2 sigma) that corresponds
to I=17.7 (USNO-B1.0 magnitude) in a stacked frame (120s x first 10
frames). The analysis is preliminary.
