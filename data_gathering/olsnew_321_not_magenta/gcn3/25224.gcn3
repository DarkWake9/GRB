We report observations of the LALInf skymap of the BBH event s190728q
(The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration, GCN 25208,
25187) with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope (Chambers et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05560C). Images were taken in the PS1 w and i-bands (Tonry et
al. 2012, ApJ 750, 99).

Beginning at 2019-07-28 10:08:31 UT (58692.4226) or 3.4hrs after the
detection of S190728q, observations started in the w-band in the standard
NEO search sequence. At each pointing position a sequence of quads (4 x
45 sec) was taken. This observing sequence ensures exactly the same
pointing position for each of the quads. Observations of the map finished
on 2019-07-28 14:44:53 UT. On the following night, beginning at 2019-07-29
08:51:02 a series of 45sec i-band dithered images were taken to cover the
map. We finished observing at 2019-07-29 10:06:41. 

In total PS1 covered 105 squ. degrees of the LALInference.offline.fits,gz
map of the 90% credible region and we estimate we covered a sky region
totalling 92% of the event's localisation likelihood.

The images were processed with the IPP (Magnier et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05240) and difference images were produced using the
Pan-STARRS1 Science Consortium 3Pi images as reference frames. Transient
candidates were run through our standard filtering procedures, combined
with a machine learning algorithm (Wright et al. 2015, MNRAS, 449, 451)
were applied and all candidates were spatially cross-matched with known
minor planets, and major star, galaxy, AGN and multi-wavelength catalogues
(as described in Smartt et al. 2016, MNRAS, 462 4094).

We report the following transients which are all within the 90% contour of
the LALInference.offline.fits map. They are all supernova like candidates,
either offset from a clear galaxy or no obvious host. The majority of
these are detected over the 2 nights and do not show any fast fading or
rising. The redshifts below are all photometric from SDSS DR15 or GLADE.
For reference the redshift range corresponding to the luminosity distance
of S190728q (GCN 25208) is approximately 0.14 < z < 0.22.

The one exception is PS19dxf, which appears to show a fast rise and decline
of 1 mag in 33 minutes in the w-band images of the first night. This is
probably an M-dwarf flare, as it is coincident with an uncatalogued, red
and faint source in both Pan-STARRS and DECaLs imaging surveys. In
Pan-STARRS it is only detected in z. Star-galaxy distinction is not
possible, but a galactic M-dwarf flare is the most likely explanation for
this transient.
