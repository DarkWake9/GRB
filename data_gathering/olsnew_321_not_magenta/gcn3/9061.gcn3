The long GRB 090324 localized by SuperAGILE (Feroci et al., GCN 9029) 
triggered the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 02:47:17.604 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a double-peaked structure starting at
T0-1s, with a duration (T90) of about 70 seconds. We note that the
second peak starting around T0+50s corresponds to the FRED-like pulse
observed by SuperAGILE.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 8.8(-2.4, +1.0)x10^-6 erg/cm^2. The
1-s peak flux measured from T0+59s was 0.99(-0.12, +0.05) photons/cm^2/s 
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-1s
to T0+89s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of  2.0(-0.2, +0.3) (chi^2/d.o.f = 10.1/13).
From a time resolved analysis of the first peak (T0-1s to T0+49s) and
the second peak (T0+49s to T0+89s), we found that both spectra 
 were fitted by single power-law models.
There is hard to soft spectral evolution from the first peak to the
second peak; corresponding photon indices of the first and the second
intervals are 1.7+/-0.3 and 2.4(-0.3, +0.4) respectively.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
