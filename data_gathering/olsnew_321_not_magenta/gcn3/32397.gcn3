S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC),  K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL),
T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII),
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

After analysis of the full dataset, we have determined that trigger=1116172 (reported as possible GRB 220714A in GCN#32391)
is not an astrophysical event.  Instead, a known race condition in the onboard software caused the currently-active source Cen X-3 to be misidentified.
