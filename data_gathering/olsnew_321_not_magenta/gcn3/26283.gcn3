I observed the field of GRB 191123A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circular 26279)
with remote telescope T21 (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD + f/4.5 focal
reducer) of iTelescope.Net in New Mexico Observatory. Two images with a
luminance filter and with 120 seconds exposure time were obtained on
2019-11-23. Average time of images: 12:13:54 UT (5710 seconds after
trigger; Binx1) and 12:16:38 UT (5874 seconds after trigger; Binx2). I did
not detect any optical transients (magnitude limit of about 19.0 G from
Gaia DR2 catalogue).
