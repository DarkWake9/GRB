We observed the field of GRB 140423A (Sonbas et al., GCN 16142) with the
2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC starting at 23:32
UT on 23-Apr-2014. We obtained 2x150 s, 6x200 s and 7x200 s frames in
SDSS-r, SDSS-i and SDSS-z respectively.

The optical afterglow (
​e.g. ​
Elenin et al., GCN 16143) is clearly detected in our co
​-​
added images.

A summary of our photometry:

filter    t-t0 (hr)      mag
---------------------------------------------
  r       15.06       21.46 +- 0.03
  i       15.33       21.28 +- 0.03
  z      15.78       21.36 +- 0.07


Our photometry has been calibrated using an SDSS star in the FOV
(13:09:09.56 +49:52:13.38, r=19.76 +- 0.02, i=19.23 +- 0.02, z=18.92 +-
0.04), it has not been corrected for foreground extinction, and the errors
include the uncertanity in the SDSS calibration star.

Comparing our observations with those in the GCNs, we derive a decay
constant of alpha~-1.0 relative to the photometry published by Cenko &
Perley (GCN 16153;
​from ​
+1.4 hr to +15 hr), and alpha~-1.2 relative to the z-band photometry
published by Maehara et al. (GCN 16151;
​from ​
+2hr to +15.8 hr) and the R-band photometry published by Pandey et al. (GCN
16164;
​from ​
+6 hr to +15 hr), where a colour term of r-Rc~0.19 has been assumed in the
latter.  These decay rates are slower than those derived from the early
KAIT observations (Zheng et al., GCN 16156), who find alpha~-1.7 up to
about 6000 s.
