MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru)
located in SAAO was pointed to the  GRB170531.84 25 sec after notice time
and 99 sec after trigger time at 2017-05-31 20:09:15 UT. On our first (20s
exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box
(ra=121.258 dec=-14.0328 r=0.05).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 15.5mag


The observations made on zenit distance = 84 degrees, galaxy latitude b =
10 degree.
The moon (43 % bright part) is 19 degrees above the horizon. The distance
between  moon and  object is 41
The sun  altitude  is -56.5 degree.


MASTER-IAC robotic telescope (2x4 square degrees, MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru)  was pointed to the  GRB170531A (Evans et al.,
GCN #21170; Siegel et al. GCN #21172) 895 sec after notice time and 2115 
sec after trigger time on the 2017-05-31 20:42:48 UT.

The observations were made on zenit distance = 74 degrees during 
the twilight. The sun  altitude  was  -9.6 degree.
The moon (43 % bright part) is 58 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 41deg.

On our 5-th (180s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within SWIFT error-box (ra=121.258 dec=-14.0328 r=0.1).
The 5-sigma upper limit m~13.9mag (unfiltered) on the first image and


MASTER-OAFA  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in OAFA was pointed to the  GRB170531.84 15674 sec after notice 
time and 15751 sec after trigger time at 2017-06-01 00:30:03 UT. On our 
first (180s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within 
Master error-box (ra=121.25 dec=-14.0225 r=0.1).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 18mag
The message may be cited.


The observations made on zenit distance = 63 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
10 degree.
The moon (45 % bright part) is 38 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 43
The sun  altitude  is -35.4 degree.
The object can be observed till 2017-06-01 02:41:37.
