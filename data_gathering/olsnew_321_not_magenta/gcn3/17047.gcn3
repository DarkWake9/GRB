collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 141109B by Swift/BAT (Melandri et al., GCNC
17038), the robotic 0.6m MET telescope at the BOOTES-4 station, in Lijiang
Astronomical Observatory (China) responded to the event after the sunset,
with the first images being obtained about 3.5 h post-burst. Additional
R-band images (6 x 300s) were taken at the 2.0m Terskol telescope in the
Northern Caucasus starting 11.3 hr post-burst. No optical source is
detected at the refined Swift/XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCNC 17045)
down to the DSS limit. Observations at longer wavelengths are encouraged.
