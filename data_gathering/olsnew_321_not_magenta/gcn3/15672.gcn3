NUMBER:  15672
SUBJECT: GRB 131231A: Fermi GBM correction to GCN 15644
DATE:    14/01/03 19:03:04 GMT
FROM:    Peter Jenke at MSFC  <peter.a.jenke@nasa.gov>

P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM team:

"The quoted fluence (10-1000 keV) in GCN 15644 (P. Jenke et al) 
was in fact the time integrated average energy flux for this burst.  The actual 
fluence (10-1000 kev) for this event is (1.400 +/- 0.001)E-4 ergs/cm^2."
