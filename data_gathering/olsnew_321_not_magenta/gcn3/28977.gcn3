FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-201130A
(GCN 28969), the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 30.54 (+1.13 -1.31 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -12.10 (+1.15 -1.13 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 10.9 minutes
prior until 24.7 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations
are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
