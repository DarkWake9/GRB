We observed the field of GRB 140311B (Racusin, et al., GCN 15945)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from
2014/03 12.37 to 2014/03 12.52 UTC (11.52 to 15.25 hours after the
BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.84 hours exposure in the r and
i bands and 1.19 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with
the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 23.99
  i     > 23.82
  Z     > 22.85
  Y     > 22.26

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. In comparison to the earlier
detection of the optical afterglow (Xu, et al., GCN 15949) the GRB has
faded. A power-law temporal decay with an index of alpha = -0.94 or
steeper is required for our r-band upper limit to be consistent with the
earlier detection.

Mártir.
