V. Pelassa (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:01:44.47 UT on March 7 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130307A (trigger 384318107 / 130307126).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 153.7, DEC = 18.3 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to +10h 12m, +18d 16'), with an uncertainty
of 3.3 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.
An IPN triangulation will be issued in a forthcoming circular.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.64 s to T0+0.032 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.78 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 1670 +/- 350 keV
(Castor statistics 816 for 728 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.43 +/- 0.05)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64-msec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 9.9 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
