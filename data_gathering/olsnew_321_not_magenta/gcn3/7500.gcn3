We observed the field of GRB 080319D (Brown et al., GCN 7453)
with the 152 cm telescope located in Loiano, under unfavourable
conditions due to full moon light.

One Rc-band observation (1x600 sec) was done on 2008
March at 20.779 UT middle exposure time.

We do not detect any object at the position of the candidate
afterglow reported by Immler et al. (GCN 7458).
Our 3-sigma limiting magnitude is R~20 (based on the Nomad1 catalogue).
