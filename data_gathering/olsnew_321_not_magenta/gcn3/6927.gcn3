S.Shaw, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) 
on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A  short burst lasting about 0.5 s has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI 
data at approximately 00:58 UT on October 17
The coordinates (J2000)  are:

RA: 274.718 [degrees], 
DEC: -16.001 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin. 

We note that the X-ray source AX J1818.8-1559 is consistent with this 
position. This could be a new SGR or AXP in the galactic plane.
