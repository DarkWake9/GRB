We observed the field of GRB 200125A (Lien et al., GCN Circ. 26876) with the Italian 3.58m TNG telescope 
equipped with NICS in imaging mode. A series of images were obtained with the Ks and J filters on 2020-01-26 
from 05:25 to 06:39 UT (i.e. from about 17.9 to 19.1 hours after the burst). 

We detect a source at the following coordinates: 

RA(J2000), Dec (J2000) = 15:12:11.30, -08:08:38.5  (+/- 0.5”).

This position is consistent with the most updated XRT localisation (https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/ <https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/>). We assume 
this is the same source detectd in the optical by Watson et al. (GCN Circ. 26882). 

From preliminary photometry, we estimate for this object a magnitude Ks ~ 17.2 (Vega, calibrated assuming K = 12.1 
for the 2MASS star at RA(J2000), Dec (J2000) = 15:12:05.10, -08:07:06.9).
