Y. Urata, T. Tamagawa (RIKEN) report :
 
"We have observed the optical candidate reported by Kilmaritin et
al. (GCN 2715) with 1.0m telescope at Lulin Observatory (National
Central University, Taiwan). We obtain I-band images with 600 sec
exposure on 2004 16 Sep. 16.68 UT (16.3 hr after burst) and 17
Sep. 12.51 UT (1.5 day after burst). We can not find any variablity for
the source.  The brithness of the source are

                         OT candidate      seeing
     16 Sep. 16.68 UT    I = 19.6        2.0 arcsec
     17 Sep. 12.51 UT    I = 19.7        2.5 arcsec


 The limiting magnitude is around 20.1 which comparison with USNO A.2
red magnitude."
