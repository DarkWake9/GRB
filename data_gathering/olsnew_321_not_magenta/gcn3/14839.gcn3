G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) and J. Michael Burgess (UAH) report
on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 03:05:10.69 UT on 09 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130609A (trigger 392439913 /130609129),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cummings et al., GCN Circ. 14828).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.6 s to T0+2.8 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.2 +/- 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 59.5 +/- 7.3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.7 +/- 0.6)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.6 s in the 8-1000 keV band is 3.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
