TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3378
SUBJECT: Swift-BAT detection of GRB 050507
DATE:    05/05/07 23:35:07 GMT
FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <anl@star.le.ac.uk>

At 22:43:18 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050507   (trigger #118248).   The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA, dec 48.055,-11.073 (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including estimated
systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve showed a spikey burst
structure with a duration of  about 20 seconds. The peak
count rate measured by BAT was about 800 counts/sec in the 15 -
350 keV band.

Because this burst is only 28 degrees from the sun, the spacecraft
will not slew to this burst.
