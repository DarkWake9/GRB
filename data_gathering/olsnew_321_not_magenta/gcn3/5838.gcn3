As observed by RHESSI, GRB061121 (Page et al., GCN 5823)
had a duration of ~19s starting at about T0=15:23:28 UT.
The preliminary fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum
from T0 - T0+19s  between 30 keV and 3 MeV is a Band function with

alpha = -0.83 +0.24/-0.19
beta = -2.00 +0.18/-0.32
E0 = 390. +250/-150. keV
Epeak = 455. +/-115. keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 30 keV-3 MeV fluence is 4.88 +/- 0.41 E-5 erg/cm^2.
