V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), C. Gronwall (PSU), A. Y. Lien (U Tampa),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 19:51:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 220501A (trigger=1104842).  Swift did not slew to the
burst location due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 85.577, +14.033 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 42m 18s
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 02' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 60 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 07:38 UT on 2022 August 04. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. D'Ai (antonino.dai AT inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
