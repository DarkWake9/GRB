V.N. Yershov (UCL-MSSL), aN. P. M. Kuin (MSSL-UCL) and A. A. Breeveld
(MSSL-UCL), report on behalf of the Swift-UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 864 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate
afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =  15:38:59.60 = 234.74832
  DEC(J2000) = -20:10:54.3  = -20.18175
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.65 arc sec. This position
is 2.0 arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated
magnitude is 18.91 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.16. No correction
has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.15.
