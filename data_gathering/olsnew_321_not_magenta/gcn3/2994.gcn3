SGR 1806-20: low frequency GMRT results of 2005 Jan 16.

P. Chandra, D. V. Lal, and C. H. Ishwara-Chandra  on behalf of GMRT
observatory
report the detection of radio emission from the SGR 1806-20 with
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observed on 16 Jan 2005 at the
following frequencies:

240 MHz (Jan 16.25 UT):   96.1 +/- 22.5 mJy
608 MHz (Jan 16.25 UT):   30.7 +/- 5.0 mJy
1060 MHz (Jan 16.37 UT):  19.9 +/- 1.6 mJy

The values quoted here are after subtracting the nearby extended emission
contribution from the SGR 1806-20 and modifying the flux densities with a
Tsys correction factor of 3.87, 1.93 and 1.59 for 240, 608 and 1067 MHz
frequencies respectively. Tsys correction is needed because, within the
galactic plane the Tsys is dominated by Tsky, which is proportional to
Tsys-towards-SGR and the Tsys-towards-Flux Cal.
