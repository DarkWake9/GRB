Using the data set from T-239 to T+446 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180115A (trigger #805318)
(Cannizzo et al., GCN Circ. 22335).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 12.040, -15.632 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  00h 48m 09.6s
  Dec(J2000) = -15d 37' 55.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts
at ~ T+25 s and ends at ~T+70 s. The main peak occurs at ~T+66 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 40.9 +- 3.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+26.49 to T+70.28 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.66 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.6 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+65.96 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
