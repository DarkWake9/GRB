A. Goldstein (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 191001A (GCN 25913),
the reported position:

RA: 314.08 (+6.56 -2.26 deg 90% PSF containment)
Dec: 12.94 (+1.50 -1.47 deg 90% PSF containment)

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 27 minutes prior
until 2 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations are not
constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
