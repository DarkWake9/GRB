We observed error box of Swift GRB050117 (Burrows, et al. GCN 2951;
Sakamoto, et al. GCN 2952) with 1.5m telescope of Mt.Maidanak high-altitude
observatory. R-band images (5 x 300 s, 4 x 240 s exposures) were taken
between 15:48 and 17:21 (UT) Jan. 17. In comparison with DSS2 (red plate) no
new source down to R=20 was found in a stacked image within refined XRT
error box (Hill, et al. GCN 2955). More detailed analysis is in a progress.
