The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
161017A (Troja et al., GCN 20064) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Oct 18.14, Oct 19.33, Oct 
21.30 and Oct 25.31 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 20067), with 3sigma upper limits of 132 
uJy, 84 uJy, 63 uJy and 78 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
