A.Volvach (CrAO), A.Pozanenko (IKI) reports on behalf of CrAO-IKI-SAO GRB
collaboration:

We  observed the error-box of GRB050319 (Krimm et al. GCN 3117) on March 21,
and 24 at 2.3 GHz  and  8.4 GHz with RT-22 of Crimean Astrophysical
Observatory.

Upper limits obtained for the afterglow position (Rykoff et al. GCN 3116)
are approximately equal for both 2.3 GHz  and  8.4 GHz frequencies:

Mar. 21.69 (UT)  2 mJy (2 sigma)
Mar. 24.67 (UT)  2 mJy (2 sigma)

Results of observations are in an agreement with  GCN 3132 (A. M. Soderberg)
