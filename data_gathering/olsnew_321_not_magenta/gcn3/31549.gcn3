S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 220203A
has been detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and
Swift (BAT), so far, at about 76530 s UT (21:15:30).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  -----------------------
  RA(2000)    Dec(2000)
     deg          deg
  -----------------------
  Corners:
   323.108        5.323
   301.728        6.767
   285.535       -7.425
   301.509        7.331
  ------------------------
The error box area is 28.4 deg2, and its maximum
dimension is 39.6 deg (the minimum one is 47.5 arcmin).
The Sun distance was about 16 deg.

This box may be improved.

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
