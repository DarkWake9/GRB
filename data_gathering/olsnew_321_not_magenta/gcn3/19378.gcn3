B. E. Cobb (GWU) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 160501A
(GCN 19365, Cummings et al.) with a mid-exposure time of 4.3 hours
post-burst (2016-05-01 05:01 UT). Total summed exposure times
amounted to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

No source is detected at the position of the X-ray
afterglow (GCN 19365, Cummings et al; GCN 19369, Evans
et al.) to approximate limiting magnitudes of I > 20.7 and J > 18.5.
Magnitudes are calibrated using USNO-B1.0 stars in I,
and 2MASS stars in J.
