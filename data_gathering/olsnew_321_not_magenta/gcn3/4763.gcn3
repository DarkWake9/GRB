The long hard GRB 060213, which was localized by IPN (Pal'shin et al., 
GCN 4762), triggered Konus-Wind at T0=47469.517 s UT (13:11:09.517).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~60 s,
fluence 1.599(-0.082, +0.066)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.320 s
6.95(-1.84, +1.82)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+56.832 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.834(-0.045, +0.043)
and Ep = 1061 (-43, 83) keV (chi2 = 79.5/71 dof).

The spectrum integrated over the 1.024-s maximum
(accumulated from T0+0.256 s)
is well fitted in the same energy range
by  a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha = 0.458(-0.074, 0.070)
and Ep = 1230 (-94, 104) keV (chi2 = 61.5/61 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

This is one of the most intense GRBs detected by Konus-Wind so far.
