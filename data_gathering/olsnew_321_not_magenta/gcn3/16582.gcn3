We observed the field of GRB 140710A detected by Swift (trigger #603954; 
Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 16563) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T11 (0.51 m Planewave) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory 
(NM, USA).  

20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from July 10 10:35:00 (UT) 
about 18 minutes after the trigger and stopped on July 10 10:58:30 (UT).  We do not detect 
the optical afterglow both in the individual images and the stacked image at the enhanced X-ray 
afterglow position (Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 16569).  The estimated five sigma upper limit of 
the combined image (total exposure of 1200 sec) is ~19.5 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
