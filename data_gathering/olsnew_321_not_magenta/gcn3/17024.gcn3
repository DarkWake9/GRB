A long duration GRB 141102A (Swift-BAT detection: Cummings et al., GCN 
17020; Fermi-GBM detection: Zhang, GCN Circ. 17021) triggered Konus-Wind 
at T0=46296.656 s UT (12:51:36.656).

The KW triggered on the most intense episode with a duration of about 
0.6 s. There is a possible precursor at ~T0-80 s.

The emission in this episode is seen up to ~1 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB141102_T46296/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the episode
had a fluence of 1.43(-0.42,+1.28)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.022 s,
of 5.95(-2.53,+7.28)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the episode
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.58 (-0.61,+0.93)
and Ep = 444 (-192,+1246) keV (chi2 = 21/28 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -1.3
(chi2 = 21/27 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
