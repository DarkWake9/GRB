We observed the field of GRB 141005A (D'Elia, et al., GCN 16882) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/10 5.22 to 2014/10 5.27 UTC (0.05
to 1.34 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours
exposure in the r and i bands.

We note evidence of the source reported by P60 (Perley, et al., GCN 16884),
with marginal evidence for fading throughout the epoch of RATIR
observations.
Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
