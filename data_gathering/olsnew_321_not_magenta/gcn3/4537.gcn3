J. Haislip, C. MacLeod and J. Kirschbrown report on behalf of the UNC team
of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the error region of GRB 060116 (Campana et al., GCN 4519) with
five of the PROMPT telescopes simultaneously in UBg'r'i'Iz' beginning 16.2
hours after the burst under the automated control of SkyNet.  Each exposure
is 80 s long; the table below gives details of the observations:

Filter Telescope  Start (UT) Stop (UT)    # Exp   Total (hr)
 U       P2       00:47:38   07:52:08      272     6.04
 B       P5       03:37:19   06:30:20      114     2.53
 g'      P3       02:59:30   04:39:18      66      1.47
 r'      P4       00:47:41   07:53:25      163     3.62
 I       P1       01:44:18   07:52:13      245     5.44
 i'      P4       03:38:24   06:27:06      115     2.56
 z'      P5       00:47:40   07:53:14      161     3.58

In a 100 x 80s stack, at a mean time of 19.1 hours after the burst, we do
not detect the candidate afterglow (Kocevski et al., GCN 4528) down to a
3-sigma limiting magnitude of I = 21.6 based on 5 USNO-B1.0 magnitudes.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned at CTIO.
