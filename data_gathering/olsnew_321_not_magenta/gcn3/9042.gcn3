D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) reports:

On the night of 2009-03-27 (UT) I returned to the location of the 
afterglow of GRB 090323 (Updike et al., GCN 9026; Cenko et al., GCN 
9027) with the Nickel 40-inch telescope at Lick Observatory and acquired 
an additional series of 900s R-band exposures between 05:12 and 12:26 UT 
totaling 260 minutes of integration time.

While not clearly visible in individual exposures, the afterglow is 
detected in stacked frames.  Using the calibration star of Kann et al. 
(GCN 9033), I measure a magnitude of R = 22.63 +/- 0.18 at an 
observation mid-point of t = 4.36 days in a stack of all observations 
throughout the night, consistent with the absence of a break in the 
light curve reported by Kann et al. (GCN 9041).

I thank Mo Ganeshalingam for the exchange of observing time.
