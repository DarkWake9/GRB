A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) and E. Rol (University of
Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 050730 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at Aug 5 11.10 UT to 22.40 UT, i.e.
4.63 - 5.10 days after the burst (GCN 3704), and at Aug 7 10.96 to 16.00
UT, i.e. 6.63 - 6.84 days after the burst.
At the position of the radio source (GCN 3761), we measure a formal flux
of 61 +/- 30 microJy on Aug 5 and 72 +/- 43 microJy on Aug 7. However, the
North-South smearing at this declination is such that it is hard to assess
the reality of this 2-sigma detection. A combined map of these two
observations gives a formal flux measurement of 54 +/- 26 microJy."
