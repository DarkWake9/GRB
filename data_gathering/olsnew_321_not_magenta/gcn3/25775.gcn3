The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the position of HAWC-190916A (GCN 25766, 25768) in a time window 12 hours in duration centered on the burst time  (2019-09-16 19:14:19.000 UTC to 2019-09-17 07:14:19.000 UTC). 1 track-like event is found in spatial coincidence with HAWC-190916A
during this time period. This represents a p-value of 0.044 (1.7 sigma) with respect to an atmospheric background only hypothesis. Accordingly, 
this event would represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 5.2 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum are between approximately 1 TeV and 500 TeV.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.
