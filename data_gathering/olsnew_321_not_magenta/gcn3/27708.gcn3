The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:59:04 UT on 9 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200509C (trigger 610757949.499186 / 200509958).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 311.0, Dec = -3.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 44m, -3d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
