The X-ray observations of GRB 131202A (1) point to the possibility that it fulfills the IGC paradigm (2,3). A preliminary overlapping of its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity within the one of GRB 090618, namely an IGC prototype (4), gives an estimate of the redshift of z~10 (see Fig. 1 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig1.pdf). Continuous monitoring and complementary observations in all possible wavelengths are encouraged.

The extension of the validity of the IGC paradigm to very large cosmological distances has already been clearly demonstrated by the case of GRB 090423 (5) at z=8.2 (6,7,8,9,10,11): its X-ray (0.3-10 keV in rest-frame) luminosity again overlaps perfectly well with the one of GRB 090618 (see Fig. 2 http://www.icranet.org/images/GCN/GRB131202A_Fig2.pdf).
