C. Pagani & J. A. Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed the first 2.3 Ks of prompt downlinked data for GRB 070610
(trigger=281993, GCN Circ. 6489). Because of an Earth limb constraint, the 
spacecraft did not slew promptly to the BAT position and the XRT observations 
started 3.2 Ks after the BAT Trigger.

In the BAT error circle we find an uncatalogued source at position
RA, Dec 298.7900, 26.2351 which is
   RA(J2000)  = 19 55 09.6
   Dec(J2000) = +26 14 06.3
with an uncertainty of 8.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).

The XRT position is 77arcsec from the BAT on board position (GCN Circ. 6489), 
within the BAT error circle. We are waiting for additional downlinked data to 
assess the fading behavior of the proposed X-ray afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
