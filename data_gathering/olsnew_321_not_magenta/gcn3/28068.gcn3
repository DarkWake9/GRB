SUBJECT: GRB 200707A: Fermi GBM Final Localization
DATE:    20/07/07 03:21:08 GMT
FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

At 01:44:02.54 UT on 07 July 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200707A (trigger 615779047 / 200707072).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 80.8, Dec = -14.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 23m, -14d 53'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 3.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13 degrees.
