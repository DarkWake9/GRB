report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140206A (A. Y. Lien et al., GCNC 15784) with
the
optical three color (g, Rc, and Ic) CCD cameras mounted on the MITSuME 50 cm
telescope of Akeno Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.

The observation started on 2014-02-06 15:46:53 UT ( ~8.5 hour after the
burst) and we detected the previously reported afterglow.
The measured magnitudes were listed as follows.

T0+[hour]     MID-UT      T-EXP[sec]          g'
Rc               Ic

(The photon flux were calibrated by SDSS(g') and GSC2.3(Rc, Ic) catalog.)
