"Pi of the Sky" apparatus has moved to the Swift-BAT trigger 132247
and it has taken series of 10s exposures starting 60s after the GRB
(40s after the alert). No new object has been found within
the Swift-BAT error box. The limiting magnitude is 11.5m (unfiltered)
for single exposures and 12.5m for the sum of 10 images. However,
the GRB counterpart might be hidden in the glow of 10.2m star
GSC 01071-00926 (BD +8 4298), which is within the error box.
