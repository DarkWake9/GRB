We observed the field of GRB 160303A (Beardmore, et al., GCN 19126) with 
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) 
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico 
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/03 4.12 to 2016/03 4.53 
UTC (16.00 to 25.72 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 
5.52 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 2.27 hours exposure in the 
Z, Y, J, and H bands.

The source reported by Butler et al. (GCN 19131) is not detected in our 
images. In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain 
the following upper limits (3-sigma):

   r    > 23.77
   i    > 23.88
   Z    > 22.37
   Y    > 21.77
   J    > 21.52
   H    > 21.45

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic 
extinction in the direction of the GRB. Our upper limits are consistent 
with the GROND measurements (Graham et al., GCN 19144) and confirm that 
the source was the afterglow of GRB160303A.

Mártir.
