K.L. Page, J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and S.T. Holland (CRESST/USRA/GSFC) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The possible BAT Slew Survey burst GRB 081211B has been observed again by 
Swift, 8 days after it was first located. The source mentioned by Page et 
al. in GCN Circ. 8666 is not detected in 2.3 ks of XRT data, with an upper 
limit of 4.3x10^-3 count s^-1 (equivalent to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 
~1.6x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1). The decay slope is 1.6 +0.9/-0.6, 
incorporating the limit placed by this non-detection. We therefore confirm 
that the source has faded.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
