P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:41:37.57 UT on September 1 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst 
Monitor triggered and located 
GRB 140901A (trigger 431293300/140901821). The GBM on-ground 
location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with
the IPN Triangulation (K. Hurley et al. 2014, GCN 16761).

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight is 
97 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak with a duration
(T90) of about 0.16 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+0.19 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 1250 +/- 70 keV,
Alpha =-0.30 +/- 0.04 and Beta = -3.0 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 50 +/- 2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
