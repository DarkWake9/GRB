D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), Konus-Wind, RHESSI, and INTEGRAL
(SPI-ACS) observed this GRB at 36720 seconds (GCN 1941, 1942).  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 50 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.1E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  6.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 1000 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  17 h 51 m 58.46 s    -25 o 14 '  24.52 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 17 h 51 m 05.79 s    -25 o 26 '  56.97 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 17 h 57 m 39.45 s    -23 o 22 '  49.88 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 17 h 47 m 34.20 s    -26 o 42 '  28.35 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 17 h 52 m 52.62 s    -25 o 01 '  24.10 " 

The Ulysses-Konus annulus may be used to constrain the IBIS error circle
(GCN 1941) and reduce its area by a factor of about 1.8, to
44 sq. arcmin.  The intersection points are:

   RA (2000)            DEC (2000)
17 h 51 m 24.08 s      -25 o 21 '  09.30 " 
17 h 51 m 47.70 s      -25 o 13 '  40.69 " 
17 h 51 m 42.63 s      -25 o 23 '  33.78 " 
17 h 52 m 03.80 s      -25 o 16 '  51.37 " 


A map will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn/030320.  This
error box may be improved.
