H. A. Krimm (NSF/USRA), K. L. Page (U Leicester),
M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 20:27:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located trigger 773082.  Swift will not slew to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 237.018, -45.634 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 48m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 38' 01"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This location is marginally consistent with the position
of the X-ray binary IGR J15479-4529. As is common with an image trigger, the BAT
light curve does not show any significant structure. 

Due to the marginal significance of the BAT detection (6.2 sigma),
the lack of a rate trigger and the distance to the putative source 
(9.5 arcmin), we believe that this is merely a statistical fluctuation 
not an astrophysical source.
