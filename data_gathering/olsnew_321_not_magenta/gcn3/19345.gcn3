and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160422A (Burns et al., GCN circ. 19331; Yassine et al., 
GCN circ. 19329; INTEGRAL-ACS #7450) triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) 
at 11:59:08.28 on 22 April 2016.  The burst signal was only seen by the SGM instrument.  
This fact is consistent that the GRB location of the Fermi-LAT (Yassine et al., 
GCN circ. 19329) was outside the field of view of the CALET CALorimeter (CAL) instrument, 
which has the capability to observe gamma-rays above 1 GeV, at the trigger time.  
The boresight angle of the SGM to the Fermi-LAT position was ~105 deg.  

The light curve of the SGM shows at least two episodes.  The first episode starts at 
T0-7 sec, peaks at T0-6 sec and ends at T0-4 sec.  The second episode shows the emission 
starting at T0, peaking at T0+1 sec and ending at T0+4 sec.  The T90 duration measured by 
the SGM data is 8.7 +- 0.3 sec (100-1000 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
