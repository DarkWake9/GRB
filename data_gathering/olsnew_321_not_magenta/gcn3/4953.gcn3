of Roma "Tor Vergata"), S. Galleti, R. Gualandi (INAF
Bologna) and G. Pizzichini (INAF/IASF Bologna) report:

Using the 152 cm Loiano telescope equipped with the
BFOSC camera system, we obtained in poor sky conditions
(seeing = 2.7 arcsecs) two Rc-band images (2 x 900 sec) of
the field of the GRB060403 (Boyd et al., GCN 4945, Mangano
et al., GCN 4947) starting at April 4.0778 and 4.0898
respectively. A preliminary comparison with the DSS-2 does
not reveal any new source brighter than the DSS-2 limit
within 1' from the XRT location. Our co-added image reaches
a detection limit slightly deeper than Rc=19.
The Rc co-added image has been posted in our public
directory from where it can be retrieved by sftp using:
