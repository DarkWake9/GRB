The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:00:23 UT on 10 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190610C (trigger 581889628.68482 / 190610834).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 314.8, Dec = -15.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 59m, -15d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 95.0 degrees.
