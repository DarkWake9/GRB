R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Fermi/Swift GRB 220711B (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 32365; D'Ai et al., GCN 32366) field with the Teide Observatory, Tenerife site, on July 11, from 21:05 to 21:23 (corresponding to 2.82 to 3.12 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS r and i filters.

We performed a series of 2x335s exposures in i and r bands.  We do not detect an optical counterpart within the XRT error region (D'Ai et al., GCN 32366) in either band.

The following upper limits are calculated using the PanSTARRS catalog as reference:

r>21.54
i>21.34

These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682
