TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1464
SUBJECT: GRB020801: Candidate OT present in DSS
DATE:    02/08/02 19:42:03 GMT
FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

Derek Fox (Caltech) and Paul Price (RSA/ANU) report:

"The OT candidate for GRB020801 (HETE Triggers 2177 and 2178) reported
by Kilmartin & Gilmore (GCN 1462) is detected in the Digitized Sky
Survey (POSS-II) N-emulsion (~I-band) image at a similar magnitude to
that seen in their finding chart.  Given the unfiltered nature of
their observations it seems likely that this represents a redetection
of the DSS source rather than a new source and candidate OT."
