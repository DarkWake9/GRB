report:

The 30cm robotic telescope FRAM-Auger in Malargue
(Argentina) reacted robotically to the Swift/BAT alert
of GRB200219A (Lien et al., GCNC 27125, D'Elia et al.,
GCNC 27139, and Bissaldi et al., GCNC 27137), starting
with a series of 20s unfiltered images at 07:43:16 UT,
i.e. 6.45 min post trigger.

We do not detect any new or strongly variable source at
or around the reported gamma-ray errorbox at single
frames or a combined 20 x 20s image taken between 6.45
min and 15.39 min after the initial trigger. The
combined exposure has a limiting magnitude r'(AB) =
18.9, as calibrated against the APASS Catalogue.
