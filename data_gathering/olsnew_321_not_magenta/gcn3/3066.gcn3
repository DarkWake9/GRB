larger collaboration:

"On 2005 Feb. 27.09 UT we carried out follow-up observations with the
VLA at 8.46 GHz centered on the afterglow (GCN 3031,3034)
of XRF/GRB 050215B (GCN 3024,3053). Within a circle of 1-arcsec radius
there are no radio sources to a 3-sigma limit of 156 microJy.

No further observations are planned."
