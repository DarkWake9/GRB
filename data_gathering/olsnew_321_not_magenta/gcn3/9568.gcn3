The bright, long GRB 090618 was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky
Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV
at 08:28:25.592 UT (=T0).
The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
starting at T0-5 s and ending at T0+149 s,
with a duration (T90) of about 105 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was (1.58 ± 0.07) x10-4 erg/cm2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+65 s was 20.7 (-0.9, +0.8) photons/cm2/s
and 9.83(-0.36, +0.26) x10-5 erg/cm2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-5 s
to T0+149 s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.32 ± 0.04 (chi2/d.o.f = 51/51).
The 1-s peak spectrum is well fitted by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
alpha: 1.21 ± 0.13, and
Epeak: 623 (-39, +44) keV (chi2/d.o.f. = 41/50).

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 3% systematic error
was added for low energy channels.
All the quoted errors are at 90% confidence level,
