TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2894
SUBJECT: GRB 041219: WSRT Radio Afterglow Detection
DATE:    04/12/21 13:41:10 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam), E. Rol (University of
Leicester) and R. Strom (ASTRON, University of Amsterdam) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the INTEGRAL GRB 041219 (GCN 2866) at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on December 20 from 15.55 to 23.59
UT, i.e. 1.59 - 1.93 days after the burst.
We detect a radio source at the position of the infrared afterglow
reported by Bloom et al. (GCN 2893) with an average flux density of 205
+/- 20 microJy,
and a probable increase in the flux density during the observation.
This measurement is in agreement with the radio detection at 8.5 GHz
reported by Soderberg & Frail (GCN 2881).

Further observations are planned."
