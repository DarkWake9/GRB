The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 14:58:34 UT on 19 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190719C (trigger 585241119.558452 / 190719624).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 244.5, Dec = 4.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 18m, 4d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 92.0 degrees.
