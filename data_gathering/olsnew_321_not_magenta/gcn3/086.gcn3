TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  86
SUBJECT: GRB980519 BATSE Observations

V. Connaughton (National Research Council and NASA Marshall Space Flight
Center) reports on behalf of the BATSE GRB team:
 
GRB980519 (GCN 74) was detected by BATSE on May 19.51403 as trigger
6764. The event lasted about 60 seconds and was seen as a series of
spikes riding on a single pulse for the first 20 seconds, followed by a
gradual decay. A peak flux of 6.94 +/- 0.25 photons cm^-2 s^-1 between
50 and 300 keV, integrated over 64 ms, places it in the brightest 12%
of BATSE bursts.  The fluence above 25 keV is 
2.54 +/- 0.41  x 10^-5 erg cm^-2. The location is consistent with the
BeppoSAX-WFC position in GCN 74 & 75.  A light curve of the event can
currently be obtained by e-mail from me at vc@msfc.nasa.gov, or will be
available next week at http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/~kippen/batserbr/
when the BATSE Web server is back in operation.
