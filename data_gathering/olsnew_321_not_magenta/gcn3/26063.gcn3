K. L. Page (U Leicester), J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (Toronto) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 04:42:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191024A (trigger=931242).  Swift slewed to the burst after
a delay to clear the Earth limb observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 10.147, -67.139 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 40m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = -67d 08' 21"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The first 8 seconds of the BAT light curve 
showed a FRED structure structure with an extrapolated duration of 
about 12 sec.  (Further light curve data will not be available until
the full dataset is downlinked to the ground.)  The peak count rate
was ~2000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:56:41.7 UT, 829.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 10.11387, -67.14323 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 40m 27.33s
   Dec(J2000) = -67d 08' 35.6"
with an uncertainty of 4.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 48 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 832 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.02.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
