S. Kulkarni, A. Soderberg and D. Fox report on behalf of the
Caltech/Carnegie/NRAO collaboration:

"As part of our large HST program on GRBs and XRFs, we have used ACS to
observe the fields of XRF 040701 and XRF 040812.  Observations were
taken in the F625W (r) and F775W (i) filters 39 and 60 days after the
burst (XRF040701) and 32 and 54 days after the burst (XRF040812).
Comparison of the two epochs for each XRF does not reveal a variable
source within the 1-arcsec position of the putative Chandra X-ray
afterglow candidates (GCNs 2630 and 2655 for XRFs 040701 and 040812,
respectively).  Our 3-sigma limits are the following:

	XRF		Filter		Limit:
 	==============================================
  	040701		F625W		27.5
			F775W		27.0
	040812		F625W		27.5
			F775W		27.0
