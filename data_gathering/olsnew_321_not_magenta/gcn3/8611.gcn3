The long GRB 081203A (Parsons et al., GCN 8595, Ukwatta et al., GCN 
8599) was detected by Konus-Wind in the same trigger record as GRB 
081203B (Copete et al., GCN 8600, 8602; Golenetskii et al., GCN 8610) at 
~T0(KW)+260s.
(T0(KW)=49890.368 s UT (13:51:30.368). Correcting for the propagation 
time delay from Wind to Swift of 0.7s, one sees that T0(BAT) corresponds 
to T0(KW)+339.9s).

Since this burst occurred after the end of the time history record 
(=T0(KW)+229s) we do not have the light curve of this GRB with good time 
resolution. Instead we have KW multichannel spectra accumulated until 
T0(KW)+490s (that is until T0(BAT)+150s), which were converted to a 
3-band light curve with a time resolution of 8.192 s.

The burst light curve shows a weak emission starting at ~T0(BAT)-80s 
(=T0(KW)+260s), the main double-peaked pulse starting at ~T0(BAT)-14s 
(=T0(KW)+326s) and the decaying tail seen at least until T0(BAT)+134s 
(=T0(KW)+474s).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.05(-0.89, +1.40)x10^-5 erg/cm2
(in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0(BAT)-79s to T0(BAT)+134 s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV-3 MeV range) by a simple power law model
with index 1.54 +/- 0.08 (chi2 = 65.8/69 dof).
Fitting by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) yields
alpha = -1.33(-0.20, +0.27)
and Ep = 578(-290, +2398)  keV (chi2 = 61.2/68 dof).

The spectrum of the main pulse
(from T0(BAT)-14s to T0(BAT)+52s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV-3 MeV range) by a power law
with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -1.29(-0.13, +0.15)
and Ep = 497(-156, +383) keV (chi2 = 66.2/68 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
