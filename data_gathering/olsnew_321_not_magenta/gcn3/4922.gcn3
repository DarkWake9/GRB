L. Vetere (ASDC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
C. B. Markwardt (GSFC/UMD) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf
of the Swift-BAT Team:

At 20:16:40 on 25 Mar 2006 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
triggered and located a burst from SGR 1900+14 (trigger=202746).  
Swift did not slew to this location because it was determined to 
be a known source, and hence given a low merit value.  
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 286.828, +9.270
{19h 07m 19s, +09d 16' 11"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).
This position is consistent with SGR 1900+14 (3.3 arcminutes).
The BAT light curve shows a single spike with a FWHM less than
~200 msec at T_zero.  The peak count rate was ~1600 counts/sec
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.  This Soft Gamma-ray
Repeater has not been active since late 2002.
