The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:04:24 UT on 22 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200922B (trigger 622490669.239676 / 200922753).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 136.2, Dec = 28.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 04m, 28d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 40.0 degrees.
