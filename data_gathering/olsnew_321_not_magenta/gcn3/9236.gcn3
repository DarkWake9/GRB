We have observed the field of GRB 090424 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 9223)  
with
the 1.23m telescope at Calar Alto. The afterglow is clearly detected  
in BVRI-bands.
On April 24.87 UT the afterglow showed a magnitude of R = 19.3 +/-  
0.1, as
compared to stars from the USNO-B1.0.

Calar Alto is operated jointly by MPIA and IAA-CSIC.

Further observations are ongoing.
