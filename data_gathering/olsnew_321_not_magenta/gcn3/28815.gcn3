The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:51:24 UT on 31 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201031B (trigger 625859489.53606 / 201031744).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 44.2, Dec = 54.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 56m, 54d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 16.0 degrees.
