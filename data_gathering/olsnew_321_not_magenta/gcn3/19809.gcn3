We observed the field of the Fermi GRB 160816A (Mailyan, et al.,
GCN 19804; Racusin et al. 19802) with the Reionization and Transients
Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson
Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro
Mártir from 2017-08-17 06:15 to 07:44 UTC (12.8 to 14.2 hours after
the GBM trigger), obtaining a total of 0.71 hours exposure in the r
and i bands and 0.30 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift/XRT error circle (Kennea et al., GCN 19806),
in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the
following detections:

r = 21.05 +/- 0.05
i = 20.79 +/- 0.04
Z = 20.61 +/- 0.07
Y = 20.32 +/- 0.08
J = 20.16 +/- 0.09
H = 19.95 +/- 0.10

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. The source position is
RA,Dec(J2000)=21:29:38.549,+37:07:58.79 with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec.
Our position is consistent with the candidate reported from Guidorzi,
et al. (GCN 19808).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.

Further observations are on-going.
