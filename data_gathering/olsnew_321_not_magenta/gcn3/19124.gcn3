We observed the field of GRB 160227A (Palmer et al. GCN19098) using the
0.8m telescope at the McDonald Observatory. The observation started at
2016-02-28 03:03:38 UT, or about
7.5 hours after the BAT alert.
We identify the afterglow at the location of the UVOT detection,
and our preliminary analysis shows the afterglow
at R ~ 20.8 +- 0.15 mag in a stacked image of 21 x 3 min frames.
The mid-point of the observation is 2016-02-28 03:47.
The photometry is calibrated against a star at RA=194.74877
and Dec=78.68984 (J2000) with R=15.72, taken from APASS
catalog.
A second epoch data was taken at about 6 hours later, and the
analysis of the data is ongoing.
