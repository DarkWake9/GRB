Speckhard, A.Trotter, and J. A. Crain report:

Skynet began observing the field of GRB121229a beginning ~2 minutes after 
the burst using three of the PROMPT telescopes located at CTIO in Chile in 
B,R, and I.  No optical afterglow is detected in the early observations.

Calibrating to several nearby USNO B1.0 stars, and co-adding the early 
observations, the following 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are obtained, at a 
mean observing time of ~30 minutes post burst:

Filt	Time	3-Sig Limit
B	29.7m	>20.6
R	29.7m	>20.7
I	33.1m	>20.5


Further observations are ongoing.
