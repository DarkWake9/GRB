S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), I. Andreoni (JSI/UMD/GSFC), and M. Coughlin (UMN) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The location of the transient source AT2022cmc (Andreoni et al., GCN 31590) was observed with the Hubble Space Telescope beginning at 2022 Mar 8 20:12:21 UT (~ 25.4 d after discovery). The field was imaged with the Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in the F606W (UVIS) and F160W (IR) filters for 1044 s and 1059 s, respectively.

AT2022cmc is well detected in both bands. Using preliminary calibrations, we estimate AB magnitudes of F606W = 21.88 +/- 0.05 mag and F160W = 22.24 +/- 0.06 mag at this time. The source appears unresolved, without obvious evidence for extended emission directly underneath.

A second HST epoch to constrain the presence of an underlying host galaxy is planned for July/August 2022.

We thank the HST operations team for the approval and rapid execution of these observations.
