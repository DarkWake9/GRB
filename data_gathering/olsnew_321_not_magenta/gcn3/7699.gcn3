report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift started a ToO observation of GRB 080507 (Lapshov et al.,
GCN Circ. 7697) today at 14:05 UT.

We have analysed the first 2.5 ks of PC data and found a bright
uncatalogued source at RA, Dec = 233.68085, 56.43520
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  15 34 43.40
Dec (J2000): +56 26 06.7

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence;
astrometrically corrected X-ray position).
This is 90 arcsec from the SuperAGILE position.

We also found a second uncatalogued faint source at
RA, Dec = 233.662500, 56.420972 (118 arcsec from the
SuperAGILE position) and a third faint source at
RA, Dec =  233.612083, 56.428500  (217 arcsec from the
SuperAGILE potition), likely the counterpart of
SDSS J153426.68+562545.8.
At the moment data are not enough to say if these sources
are fading.
