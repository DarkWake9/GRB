GRB 980425: BATSE Observations

R. M. Kippen (University of Alabama in Huntsville) reports on behalf
of the BATSE GRB team:

GRB 980425 (IAUC 6884) was detected by BATSE on Apr. 25.90913 UT as
trigger number 6707.  The event consisted of a single pulse lasting
about 40 s with little resolvable structure.  Its peak flux (50-300
keV; integrated over 1 s) and fluence (> 20 keV) are 0.96 (-/+ 0.05)
photons cmE-2 sE-1 and 4.0 (-/+ 0.6) x 10E-6 erg cmE-2, respectively,
ranking it near the middle of the BATSE burst flux/fluence distribution.
The BATSE location is consistent with that of the BeppoSAX-WFC and the
reported SAX-NFI x-ray counterpart (GCN 61).  Please note that this report
has been delayed due to an interruption of BATSE data delivery from
GSFC.  Bursts are normally fully processed within a few days.
