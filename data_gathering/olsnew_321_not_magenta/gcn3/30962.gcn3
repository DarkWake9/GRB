The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:34:11 UT on 24 Oct 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211024A (trigger 656732056.398738 / 211024065).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 358.1, Dec = 3.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 52m, 3d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
