The bright SGR-like burst detected by Fermi-GBM at 15:00:28.44 UT on 13 
September 2013 (Collazzi, Xiong, and Kouveliotou, GCN 15228) was also 
observed by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL SPI-ACS, and Swift-BAT. The burst was 
outside the coded field of view of the BAT.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at RA(2000)=304.668 deg 
(20h 18m 40s)  Dec(2000)=+54.308 deg (+54d 18' 30"), whose radius is 
62.790 Â± 3.144 deg (3 sigma).  The position of SGR 1833-0832 (the 
suggested source of two GBM SGR-like bursts: GCN 15228) lies outside the 
annulus, and therefore this SGR is unlikely to be the source of the 
bursts. The position of SGR/AXP 1E1841-045 (=PSR J1841-0456) lies 0.230 
deg (0.2 sigma) from the annulus center line and 3.89 deg from the GBM 
position reported in GCN 15228 (and 4.08 deg from SGR 1833-0832). So it 
is likely that the bright SGR-like burst 130913 originated from this 
SGR/AXP.
