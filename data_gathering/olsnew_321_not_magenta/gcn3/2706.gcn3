GRB team report:

An intense SGR-like burst was detected by Konus-Wind on September 10
at 35441.919 s (09:50:41.919) UT and
Helicon-Coronas-F at 35438.674 s (09:50.38.674) UT.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 325.353 deg, Decl(2000) = -13.289 deg,
whose radius is 51.241 +/- 0.156 deg (3 sigma).

This burst was also observed by Integral SPI-ACS.
The Konus-Wind - INTEGRAL triangulation annulus is:
RA(2000) = 322.942 deg,
Decl(2000) = -8.645 deg,
Radius = 50.227 +/- 0.328 degrees (3 sigma).

These annuli intersect to form two error boxes,
one of which may be eliminated by the Konus
ecliptic latitude response. The remaining error
box includes the position of SGR 1806-20,
so we believe that it is the source of this event.

Additionaly, two SGR-like bursts were detected recently by Konus-Wind.
The Konus ecliptic latitude response indicates
that the source of these bursts is near ecliptic plane, so we suppose,
that they are also originated from SGR 1806-20.


The following table summarizes the bursts
