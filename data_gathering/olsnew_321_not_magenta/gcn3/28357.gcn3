The long soft GRB 200903A (Swift detection: Beardmore et al.,
GCN Circ. 28350; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200903A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:44:17.477 UTC
on 3 September 2020 (http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1283129005/).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T+1.5 sec, peaks at T+5.9 sec, and ends at T+10.5 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 8.2 +- 0.8 sec
and 4.2 +- 0.8 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/ground/1283129005/

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
