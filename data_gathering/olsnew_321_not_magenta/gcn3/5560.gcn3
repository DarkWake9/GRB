on behalf of EAFON report:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060912 with the TNT 0.8m telescope at
Xinglong Observatory.The first image was taken at 13:57:23 UT, 89s
after the burst. The optical counterpart (Hurkett et al. GCN 5558)
were well detected in our clear and R band images.Preliminary analysis
shows the OT fade to ~19 about 35 minutes after the burst in our white
images. We encourage deeper observation.
Further analysis is under progress.

This message may be cited.

We apologize for the mistake about the character format.
