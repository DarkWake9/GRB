(Univ. of Auckland) report:

"Following the detection by SWIFT of the 
short/soft GRB 050202 (Tueller et al. GCN 
Circ. 3005) we imaged the error box with
the 0.6 m telescope at Mt. John University
Observatory. We obtained 3 x 300s images  
with the MOA camera (+ wide R-band filter) 
starting on 2.674 Feb (i.e. 12.6 hr after 
the event). Observations were performed 
at high airmass, prior to the sunrise. 
Comparison of the stacked image with the 
DSS-2 plates revealed no variable source 
to about R = 20."
