D.B. Fox (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:  

"We have imaged the optical afterglow candidate of Costa, Noel & Price
(GCN 2765) with the Robotic P60 on two occasions in the I-band, at
mean epochs 12:32:07 UT and 12:41:36 UT.  We can confirm that the
candidate is stationary, and faded by approximately 0.45 +/- 0.15 mag
in I over this interval by comparison to several nearby stars in the
field."
