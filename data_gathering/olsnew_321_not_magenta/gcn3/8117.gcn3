and G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:02:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080822B (trigger=321376).  Swift did not slew to this burst
because of the Moon observing constraint.  It will come out of Moon constraint
early 26 Aug 08 UT. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 63.495, +25.743, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 13m 59s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 44' 34"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT TDRSS light curve does not show anything
significant which is typical for an image trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. T. Holland (sholland AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)

[GCN OPS NOTE(22aug08): Per author's request, the missing "B" suffix on the
burst name was added.]
