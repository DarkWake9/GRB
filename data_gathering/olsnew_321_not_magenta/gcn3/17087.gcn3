We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 22.28 to 2014/11 22.53 UTC (26.79
to 32.94 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.93 hours
exposure in the r, i and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS
DR9, we
obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

 r 20.84 +/- 0.03
 i 20.68 +/- 0.03
 z > 20.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source has faded in r and i by 1.2 magnitudes or roughly t^-0.73 since
our observations on the first night (Watson et al., GCN 17084), confirming
that it is the afterglow. This fading is steeper than the t^-0.15 fading
seeing during our observations on the first night.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
