Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), and Atteia, J.L. (LAT-OMP) report:

We imaged the entire field of GRB 050525 detected by SWIFT (Band et al. GCNC 3466)
with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) located at the Calern observatory,
France. Observations started at 00:08:52s UT, 4 seconds after the GCN notice,
and 6 min after the GRB. The field had an elevation of 62 degrees
above horizon at the begining of the observations.

The afterglow reported by Rykoff et al. (GCNC 3465) is clearly seen
in TAROT images, with a magnitude R=15.1, 6 minutes after the GRB,
and R=17.1, 108 minutes after the GRB. The unfiltered TAROT images are
calibrated relative to R-band magnitudes in the USNO A1 Catalog.

Further information, including a light-curve of the afterglow
during the first two hours after the GRB can be found at the following address:
