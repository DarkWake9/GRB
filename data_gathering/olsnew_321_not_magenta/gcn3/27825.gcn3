N.P.M. Kuin (MSSL/UCL) and K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift UVOT team

Swift UVOT did a further follow up of the Fermi-LAT detected GRB200524A
(Dirirsa et al. GCN Circ. 27797). We detect the afterglow discovered
by Ho et al. (GCN Circ. 27799), ZTF20abbiixp, in the UVOT white filter
in 5.4ks exposure taken between To+1.15d and To+1.57d, with
 white = 22.06 +/- 0.12 magnitudes (on the UVOT photometric system,
Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373 ).  The source
does not vary significantly during these observations.
No correction has been made for the Galactic reddening E(B-V)=0.02
