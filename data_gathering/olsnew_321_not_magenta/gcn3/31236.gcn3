report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2021-12-11T13:09:59.500 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 211211A (trigger ID: HEB211211548) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team, GCN #31201),
Swift/BAT (D'Ai A. et al., GCN #31202),  
CALET (Tamura T. et al., GCN #31226) and
INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (Minaev P. et al., GCN #31230)

It should be noted that there is a significant saturation effect (data loss)
during bright parts of this GRB in HXMT. 

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
