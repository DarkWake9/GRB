Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130606A (trigger #557589)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 14781).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 249.390, 29.796 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 37m 33.6s
   Dec(J2000) = +29d 47' 44.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks. The first peak starts
around T-5 secs and last for 15 seconds, a cluster of weak peaks can be seen
from T+80 sec to T+110 sec, bright two peak structure is seen from T+150 sec
to T+ 170 sec, finally very weak extended multi-peak structure is observed
beyond
T+200 sec up to T+500 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 276.58 +- 19.31 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.34 to T+297 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.52 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.9 +- 0.2 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+160.36 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
