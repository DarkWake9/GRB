S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, H. Enos, and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

The short-duration GRB 180626B was detected by
Konus-Wind, Mars-Odyssey (HEND), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and Swift (BAT) at about 6441 s UT (01:47:21).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   214.555 (14h 18m 13s) +12.412 (+12d 24' 43")
  Corners:
   212.075 (14h 08m 18s)  +4.864 ( +4d 51' 52")
   213.948 (14h 15m 48s) +11.502 (+11d 30' 08")
   217.782 (14h 31m 08s) +21.164 (+21d 09' 51")
   215.173 (14h 20m 42s) +13.338 (+13d 20' 17")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 4.7 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 17.2 deg (the minimum one is 29 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 109 deg.

This box may be improved.

The localization of this burst is inconsistent with that of the short 
burst GRB 180626C, which is being reported in the next GCN Circular.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
