Christina C. Thoene (DARK Cosmology Centre), Christina Henriksen (DARK,
NOT) and Klaas Wiersema (Univ. of Amsterdam) report:

We observed the field of GRB060908 on Sep. 21 and 23 with ALFOSC at the
NOT on La Palma in V, R and i under variable conditions.
Near the position of the afterglow (GCN 5544), we detect a faint, extended
source in stacked images in V (7x600s) and R (10x600s), which we assume to
be the host galaxy of GRB060908. The possible host is not visible in
7x600s stacked images in the i band which might be due to severe fringing
in the i band images.
Photometry of the source gives values of V=24.9 +-0.1, R=25.12 +-0.05 and
i>24.6 +-0.2 using photometric zeropoints from the NOT/ALFOSC webpage.


An image of the host in the R-band can be found at
