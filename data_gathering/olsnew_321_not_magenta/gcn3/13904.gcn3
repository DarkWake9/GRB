S. B. Pandey and Brajesh Kuamr (ARIES Nainital India,
on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

We observed the GRB 121024A field (Pagani et al., GCN 13886) using
1.04m telescope at ARIES Nainital, starting ~16.9 hours after the
burst (19:49:49 UT, 2012-10-24). Several frames in R_c and I_c
pass-bands were acquired in high air-mass conditions.

In our co-added image (6x300 sec) of R_c band, the optical afterglow
candidate (Knust et al., GCN 13891) is clearly detected. The preliminary
photometry of the co-added frame (calibrated against nearby USNO stars)
estimates the magnitude of the optical afterglow to be 21.1 +- 0.1 mag.
