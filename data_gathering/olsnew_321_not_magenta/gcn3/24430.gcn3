S. B. Cenko (GSFC), S. Frederick (UMd), P. Gatkine (UMd), S. Dichiara (GSFC/UMd), E. Troja (GSFC/UMd), and L. P. Singer (GSFC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained a spectrum of the transient source ZTF19aassfws (Perley et al., GCN 24331) with the DeVeny spectrograph on the 4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope beginning at 10:07 UT on 2 May 2019.  The slit was centered on the nucleus of the host galaxy, SDSS J195440.25+611424.2.  The spectrum is dominated by a red stellar continuum, along with a series of nebular emission lines corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.093.  No clear evidence for broad emission lines or non-galaxy features are apparent.  For standard cosmological parameters, this corresponds to a luminosity distance of ~ 430 Mpc, consistent with the distance inferred from the gravitational wave emission (LVC et al., GCN 24237).
