report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140719B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 605700) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 85s after the GRB trigger
(33s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
46 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+85s to t0+145s : R > 16.5

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+163s to t0+193s : R > 18.5

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+163s to t0+446s : R > 19.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
