TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 101017A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    10/10/17 11:41:31 GMT
FROM:    Shashi Bhushan Pandey at ROTSE  <shaship@umich.edu>

S. B. Pandey (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded to
GRB 101017A (Swift trigger 436429; M. H. Siegel et al. GCN 11345),
producing images soon after the GCN notice time. We took 10 5-sec, 10
20-sec and 20 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated
relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or at the UVOT position, for both single
images and coadding into sets of 10. Individual images have limiting
magnitudes ranging from 15.6-16.4; we set the following specific limits.
