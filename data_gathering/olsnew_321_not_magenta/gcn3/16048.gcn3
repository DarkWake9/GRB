G. Vianello (Stanford U.), D. Kocevski (NASA/Goddard), and J. Racusin (NASA/Goddard) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 04:19:54.47 UT on March 30, 2014, Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 140330A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 417845997).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec 325.59, -64.30 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.2 deg (90% containment, statistical error only). This was within 15 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.  More than 10 photons above 100 MeV and 2 photons above 1 GeV are observed within 6000 seconds after the GBM trigger. The highest-energy photon is a 4.5 GeV event, which is observed 252 seconds after the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been requested and accepted for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Daniel Kocevski (daniel.kocevski@<mailto:xxxx@xxx.xxx>nasa.gov<http://nasa.gov>).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
