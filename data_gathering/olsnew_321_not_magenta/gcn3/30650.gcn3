C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 210730A (GCN 30559),
the reported position:

RA: 105.73 (+2.00, -1.85 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 14.79 (+0.91, -0.86 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately from 4.9 minutes
prior until 26.7 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations
are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
