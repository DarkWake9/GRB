"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 051227 (GCN 4397) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 18:27:18 UT on Dec.27.
After co-adding a set of 6 images (18:27:18 - 18:36:21 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than 17.6 mag."
