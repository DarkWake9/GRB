We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta,, et al., GCN 21106) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/05 20.16 to 2017/05 20.32 UTC (22.66 to
26.62 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.49 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.97 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections of the optical transient:

  r = 20.57 +/- 0.01
  i = 20.39 +/- 0.01
  Z = 20.05 +/- 0.04
  Y = 20.15 +/- 0.05
  J = 20.02 +/- 0.06
  H = 19.72 +/- 0.07

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Martir.
