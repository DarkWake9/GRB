The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 01:09:15 UT on 16 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200616A (trigger 613962560.630758 / 200616048).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 116.2, Dec = -72.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 44m, -72d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
