TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5531
SUBJECT: GRB 060906: Confirmation of P60 Optical Afterglow
DATE:    06/09/06 10:46:32 GMT
FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have continued to image the field of GRB060906 (Racusin et al; GCN
5528) with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Our observations
indicate the candidate identified by Cenko, Ofek and Fox (GCN 5529) has
faded and is therefore the optical afterglow of GRB060906.  In particular,
the object faded by ~ 0.9 mag in R-band images taken 11 min and 53 min
after the burst, corresponding to a shallow power-law decay index (t ^
-0.5).
