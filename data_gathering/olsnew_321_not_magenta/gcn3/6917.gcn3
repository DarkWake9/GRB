SUBJECT: GRB 071013: TLS Upper Limit

D. A. Kann, C. Hoegner & R. Filgas (TLS Tautenburg) report:

We observed the field of GRB 071013 (Marshall et al., GCN 6907) with the 
Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope under good conditions, obtaining 13 600 
second images in the Rc band. Within the revised BAT error circle (Palmer 
et al., GCN 6911), we find no new sources in comparison to the DSS. We 
note that our stacked image is much deeper than the DSS, and contains many 
additional faint sources. More precise analysis awaits the publication of 
a Swift XRT position.

Assuming the USNO B1.0 star at RA (J2000) = 18:38:05.67, Dec. (J2000) = 
+33:54:14.61 to have R2=17.22, we derive the following magnitude limit for 
regions not close to bright stars:

Date		Mid-Time	Rc limit (2 sigma)

13.79254	0.28608		23.0
