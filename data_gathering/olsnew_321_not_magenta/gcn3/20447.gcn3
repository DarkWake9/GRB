The AMI Large Array triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 161217A (D'Elia 
et al., GCN 20276) as part of the 4pisky program, and follow up 
observations were obtained up to 10 days post-burst. Our observations at 
15 GHz on 2016 Dec 23.16, Dec 24.15 and Dec 27.17 (UT) do not reveal any 
radio source at the XRT location (Osborne et al., GCN 20278), with 
3sigma upper limits of 84 uJy, 66 uJy and 77 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
