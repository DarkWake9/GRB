There are several very important arguments  for reality SSS17a as 
the kilonova  candidate  was published in LVC GCN. There are relativictic 
expansion  (see Nichol etal., LVC GCN 21585;) and big distance 
(delta ~ 3.9Mpc) 
between host galaxy explositions   ( D'Elia et al.,  LVC GCN 21592).

I point out that we can obtain minimal radial space velosity of the 
progenitor of the G298048:

      V_min = delta/T_Universe = 3.9 Mpc / 13.7 10^10 yrs  ~ 300 km/sec.

From other hand, because kick velosity realy is not more than 1000 km/s, 
we received typical age of the binary NS's as several billion years.

This is not contadict to Scenario Machine population synthesis of the 
NS+NS star merging rates evolution in Universe (Lipunov et al., 
1995, Evolution of  the Double Neutron Star Merging Rate and the 
Cosmological Origin of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources,1995,
Astrophysical Journal v.454, p.593; Lipunov & 
Pruzhinskaya; MNRAS, Vol. 440,  1193-1199, 2014.

From the other hand diference between NGC 4993 galaxy redshift and 
Kilonova ( D'Elia et al.,  LVC GCN 21592) may be explained by fast moving 
relativistic shell where some absobtion lines can be formed.
