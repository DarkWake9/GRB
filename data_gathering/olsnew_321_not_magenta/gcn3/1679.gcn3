K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 20395 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 25 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)=0.517, -35.271 degrees, whose radius is 47.726 +/-  0.026 
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.

It is not known at this point whether this event was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
