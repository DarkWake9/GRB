We observed the location of GRB 130131A (Grupe et al., GCN Circ. 14156) 
twice using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James 
Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The first observation started at 14:36 UT on 
2013-01-31, corresponding to 40 minutes after the burst trigger.  It 
lasted 2.0 hours in good weather conditions.  The second observation 
started at 12:40 UT on 2013-02-01, corresponding to 0.95 days after 
the burst trigger.  It lasted 2.1 hours in good weather conditions.  
No source was significantly detected in the individual or combined 
observations at the VLA location (Laskar et al., GCN Circ. 14171).  
The combined RMS was 2.2 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 18.2 mJy/beam at 
450 microns.

We thank Iain Coulson, Jim Hoge, Callie McNew, Alexander Karim, and 
William Montgomerie for their prompt support of these observations.
