report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:08:40.90 UT on 24 June 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140624A (trigger 425297323/140624423).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 23.16, DEC = -0.56 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 01h 32m, -00d 33'), with an uncertainty
of 4.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight, using the GBM on-ground
calculated location, is 54 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration of about 0.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.064 s is
adequately fit by a Comptonized function with Epeak = 365 +/- 81 keV,
and alpha = -0.8 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.0 +/- 0.3)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064 second peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+0.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 19.2 +/- 1.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
