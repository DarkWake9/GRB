report:

Following the detection of GRB 030115 by HETE, we have
obtained BVRI images at the 1.5-m telescope at IAA's
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada in Granada, starting on Jan
15.220 UT. An optical source with R about 18 which is not
in the DDS-2 (R) is seen at coordinates RA (2000) =
11 18 23.8 Dec (2000) = + 15 05 10 (preliminary). Further
observations are urged in order to confirm whether this is
the optical counterpart of GRB 030115. An ID chart will be
posted at: http://www.iaa.csic.es/~ajct/GRBs/grb030115/
