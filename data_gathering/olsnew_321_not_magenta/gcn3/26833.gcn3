C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 200120A (GCN 26832),
the reported position:

RA:  67.46 (+0.36 -0.43  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -14.63  (+0.32 -0.25  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 11.7 minutes
prior until 22.2 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations
are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
