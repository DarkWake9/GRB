We report the spectroscopic follow-up observations on ATLAS17aeu (Tonry et
al. LVC GCN #20382) and iPTF17cw (Kasliwal et al. LVC GCN #20398) using the
Double Beam spectrograph (DBSP) on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. The
position of both targets are within the probability contour of LIGO/Virgo
G268556 (LVC, GCN #20364).  All observations were obtained on 2017 Jan 7 UT
under poor weather conditions with a partly cloudy sky. Classifications
were performed using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190).

ATLAS17aeu was observed on 2017-01-07.5 UT with a total exposure time of 60
min resulting in a signal to noise ratio ~1.5 in the continuum. No obvious
emission or absorption lines are detected in the spectrum. To search for
features from a Galactic source at z=0, we set a 3-sigma flux limit around
6563 Angstrom of 3.3e-17 ergs/s/cm^2/A. This result is consistent with
Chambers et al. (LVC GCN #20407) who reported a featureless spectrum of
ATLAS17aeu obtained with Gemini.

iPTF17cw was observed on 2017-01-07.55 with a total exposure time of 20 min
which results in a signal to noise ratio ~11 in the continuum. The spectrum
shows a blue continuum peaking around 3850 Angstroem (rest frame) with
weak, broad features. We found a good match of the spectrum with the
SNIc-BL SN1998bw pre-maximum at z=0.093. The redshift is consistent with
the photoz=0.101Â±0.0279 derived by SDSS for the host Galaxy.
