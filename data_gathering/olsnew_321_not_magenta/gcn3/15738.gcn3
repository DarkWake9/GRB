Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140114A (trigger #583861)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 15728).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 188.498, 27.942 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 33m 59.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +27d 56' 31.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows one roughly symmetrical peak starting 
at ~T+10 sec, peaking at ~T+100 sec, and ending at ~T+210 sec. There are a few
small peaks riding on top of the main peak.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 139.7 +- 16.4 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+24.2 to T+202.5 sec (with 2.7 sec missing 
in the middle due to data drop outs) is best fit by a simple power-law model.
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.06 +- 0.09.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+115.88 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
