A. Corsi (Texas Tech) and A. Horesh (Weizmann Inst.) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of PTF14eag (the optical afterglow candidate of
GRB 140808A; Singer et al., GCN 16668) with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA) in K-band, starting at about 2.1 days after the Fermi 
trigger 429152043 / 140808038 (Zhang, GCN 16669). A provisional
reduction shows a source consistent with the location of PTF14eag. 
At this time, we estimate a preliminary flux of about  130 uJy at 22 GHz.
The image rms is about 19 uJy. 

Further observations are planned.
