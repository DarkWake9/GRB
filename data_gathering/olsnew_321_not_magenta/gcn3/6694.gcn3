report:

The 7-channel imager GROND at the 2.2 m telescope of the La Silla Observatory 
(ESO/Chile) is observing the field of GRB 070802 (Swift trigger 286809, 
Barthelmy et al. 2007, GCN #6692). The observation started on August 2 at 
07:17 UT, about 10 min after the GRB trigger. Observations are still ongoing. 
The observation consists of a series of exposures in g', r', i, z', Js, H and 
Ks. The automated data reduction pipeline finds an elongated source in the 
XRT error circle. This source has a magnitude of about Js = 20. This is the 
result of our first four minutes exposure.
