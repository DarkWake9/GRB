Pulse Frequency of SGR 1806-20 during the Giant Flare

P.M. Woods, M. Finger, S. Patel (USRA, NSSTC), C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC,

C. Markwardt (GSFC) report:

We have re-analyzed the RXTE PCA data of the giant flare of 2004 December 27
from SGR 1806-20.  We find that the pulse period reported in GCN #2927 of 7.579
+/- 0.002 s was strongly biased by pulse profile changes during the tail of
this flare.  Excluding the first ~60 s of the flare where pulse profile changes
are strongest, we measure a barycenter-corrected pulse period of 7.5605 +/-
0.0006 s, significantly different than the previously reported measurement.
