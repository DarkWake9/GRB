A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), D. M. Palmer (LANL)
and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 04:19:22 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 181123A (trigger=873178).  Swift could not slew to the
burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 284.651, -8.237 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 58m 36s
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 14' 13"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, there is
no obvious variation in the immediately-available BAT lightcurve. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not be able to slew
to the burst until February 19. There will therefore be no XRT or
UVOT data on this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
