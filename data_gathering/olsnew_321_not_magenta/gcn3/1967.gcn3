E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-GRS, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) and Konus-Wind  observed
this GRB at 38621 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately 10 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
3.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  8.2E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 200 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:


    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  19 h 31 m 51.62 s    -11 o 43 '  12.77 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 19 h 32 m 19.63 s    -11 o 34 '   7.79 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 19 h 29 m 34.77 s    -12 o 14 '  36.98 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 19 h 34 m  2.77 s    -11 o 13 '  42.27 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 19 h 31 m 23.30 s    -11 o 52 '  24.45 " 

This error box may be improved.
