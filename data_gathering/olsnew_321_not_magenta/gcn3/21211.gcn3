The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170519A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 May 19.61, May 20.84, May 
23.74 and May 27.78 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 21107), with 3sigma upper limits of 228 
uJy, 190 uJy, 150 uJy, and 100 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
