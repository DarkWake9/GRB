Swift Team:

At 17:25:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090715 (trigger=357498). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 152.122, +9.997 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 08m 29s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 59' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 0.4 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~11,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to current problems with the Solid State Recorder (GCN 9664),
automatic slewing to sources is disabled.  However, this burst
location is also in Sun constraint and will not come out of 
constraint until October 9, 2009.  There will thus be no XRT or 
UVOT data for this trigger. 

We note the existence of an S0/A galaxy NGC 3130 (z=0.027) near
the edge of the BAT error circle (nominal position of
the galaxy is 4.33 arcminutes from the center of the
error circle, with NED reporting a radius of 1.0 arcmin
for the galaxy). 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (racusin AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
