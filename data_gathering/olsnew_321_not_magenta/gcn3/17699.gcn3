on behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

A bright, short-duration, soft burst has been observed by Konus-Wind, 
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Mars-Odyssey (HEND), so far, at about 41064 s UT 
(11:24:24) on April 12.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   293.489 (19h 33m 57s) +22.543 (+22d 32' 35")
  Corners:
   293.060 (19h 32m 14s) +23.547 (+23d 32' 50")
   293.029 (19h 32m 07s) +24.004 (+24d 00' 14")
   293.918 (19h 35m 40s) +21.515 (+21d 30' 54")
   293.951 (19h 35m 48s) +21.033 (+21d 02' 00")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1118 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 3 deg (the minimum one is 7 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 84 deg.

This box may be improved.

The position of SGR 1935+2154 (Stamatikos et., al. GCN Circ. 16520; Lien 
et al., GCN Circ. 16522; Cummmings et al., ATel #6294) is inside the box 
at 41 arcmin from its center (at 0.8 arcmin from the center line of the 
7 arcmin wide Konus-HEND annulus).

Given the positional coincidence of this burst with SGR 1935+2154 and 
softness of its spectrum (as observed by Konus-Wind), we conclude this 
burst is likely originated from SGR 1935+2154.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming 
GCN Circular.
