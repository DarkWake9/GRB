Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

We have detected GRB 130418A optical afterglow at iTelescope observatories
T18 and T21. Four unfiltered and three photometric V filter images with 300 sec exposure time were made at T18 (AstroCamp Observatory, Nerpio, Spain) 0.32-m/8.0 Astorgraph and KAF-6303E CCD. Two unfiltered and four photometric V filter images with 600 sec exposure time were made at T21 (Mayhill, New Mexico) 0.43-m/6.8 astrograph and FLI ProLine PL6303E CCD.

The afterglow was detected at following position RA 09:56:08.94 and DEC +13:40:02.9.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using 
NOMAD1 1036-0179295 (V= 14.750, R = 14.910) as the comparison:
