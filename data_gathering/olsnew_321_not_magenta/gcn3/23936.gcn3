and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The very bright, long-duration GRB 190305A was detected by
AGILE (MCAL; Ursi et al., GCN Circ. 23930),
MAXI (GSC; Nakahira et al., GCN Circ. 23933),
CALET (GBM trigger 1235826131), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Swift (BAT), and Insight (HXMT/HE; Xiao et al., GCN Circ. 23934)
at about 47118 s UT (13:05:18).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a Konus-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=340.399 deg (22h 41m 36s) Dec(2000)=-10.588 deg (-10d 35' 17"), 
whose radius is 47.461 +/- 0.110 deg (3 sigma), and
to a Konus-BAT annulus centered at
RA(2000)=337.304 deg (22h 29m 13s) Dec(2000)=-7.381 deg (-7d 22' 51"), 
whose radius is 51.552 +/- 0.132 deg (3 sigma).

The position of the XRT source #1 (D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 23935)
lies 0.019 deg from the center line of the Konus-BAT annulus
and 0.136 deg from the center line of the Konus-INTEGRAL annulus,
supporting the conclusion that this source is the GRB counterpart.

This localization may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming 
GCN Circular.
