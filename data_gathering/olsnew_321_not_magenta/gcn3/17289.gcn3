S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report:

We observed the field of the transient Swift J123205.1-105602 (Cummings;
GCN 17267) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory beginning on
2015 Jan 09.48 UT (7.83 days post-burst) for a total exposure of 14.9 ks.
At the transient position we detect two X-ray sources within the Swift/XRT
point spread function:

SRCX #1
The first source is located at:

RA(J2000) = 12:32:04.985
Dec(J2000) = -10:56:00.21

with a 90% uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec. This position is consistent with the
XRT position (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/00020464/), the bright
radio source reported by van der Horst et al. (GCN 17286), and the nucleus
of 2MASX J12320498-1056010.
The source is well described by an absorbed power-law with photon index
Gamma=2.3 ± 0.2, and absorption column consistent with the Galactic value
of 3E20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The observed flux in the 0.5-8.0 keV
energy band is (4.0 ± 0.4)E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

SRCX #2
The second, fainter source is located at:

RA(J2000) = 12:32:05.104
Dec(J2000) = -10:56:02.78

with a 90% uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec. This position is consistent with the
optical source reported by Fong et al. (GCN 17271).
The source is well described by an absorbed power-law with photon index
Gamma=1.8 ± 0.3, and absorption column consistent with the Galactic value
of 3E20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). The observed flux in the 0.5-8.0 keV
energy band is (1.2 ± 0.2)E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

Both sources do not display significant temporal variability during our
observation.

We do not detect any X-ray counterpart at the position of the second radio
source reported by van der Horst et al. (GCN 17286) down to  a limit of
3E-4 cts s^-1 (95% confidence level).


We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire Chandra staff for approving and
rapidly executing this observation.
