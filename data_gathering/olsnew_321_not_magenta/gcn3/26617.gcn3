report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-12-27T17:21:44.14 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 191227B (trigger ID: HEB191227723) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM, IPN and Konus-Wind (GCN #26612).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 0.161 s measured from T0+0.010 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.045 s, is 50,544 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 4123 counts. But it should be
noted that the Insight-HXMT/HE detection suffers from saturation 
when the count rate exceeds ~20,000 cnts/sec. The uncorrected 
light curve can be found at:

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
