TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14398
SUBJECT: GRB 130327B: Swift/XRT source is not the afterglow

H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and E. Troja (NASA/GSFC/CRESST) for the Swift team:

Swift carried out an additional 4.6 ksec observation of the field containing GRB 
130327B (e.g. Longo et al, GCN 14344; Ohno et al, GCN 14347), starting at 
2013-04-18 12:43:13 UT, approximately 22 days after the burst.  The source 
reported in Krimm & Mangano (GCN 14353) as a possible afterglow to GRB 130327B 
is still detected at a rate of 0.002 ± 0.001 cts/s (0.3-10 keV), which is 
statistically consistent with the rate reported in GCN 14353.  Since we would 
expect a GRB afterglow to have faded over this time period, we conclude that the 
XRT source is not associated with GRB 130327B, and is instead a background 
source, possibly an AGN.
	No further Swift observations are planned.
