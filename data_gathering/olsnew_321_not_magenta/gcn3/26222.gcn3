SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S191110af: Identification of a GW unmodeled transient candidate
DATE:    19/11/11 00:15:09 GMT
FROM:    Deep Chatterjee at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee  <deep@uwm.edu>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:


We identified the unmodeled transient candidate S191110af during real-
time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-11-10
23:06:44.183 UTC (GPS time: 1257462422.183). The candidate was found
by the CWB [1] analysis pipeline.

S191110af is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 2.5e-09 Hz, or about one in 12
years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

One sky map is available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * cWB.fits.gz,1 an initial localization generated by CWB [1],
    distributed via GCN notice about 10 minutes after the
    candidate event time.
