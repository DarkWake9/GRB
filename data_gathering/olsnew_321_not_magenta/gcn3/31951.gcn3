The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:10:36 UT on 26 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220426B (trigger 672649841.18156 / 220426299).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 138.4, Dec = -13.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 13m, -13d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 55.0 degrees.
