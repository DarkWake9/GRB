J. Norris, A. Kutyrev (NASA/GSFC), R. Ganguly, R. Canterna,
and M. Pierce (U. Wyoming) report:

We observed the refined XRT error circle reported by Page et al. (GCN 4745)
for GRB 060211a (Swift trigger #181156; Mateos et al., GCN 4739; Tueller
et al., GCN 4747) with the 2.3-meter WIRO telescope.

Observations commenced at 2006/02/12 03:35 UT (11.7 hrs after the burst)
and continued until 04:15 UT.  We obtained twenty 100-s integrations of
the target region in the J band under poor seeing conditions.  In the
stacked image, no source was detected within or near the XRT error circle
to a limit of J = 19.2  (3-sigma upper limit).
