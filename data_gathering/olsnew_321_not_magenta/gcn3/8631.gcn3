D. A. Perley and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

We triggered Gemini-N (GMOS) observations of BATSS GRB 081203B (Copete 
et al., GCN 8600, 8602) starting at 15:04 UT 2008-12-06 through very 
high airmass but under good conditions.  In our acquisition image we 
identify a source at the position of the optical afterglow (Schady et 
al., GCN 8606).  Photometry, calibrated to SDSS, is:

r = 21.90 +/- 0.06   (t = 3.05 days)

Two spectroscopic integrations of 1200s each were acquired using the 
R150 grating.  Preliminary inspection of the frames reveals no obvious 
line features between 5200-9000 A.  Further analysis is continuing.
