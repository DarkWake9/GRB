GRB 991216: Comparison with DPOSS N-plate image

A. Diercks, S. G. Djorgovski, J. S. Bloom, A. Mahabal, and R. R. Gal
(Caltech) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"The source by Garnavich et al. (GCN #469) is well detected in the
N-band DPOSS survey plate (IVN + RG9) and thus unlikely to be related
to GRB 991216.  Unfortunately, the photometric calibration of this
plate is not available at present. However, based on an average
zero-point, we estimate the brightness of this source to be
approximately I ~ 18.5 +/- 0.5.  The source is not detected in either
the F (red) or J (blue) plates."
