RAS), E. Klunko (ISTP), V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), I. Korobtsev (ISTP),   V. 
Ayvazian  (AbAO),  O. Kvaratskhelia  (AbAO), G. Inasaridze (AbAO),  I. 
Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko (IKI)    report on behalf of  larger GRB 
follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161219B (Swift trigger 727541; D'Ai,GCN 20296) 
with AZT-33IK (Mondy), ZTSh (CrAO), AS-32 (AbAO) and Zeiss-1000 (SAO RAS) 
telescopes.  We obtained  unfiltered images (AbAO) and images in R-filter 
(other observatories). The optical source associated with the afterglow 
(D'Ai et al., GCN 20296; Kruehler et al., GCN 20299; Guidorzi et al., GCN 
20300; Martin-Carrillo et al., GCN 20305) and SN2016jca  (de Ugarte Postigo 
et al., GCN 20342; Chen et al., GCN 20380) is clearly visible in all our 
observations.

Preliminary light curve of the afterglow and  SN2016jca  can be found at
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB161219B/GRB161219B_LC.png
Photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars (R2) common for all images. 
Late time photometry is contaminated by  Pan-STARRS galaxy previously 
reported by Kruehler et al. (GCN 20299), and  also presented in USNO-B1.0. 
Apparent maximum brightness of the SN2016jca was observed at about 11 days 
after burst onset (R = 19.2 at 2016-12-30 (UT) 20:04:59) and actual SN peak 
could be slighter later,  between 11 and 14 days after burst.
