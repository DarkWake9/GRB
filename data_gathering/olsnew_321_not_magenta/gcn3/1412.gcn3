the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

The initial triangulation of this burst, given in GCN 1409, was based
on the data of the only three spacecraft available at that time, and
therefore gave two alternate positions, one of which appeared to be
ruled out based on its ecliptic latitude.  However, this burst was also
observed by RHESSI.  The addition of this fourth spacecraft to the
triangulation indicates that the burst in fact must have originated
from the alternate error box.  The area of this error box is
approximately 19 square arcminutes and its coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 15 h 46 m 35.53 s    -22 o 15 '  12.95 "  (CENTER)
 15 h 46 m  2.21 s    -22 o 18 '  52.67 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 46 m 22.37 s    -22 o 18 '   4.94 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 46 m 48.71 s    -22 o 12 '  20.76 "  (CORNER)
 15 h 47 m  8.96 s    -22 o 11 '  32.14 "  (CORNER)

The other properties of the burst given in GCN 1409 have not
changed.

We regret the inconvenience which this error may have caused.
