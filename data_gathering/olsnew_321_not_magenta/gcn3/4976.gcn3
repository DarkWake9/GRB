report:

The robotic telescope FRAM (part of the Pierre Auger
Observatory) located in Malargue, Argentina, observed the
Swift GRB 060418 (Falcone et al., GCN 4966) in fully automatic
mode (under control of RTS2), starting 51s after the GRB
trigger under thin cirrus. We detect the OT reported by UVOT
at 5 combined images (220s integration time) with mean
exposure time 3:11:12UT (~300s after the trigger) with R-band
magnitude 14.2+-0.2. We note, that our lightcurve seems to
peak at about this time - in agreement with observation of
PROMPT (Nysewander et al., GCN 4971).
