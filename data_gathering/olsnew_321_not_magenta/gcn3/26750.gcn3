Michael J. Lundquist, David J. Sand (UA), Kerry Paterson, Wen-fai Fong,

Eric Christensen, Alex Gibbs, Frank Shelly, report on behalf of the SAGUARO
collaboration:

Following Andreoni et al. (GCN 26741), we report a previous SAGUARO
(Lundquist et al. 2019) detection at the position of the candidate
ZTF20aafeaqk (AT2020vx), from 2019 Nov 24.  The object was detected in a
stack of 4 images at the location of the transient (RA = 7:08:43.698, Dec
=14:38:15.336).

MJD | AB Magnitude | Error

58811.4420504 | 20.86 | 0.17

This detection was in data taken with the 1.5m Catalina Sky Survey (CSS)
telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ during routine operations, calibrated to Gaia G.

We believe ZTF20aafeaqk (AT2020vx) to be unrelated to the LIGO/Virgo event
S200114f.
