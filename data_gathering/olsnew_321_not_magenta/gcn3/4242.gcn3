TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4242
SUBJECT: GRB 051105a: GETS optical limit

FROM:    Kenzo Kinugasa at Gunma Astro. Obs/Japan  <kinugasa@astron.pref.gunma.jp>

K. Kinugasa (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) and K. Torii (Osaka U.) report:

 The error region of the short GRB 051105a (Mineo, et al. GCN 4188)
was imaged by the robotic 0.25m GETS telescope in the Gunma
Astronomical Observatory.  Unfiltered imaging started at 09:25:04 UT
(3.0 hours after the trigger) and 30 s integration was repeated.

 We do not identify a new object within the BAT error region (GCN 4188)
and the following upper limits are derived relative to USNO-A1.0 R mag.
