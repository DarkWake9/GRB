V. D Elia (SSDC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed a second follow-up observation of the AGILE-, GBM- and LAT-detected burst GRB 181225A (Ursi et al., GCN Circ. 23560; Arimoto et al. GCN Circ., 23561; Poolakkil et al., GCN Circ. 23562). The XRT total exposure time is 7 ks. The data were collected 5.6 days after the trigger, and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

The two sources detected in the first XRT observation (Dâ€™Elia et al., GCN Circ 23565) are still present in the XRT field of view of the new observation, with consistent rates and positions. We thus conclude that they are unrelated to the X-ray afterglow of GRB181225A. 

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
