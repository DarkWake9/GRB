The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170115A (Page et al., GCN 20462) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jan 16.42, Jan 17.59, Jan 
18.67 and Jan 23.51 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Osborne et al., GCN 20465), with 3sigma upper limits of 300 
uJy, 78 uJy, 72 uJy and 81 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
