and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB160223B (Gotz et al., GCN Circ. 19059; von Kienlin et al., GCN Circ. 19061) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 09:58:59.5 on 23 February 2016.  
The burst signal was detected by SGM instrument.  

The light curve of the SGM shows at least three peaks.  The emission starts at T0, 
peaks at T0+1 sec and ends at T0+25 sec.   The T90 duration measured by the SGM data 
is 11 +- 1 sec (40-1000 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
