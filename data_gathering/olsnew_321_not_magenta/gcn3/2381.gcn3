K. Torii (RIKEN) reports:

 "A part of the WXM error region of GRB 030913 (HETE trigger 2849) was
observed by the Automated Response Telescope at RIKEN (0.25-m f/6.8
reflector equipped with unfiltered CCD AP6E). The observation started
at 2003 September 13, 17:08:24 UT (87 s after trigger), and 40 s
integration was repeated.

 In a stacked frame (12 x 40 s), no new object brighter than about
14.5 mag (USNO A2.0 red) is identified within the central 30x30
arcminutes area of the WXM position (Seq_Num 2). Further analysis is
in progress."
