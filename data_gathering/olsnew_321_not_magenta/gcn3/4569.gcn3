Dale A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the Swift burst GRB060116
(GCN 4519; GCN 4531) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2006 January 21 and
23. At the position of the IR afterglow (GCN 4540; GCN 4545)
we detect a weak radio source.

Further observations are planned to monitor the source and to obtain
an accurate flux calibration.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
