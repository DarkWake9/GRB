M. Andreev (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy) V. Petkov, A. Kurenya 
(BNO INR RAS), A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up 
collaboration  report:

We observed the GRB080211 (Hurley et al. GCN 7295, Golenetskii et al. GCN 
7309) with Zeiss-600 of Mt.Terskol observatory on Feb. 12 between (UT) 
17:10-17:21 in R-filter under poor weather conditions. Our observation 
covered  central part of the IPN error-box. Within IPN error-box (Hurley et 
al. GCN 7295), we found one source not presented in any DSS2 plates. 
Coordinates of the source are RA(J2000) = 02h55m50.9s,  Dec.(J2000) = +60 
05' 43.6". Photometry against of USNO-B1.0 is following

T0+  ,        Exposure,   R_mag
(mid time)

1.41d        10x30 s      17.3

Further examination of XRT and UVOT observation (Beardmore et al. GCN 7312) 
and additional observations are necessary to confirm the nature of the found 
source.
