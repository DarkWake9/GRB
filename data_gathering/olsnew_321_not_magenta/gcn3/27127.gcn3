The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:54:14 UT on 19 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200219B (trigger 603798859.677708 / 200219413).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 299.1, Dec = 6.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 56m, 6d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 46.0 degrees.
