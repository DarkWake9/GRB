The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 07:36:49 UT on 19 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200219A (trigger 603790614.095852 / 200219317).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 344.1, Dec = -60.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 56m, -60d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
