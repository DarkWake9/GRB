collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140301A (Page et al., GCN 15896) with the
Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with the MOSCA imager. Observations
were taken at high airmass, in twilight, using the R and z filters.

Consistent with the position of the XRT afterglow (Goad et al.,
GCN 15898), our images show the presence of a faint object in the
R band, with coordinates:

RA = 04:38:13.78
Dec = -34:15:23.5

and uncertainties of approximately 0.5" in each coordinate.

At a midtime of 4.97 hr after the trigger, we measure a brightness
of R = 23.1 +/- 0.3 mag. This magnitude is calibrated against stars
from the USNO-B1 catalog.

No statement about fading can be made at this point.
