report on behalf of a larger team:

We have triggered our accepted Chandra Guest Investigation on dark Gamma
Ray Bursts for GRB051022.  A CXO observation of 20 ks will commence today
at 21:44:42 UT.  We plan to analyze the data by the end of the day and
send out a first source location with at least an aspect solution
uncertainty (0.7").  A more accurate location using astrometry will be
reported as soon as the complete data set is available.  We urge follow
up observations of the source in radio and IR.
