report on behalf of GRB IKI FuN collaboration:

We continued observations of the field of XRT #2 sources (D'Elia et al.,
GCN 29202) (hereafter X2) found in IPN localization area (Svinkin et
al., GCN 29182) of GRB 201227A (Ursi et al., GCN 29179; Xiao et al., GCN
29187; Svinkin et al., GCN 29196; Lesage et al., GCN 29206; Marisaldi et 
al., GCN 29276) with Chilescope RC-1000 on 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-08 in 
r'-filter.

The X2_O2 object found in previous observation on 2020-12-29 at r'(AB)=
20.5 (Belkin et al., GCN 29208; see also Izzo et al., GCN 29207) is not
detected on 2021-01-01 with an upper limit of r'(AB) > 20.6 and barely
detected on 2021-01-08 at r'(AB)=22.6. Now we confirm the variability of
the object of X2_O2 and suggest the optical object X2_02 could be a
counterpart of GRB 201227A. In the last image on 2021-01-08, the object 
X2_O2 could be the host galaxy. A finding chart of the X2_O2 can be found in

Preliminary photometry of the X2_O2 is following

The photometry is based on nearby stars from the APASS_DR8

11:19:36.65304 -73:36:30.2112 15.307

In addition we investigated a position of the GRB 201227A on the EHD 
diagram (see Minaev et al., MNRAS, 492,  1919, 2020). The position of 
GRB 201227A based on Konus-Wind data (Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 29196) 
can be found in

We can exclude the GRB 201227A as a giant flare event of SGR since there 
is no nearby galaxies in the IPN error box. We can identify the GRB 
201227A as short GRB at a redshift of z > 0.05.
