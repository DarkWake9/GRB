We observed the field of GRB 120202A (Mereghetti et al., GCN 12909) with 
0.5m robotic telescope D50 in Ondrejov observatory (Czech Republic). The 
observation started at 23:45:46 UT on February 02, 2012, approx. 2 hours 
after the INTEGRAL trigger. We report no detection of the optical 
counterpart on the unfiltered images within the error circle given by 
SWIFT/XRT (Holland et al., GCN 12911). The upper limit of 20.5 mag in R 
band was estiated using nearby sources from GSC2.2 catalogue.

This research was made on behalf of larger cooperation and used RTS2 
system.
