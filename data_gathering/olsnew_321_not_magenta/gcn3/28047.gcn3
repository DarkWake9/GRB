B. Sbarufatti (PSU), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and K. K. Simpson (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team.

Swift performed a second observation of the field of GRB 200623A, with a 4.5 ks exposure.

The only uncatalogued source in the field, Source 3 (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 28023), is still detected and shows no evidence of fading, so we conclude that it is not the GRB afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
