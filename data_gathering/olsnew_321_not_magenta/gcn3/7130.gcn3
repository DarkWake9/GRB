L. A. Antonelli (INAF-OAR), E. Maiorano (INAF-IASF Bo), M. Pedani, L. 
Di Fabrizio, S. Marinoni (TNG) report on behalf the CIBO collaboration:

"We observed the field of the GRB 071104 detected by SuperAGILE 
(Donnarumma et al., GCN 7042) with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo 
(TNG) [La Palma (Canary Islands)] equipped with NICS in the J and H 
bands. The observations were performed on 2 different epochs, Nov. 04 
and Nov 09 2007, just after the twilight in good seeing condition 
(<0.9").

First epoch observation started Nov 04 at 19:28 UT (about 7.8 hrs after 
the burst) and filters were  exposed for a total time of about 1200 s 
each. Two sources are clearly detected  within the XRT error circle 
(Page, GCN 7043) in both filters:

	Source	RA(J2000)	Dec.(J2000)    Jmag
	   S1         19:42:26.72	+14:36:36.9    18.8+/-0.2
	   S2	        19:42:26.82	+14:36:37.2    20.5+/-0.5

Calibrated against the 2MASS.

Second epoch observation started on Nov. 09 at 19:00 UT and the same 
filters were exposed for the same time under better seeing condition. 
The source S1 is still well detected at the same mag. On the contrary, 
source S2 is not detected down to a limiting magnitude of J > 21.7 (3 
sigma) strongly suggesting that this is the afterglow of GRB 071104.
