SUBJECT: GRB 160310A: Further NOT observations

T. Kruehler (MPE Garching), G. Leloudas (Weizmann Institute, DARK/NBI),
D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), and T. Kuutma (NOT) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We again observed the field of GRB 160310A (Vianello et al., GCN #19158,
Toelge & Hui, GCN #19161) with the NOT equipped with ALFOSC.
A second epoch of imaging in the I-band filter was obtained starting at
20:21:05 UT on 2016-03-11, 48.0 hr after the GRB trigger.

In a combined image of 5x120 s exposure time, we still detect
the same source in the XRT error circle at a brightness comparable to
the observations 24 hours earlier (Kruehler et al., GCN #19164, see
also Troja et al., GCN #19166), indicating that it is likely not the
optical afterglow of GRB 160310A.
