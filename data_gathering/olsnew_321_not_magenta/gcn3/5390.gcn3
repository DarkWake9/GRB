TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5390
SUBJECT: GRB 060801: WSRT Radio Observations
DATE:    06/08/03 01:29:48 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <avdhorst@science.uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 060801 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope on Aug 2 from 11.03 to 23.01 UT, i.e.
0.95 - 1.45 days after the burst (GCN 5378).
We do not detect a radio source within the XRT error circle (GCN 5382) or
the refined XRT/SDSS error circle (GCN 5389), in particular at the
position of the optical sources mentioned in GCN 5384 and GCN 5386.
The rms noise in het map within the SWIFT/XRT error circle is 24 microJy
per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at the center of
the XRT error circle is 32 +/- 24 microJy.

We detect two sources close to the XRT error circle which are also present
in the FIRST survey at 1.4 GHz. These sources have fluxes of 854 +/- 37
microJy (RA(J2000)=14h12m00.39s, Dec(J2000)=16d59m05.3s) and 1031 +/- 37
microJy (RA(J2000)=14h12m01.18s, Dec(J2000)=16d59m06.7s) at 4.9 Ghz."
