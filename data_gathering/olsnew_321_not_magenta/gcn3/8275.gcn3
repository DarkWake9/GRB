Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080919 (trigger #325268)
(Preger, et al., GCN Circ. 8270).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 265.221, -42.375 deg which is
 RA(J2000)  =  17h 40m 53.0s
 Dec(J2000) = -42d 22' 29.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 99%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad peak of approximately 750 msec
duration starting at T+0 followed immediately by a weaker ~400 msec
peak seen mostly below 50 keV. T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.6 +- 0.1 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.1 to T+0.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.10 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.2 +- 1.1 x 10-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% 
confidence level.
