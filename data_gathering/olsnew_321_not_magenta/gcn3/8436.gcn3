E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 081029 (Swift trigger 332931, GCN 8435, Sakamoto et 
al.). The first image was at 01:45:22.8 UT, 86.0 s after the burst (8.8 
s after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images are calibrated 
relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 16.5 magnitude, fading source with 
coordinates:

      23:07:05.36      -68:09:19.74    (J2000), with positional 
uncertainty of 1" or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker 
database.

A jpeg image is available at 
http://www.rotse.net/images/gsb332931_3c011-020_key.jpg Note that the 
object marked 36 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
