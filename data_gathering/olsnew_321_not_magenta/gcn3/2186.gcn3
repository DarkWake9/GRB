K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, 

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,report:

Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 04637
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 8
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  3.5E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  7.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 332.708, -37.556 degrees, whose radius is 76.840 +/-  0.037
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
