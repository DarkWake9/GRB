SUBJECT: GRB 131024B: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

M. M. Chester (PSU) and H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 131024B
121 s after the BAT trigger (Krimm et al., GCN Circ. 15371).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position (Beardmore et 
al. GCN Circ. 15374) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the second 
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are given in 
the following table.  (The first finding chart in White was 
incomplete and is not included in the analysis.)

w2                 585         5785          413         >21.3

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
