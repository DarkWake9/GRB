K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, reports:

The confidence region for one dimension of the error box
of this burst (GCN 2221) was underestimated.  The correct,
3 sigma error box coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  5 h 26 m 24.19 s      7 o  8 '  47.66 "  (CENTER)
  5 h 39 m  9.75 s      2 o 55 '   0.26 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 39 m 12.94 s      2 o 56 '  49.85 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 12 m 55.57 s     11 o 46 '  51.06 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 12 m 57.81 s     11 o 49 '   7.90 "  (CORNER)

The area of this error box is approximately 1100 square arcminutes.

I regret any inconvenience caused by this mistake.
