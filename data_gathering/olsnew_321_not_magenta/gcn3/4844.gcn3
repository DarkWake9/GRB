M. Andreev (Institute of Astronomy), A. Pozanenko  (IKI)  on behalf of
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB060223b (Cummings et al. GCN 4821)  in V-band
with the 60 cm telescope of  peak Terskol observatory on Feb. 24 between
(UT) 02:24-02:41.   No new source is detected in comparison of combined
image (18x60 s)  with DSS2(R) at the refined XRT position (Perri et al. GCN
4835) and in a larger refined BAT position (Fenimore et al. GCN 4825).


The limiting magnitude is determined in comparison with USNO A2.0 (R):

Mid  time,      exp.,  mag.(UL)
(UT)            (s)
