The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:35:39 UT on 6 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220606A (trigger 676168544.281518 / 220606025).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 258.2, Dec = -26.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 12m, -26d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 94.0 degrees.
