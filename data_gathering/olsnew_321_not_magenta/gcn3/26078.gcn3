The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:19:07 UT on 27 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191027A (trigger 593882352.589944 / 191027638).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 185.5, Dec = 30.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 22m, 30d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 33.0 degrees.
