S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:18:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a peak consistent with the flare star UV Cet (trigger=593744). 
Swift could not slew to the location due to the Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 24.764, -17.961, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 39m 03s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 57' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed no obvious
activity, as is typical for a 64 second image trigger. 

Because of the Sun constraint, Swift will not be able to observe
this source with the XRT and UVOT at this time. 

Although the image peak was of marginal significance (6.28 sigma)
the close proximity to the known source location (0.013 degrees) and its
status as a flare star make it highly likely that this is
a real astrophysical event.
