We imaged the field of Swift GRB 071013 (Marshall, F. E. et al. GCN6907) 
with the 1.04m telescope at NainiTal ~ 5 hours after the burst. 
Observations were performed in R and I bands in poor sky conditions.

No afterglow candidate was found in our combined images within the error 
region of BAT.
The 3-sigma limit derived form USNO-B1.0 is I ~20 mag.
