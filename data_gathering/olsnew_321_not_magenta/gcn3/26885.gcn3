K.L. Page reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The automated Swift-XRT refined analysis circular (GCN Circ. 26884)
provided an incomplete description of the X-ray light-curve of GRB
200125A. The PC mode data collected between 10 and 28 ks show an
approximately constant count rate of ~0.15 count s^-1. We therefore do not
give a prediction for T+24 hours.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00952164.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
