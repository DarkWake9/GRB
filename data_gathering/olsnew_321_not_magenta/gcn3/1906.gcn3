G. Bourban, F. Carrier, A. D'Alessandro, L. Weber and G. Burki
(Geneva Observatory) report:

We have carried out observations of the field of INTEGRAL GRB 030227
using the C2 CCD Camera (12'x 12') on the Swiss 1.2-meter telescope
at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile), beginning at 00:50 UT 
on 2003 February 28.  We obtained three images in the R band and one
in the V band each with an exposure time of 480 s. 
The comparison between these images and the DSS does not allow us
to unambiguously detect the optical afterglow to GRB 030227 with
a V- and R-limit of 19.5 and 21 respectively.
In our images no object is present in the
XMM_Newton error circle (GCN #1901 and #1904).
