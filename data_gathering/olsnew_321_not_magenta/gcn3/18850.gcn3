The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

We have performed a parameter estimation analysis assuming that G211117 is
a binary coalescence event with (RA,Dec) constrained to be the position of
PS15dpn (Smith et al., GCN 18786; Chambers et al., GCN 18811) and allowing
for calibration uncertainties in the LIGO detectors.  Our preliminary
analysis finds a posterior probability distribution for redshift with a
central 90% credible interval of 0.07 to 0.13.  There is almost no support
for a source at the redshift reported for PS15dpn, z=0.175 (GCN 18811;
also Cenko et al., GCN 18848, measured z=0.174), although it is not entirely
ruled out.
