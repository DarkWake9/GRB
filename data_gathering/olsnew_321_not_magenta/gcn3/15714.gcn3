E. Bissaldi (University & INFN Trieste), E. Sonbas (Adiyaman University),
F. Longo (University & INFN Trieste), and J. Racusin (NASA/GSFC),
report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:


Starting at 06:18:37.94 on January 10th, 2014, Fermi LAT detected
high energy emission from GRB 140110A, which was also detected
by Fermi-GBM (trigger 411027520).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be RA, Dec 28.90, -36.26 (J2000)
with an error radius of 0.50 deg (90% containment, statistical error only).
This was 30 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

Only the first 1300 s of LAT data have been processed.
They show a significant increase in the event rate within 5 degrees
of the GBM location after the GBM trigger that is spatially and temporally
correlated with the GBM emission with high significance.
Around 20 photons above 100 MeV are observed within 200 seconds.
The highest energy photon is a 735 MeV event which is observed
160 seconds after the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is
Elisabetta Bissaldi (Elisabetta.Bissaldi@ts.infn.it).


The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band
from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific 
institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
