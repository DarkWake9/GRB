M. Andreev (Terskol Branch of INASAN), E. Mazaeva (IKI), V. Kozlov (IC 
AMER, NASU), A. Sergeev (Terskol Branch of INASAN), A. Pozanenko (IKI) 
report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160227A (Siegel et al., GCN 19098) with 
Zeiss-600 telescope of Mt. Terskol observatory in R-filter starting on 
Feb. 27 (UT) 19:45:26. We obtained several images in R-filter. We 
clearly detect source in coordinates (J2000) 12 59 13.7 +78 40 44.9 
which is apparently the afterglow of GRB GRB 160227A (Siegel et al., GCN 
19098; Gorbovskoy et al., GCN 19099). The afterglow is clearly detected 
in a single images of 30 s exposure with brightness of ~19.0 magnitude 
in R-filter at Feb. 27 (UT) 19:49:36.
