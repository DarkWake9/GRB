Adria C. Updike and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100925A / MAXI J1659-152 (Mangano et
al., GCN 11296) using the SARA-South 0.6m telescope located at CTIO
beginning 15 hours after the trigger and continuing for 3 hours in the
BVRI Bessel filters under good conditions.  We clearly detect the
source (Marshall, GCN 11298) in each image.
