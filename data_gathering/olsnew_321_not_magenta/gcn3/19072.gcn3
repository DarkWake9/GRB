E. Mazaeva (IKI), R. Inasaridze (AbAO), V. Ayvazian (AbAO), A. Volnova 
(IKI), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger
GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift and Fermi GRB 160223A (Markwardt et
al., GCN 19057; Veres  et al., GCN 19064) with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of 
Abastumani Observatory starting on Feb. 23 (UT) 23:51:22. We obtained 
several unfiltered images of the field. We do not detect afterglow 
candidate (Bolmer et al., GCN 19058) down to 20.4m. A preliminary 
photometry of the field is following
