SUBJECT: GRB 091003: Swift UVOT Detection of a Candidate UV Afterglow

C. Gronwall (PSU) and R.L.C. Starling (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 091003
approximately 15.5 hours after the Fermi/GBM trigger (Rau,
GCN Circ. 9983).  In a 885 sec observation in the uvw2 filter, we
find a faint candidate fading UV afterglow within the XRT error circle
(Starling & Beardmore, GCN Circ. 9986).  The estimated magnitude is
21.02 +/- 0.27.  This value is not corrected for the Galactic
extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of
the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
