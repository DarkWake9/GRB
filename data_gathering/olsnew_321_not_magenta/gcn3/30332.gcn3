The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:57:20 UT on 27 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210627B (trigger 646509445.742424 / 210627748).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 234.8, Dec = -6.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 39m, -6d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
