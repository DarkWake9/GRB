TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1827
SUBJECT: GRB 030115: Radio detection of IR candidate
DATE:    03/01/17 14:13:23 GMT
FROM:    Dale A. Frail at NRAO  <dfrail@nrao.edu>

D. A. Frail (NRAO), and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"Radio observations made with the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on
2003 January 17.42 UT detect a weak radio source coincident with the
IR afterglow candidate detected by Levan et al. (GCN1818). The flux
density at the position of the IR source is 94+/-22 uJy.  At this same
position two days earlier (GCN1817) no source was seen with a measured
flux density at the postion of the IR candidate of -86+/- 62 uJy.

Further observations are planned."
