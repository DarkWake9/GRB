On Line Availability of Archival HETE Fregate Data and Lightcurves

HETE FREGATE Team;

In GCN Circulars 2421 and 2444, the HETE team announced that HETE
Fregate lightcurves and results of first-cut spectral analyses would
be published to the HETE web page (http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts)
within minutes of reception of the full burst data set from the
satellite. This procedure has been followed since its inception in
October 2003.

In response to additional requests from the astronomical community,
the HETE team is now making lightcurves and results of spectral
analyses available for the full set of localized GRBs detected by
HETE, beginning with bursts localized in December 2000.  The data
are accessible at http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/Data:  the current
data set includes 64 bursts localized through the end of 2003.  As
currently posted, for each burst the data set includes: burst name,
classification, J2000 coordinates, redshift (if known), Epeak, t90,
fluence (30-400 keV), lightcurve, and a skymap.  A description of
the relevant data sets and details regarding their analysis is also
posted on that page;  a more complete description of the spectral and
temporal characteristics of these bursts, including references, will
be published on astro-ph and in refereed journals.

The distribution of prompt analysis results will continue in the manner
outlined in GCN #2421 and #2444, and those observers interested in
characteristics of bursts detected recently should continue to refer to
the web pages of individual bursts at http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts;
the "archival" data set will also be updated on a regular basis.

Questions or comments on the archival data set should be addressed to
Roland Vanderspek (roland@space.mit.edu)
