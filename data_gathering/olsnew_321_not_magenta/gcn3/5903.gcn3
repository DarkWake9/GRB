We observed the optical afterglow detected by SWIFT-UVOT (Vanden Berk et 
al. GCN 5856) of GRB 061126
(swift trigger=240766, Sbarufatti et al. GCN 5854) in VRI bands using 
the 1.0-m Sampurnanand Telescope
located at ARIES, Nainital on 26 November 2006. Several exposures in VRI 
bands were taken and the
field was calibrated by imaging the Landolt Standard SA 95 region on the 
same night. The R band magnitude
of the afterglow is the following:

#Days since burst        Magnitude     Exposure time
         0.41                   20.98 ± 0.10       300
         0.42                   21.04 ± 0.09       900
         0.49                   21.34 ± 0.10      1800
         0.56                   21.49 ± 0.10      1800

The observations between 0.41 to 0.56 d gives a power law decay index of 
~ 1.4 which is different than the
power law index of ~ 1.0 mentioned by Rol et al. (GCN 5876) but 
consistent with the power law decay index
of ~ 1.5 mentioned by Pozanenko et al. (GCN 5902).
