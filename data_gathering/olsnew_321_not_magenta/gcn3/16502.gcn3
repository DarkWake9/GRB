The bright GRB 140619C (localized by IPN: Hurley et al., GCN 16427;
Konus-Wind detection: Golenetskii et al., GCN 16429) triggered the Suzaku
Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy range of 50 keV -
5 MeV at UT 22:46:01.623 (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure, consisting of
two separated episodes: the first one lasting from T0 to T0+6 s, and the
second brighter one lasting from T0+70 s to T0+94 s,  with a total 
duration (T90) of about 87 seconds. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 
4.34 (+0.21, -0.23)x10^-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux measured from 
T0+75 s was 8.32 (+1.12, -1.17) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0 to
T0+92 s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index of 2.50
(+0.15, -0.14) (chi^2/d.o.f = 15.4/14).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
There might be some calibration uncertainties in spectral parameters
since the GRB photons came through the X-ray micro-calorimeter (XRS) dewar.
