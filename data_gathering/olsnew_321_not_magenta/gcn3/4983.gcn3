" We performed IR follow-up observations with CFHT/WIRCam from 8 hours
after the GRB. The afterglow was detected in JHKs bands clearly. The
afterglow brightness estimated from 2MASS catalog is Ks = 16.8 +/-0.1
at 8.11 hours after the burst. During our observational period, the
decay index is about 1 in Ks band. "
