E. Berger (Carnegie), S. R. Kulkarni, A. Rau (Caltech), and D. B. Fox
(Penn State) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

"Starting on 2006, Feb 23.2875 UT (39 min after the burst) we obtained
spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 060223 (GCNs
4813,4814) using LRIS on the Keck-I 10-m telescope.  In a single 720 sec
exposure we detect a broad absorption profile which we identify as
Lyman-alpha at a redshift z=4.41, as well as metal absorption features
from OI, SiII, SiII*, etc at the same redshift."
