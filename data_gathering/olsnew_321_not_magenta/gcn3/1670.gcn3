Weidong Li, R. Chornock, S. Jha, and A. V. Filippenko (UCB) report:

"Analyses of the images of the GRB021104 field taken by KAIT from 4 Nov
2002 09:47 UT to 11:18 UT showed that the possible afterglow reported
in GCN #1668 did not vary in brightness, thus confirmed the finding
by Fox and Price in GCN #1669. 

Corrigendum: in GCN #1668, the observation time should be "4 Nov 2002",
also, the last sentence 'GRB020813' should be 'GRB021104'. Thanks 
to Jean-Luc Atteia of LAOMP, Observatoire Midi-Pyrenees (France) for
the quick alert to these mistakes."
