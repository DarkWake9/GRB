TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2414
SUBJECT: IPN detection of continued activity from SGR1806-20

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind observed this event at 12424 seconds on October
08.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  0.1
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  1.8E-05 erg/cm2 s over 0.03125 seconds.
It was followed approximately 50 seconds later by a second event
with roughly one-third the intensity.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 347.828, -18.495 degrees, whose radius is 70.687 +/-  0.010
degrees (3 sigma).

The center line of this annulus passes 0.001 degrees from the position
of SGR1806-20, and 0.117 degrees from the position of the AXP XTE
J1810-197, excluding the latter as a possible source.  This burst
probably originated from SGR1806-20, but we note that the annulus also
intersects the error circle of the possible new SGR1808-20.

This localization may be improved.
