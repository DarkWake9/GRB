A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), S. Schulze (PUC, MAS), M. Bremer (IRAM), S. Mart√≠n (JAO), J. M. Winters (IRAM) report on behalf a larger collaboration:

We conduced millimetre observations of GRB160131A (Page et al., GCN 18951) with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA; Plateau de Bure, France) at 93 and 150 GHz. Observations started at 17:05 UT on February 1 (i.e. 1.36 days after the burst).

We clearly detect the afterglow at both frequencies. A preliminary analysis of the 93 GHz data reveals a flux density of 1.94 +/- 0.07 mJy. Further observations are scheduled.

We encourage follow-up observations at all frequencies.
