D. A. Perley and A. M. Cockeram (LJMU) report:

We obtained additional observations of the afterglow of GRB 190829A 
(Dichiara et al., GCN 25552; Lesage et al., GCN 25575; Xu et al., GCN 
25555) with the IO:O imager on the 2m robotic Liverpool Telescope.  A 
single epoch consisting of two 150s exposures in both i and z bands was 
acquired on 2019-09-01 between 04:11 and 04:22 (UT).  The afterglow has 
faded significantly since our previous observation (GCN 25585).

We report the following magnitudes after subtraction of the presumptive 
host galaxy using PS1 catalog images (times relative to the Swift 
trigger, in days):

   t-t0    filt   mag       unc
   ------  ----   -----     ----
   2.3438  i    = 21.60 +/- 0.12
   2.3478  z    = 20.99 +/- 0.20

We infer a decay index (t^-alpha) of approximately 1.3.
