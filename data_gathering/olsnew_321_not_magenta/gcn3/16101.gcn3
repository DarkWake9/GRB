V. D'Elia (ASDC) and L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) report for the Swift/XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 140413A at 00:46:31.37 UT, 2211.2 seconds after the BAT trigger. We find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 65.4544, -51.1831 which is equivalent to:
 RA(J2000)  =+04h 21m 49.0s
 Dec(J2000) =-51d 10' 59.1"
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This location is 80 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received.
