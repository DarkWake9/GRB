GRB 090831A, reported in GCN 9850 (Rau)  as Fermi/GBM trigger
273396998 / 090831317,  and as a MAXI event  in GCN 9852 (Matsuoka et al.),
and as a Konus event in GCN 9861 (Golenetskii et al.), was also detected by
Suzaku-WAM and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS).

We have triangulated this burst to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=155.584 (10h 22m 20s) Dec(2000)=+3.772 (+3d 46' 21"),
with a radius of 49.244 ± 0.177 deg (3 sigma).

The Konus-WAM  annulus is centered at
RA(2000)=155.807 (10h 23m 14s)  Dec=+3.771 (+3d 46' 16"), with a
radius of 49.210 ± 0.249 deg (3 sigma).

The Konus-SPI-ACS annulus is centered at
RA(2000)=156.539 (10h 26m  09s)  Dec(2000)=-3.361 (-3d 21' 41"), with
radius of 56.520 ± 0.412 deg (3 sigma).

A map is posted at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB090831_T27393/IPN/
showing the GBM best-fit position (blue star), the MAXI localization circle
and best-fit position (pink star), and the IPN annuli (solid lines with
centers dot-dashed). The shaded area shows the intersection of the
Konus-GBM annulus with the 1-deg MAXI localization circle.
The maximum distance between points on this overlapping region is 1.47 deg,
at coordinates RA, Dec = 143.985 (09h 35m 56s) +51.878 (+51d 52'
40") and 146.304 (09h 45m 13s)   +52.229 (+52d 13' 46").
The area of this region is 0.160 sq. deg.

This map will also be posted at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/090831A.

The IPN localization may be improved.
