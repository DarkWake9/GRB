A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia
(ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), T.G.R. Roegiers (PSU), L.M. McCauley
(PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S.L. Gibson (U. Leicester) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 160409A, collecting 3.0 ks of Photon
Counting (PC) mode data between T0+240.0 ks and T0+246.7 ks. 

No uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the
Swift/BAT error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field ranges
from ~0.004 to ~0.005 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed
flux of 1.7e-13 to 2.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB
spectrum).

A previously-catalogued X-ray source has been detected inside or close
to the Swift/BAT error region, however because it is a catalogued
object it is unlikely to be the afterglow.

An uncatalogued was detected, however this was too far from the GRB
position to be the afterglow.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020604.
