The MAXI GRB 200514A (Okamoto et al., GCN Circ. 27735) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:21:11.346 UTC on 14 May 2020 (trigger
#1273457651). The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a weak pulse which starts at T+1.6 sec and
ends at T+7.5 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
5.1 +- 1.1 sec and 2.5 +- 1.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
