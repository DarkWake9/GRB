V. Mangano (PSU), P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:


We have analysed 5 ks of XRT data for the Fermi/GBM-detected burst:
GRB 140606B,  from 184.4 ks to 192.6 ks after the  Fermi/GBM trigger.
The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.
Using 4979 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 4 UVOT
images, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue): RA, Dec =
328.12501, 32.01458 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  21 52 30.00
Dec (J2000): +32 00 52.5

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
This position is a 5.2 arcsec from source iPTF 14bfu from
GCN Circular 16360.

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

We cannot determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020384.
