report on behalf of the Watcher collaboration:

The Watcher 0.4 m telescope, located at the Boyden Observatory, South
Africa, began observing the location of GRB060926 at 16:49:44 UT (61s
after the burst). Initial observations were carried out under twilight 
conditions, restricting Watcher's limiting magnitude for these early 10s 
unfiltered exposures to ~ 13mag. We do not detect any new source down to 
this limit.
Further observations and analysis are ongoing, as observing conditions 
improve.
