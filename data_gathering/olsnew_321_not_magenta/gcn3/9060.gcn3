D. A. Frail (NRAO), P. Chandra (RMC), and B. Cenko (UC Berkeley)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a field toward the optical afterglow (GCN Circ. 9046, GCN
Circ. 9048) of the Fermi GBM/LAT GRB 090328 (GCN Circ. 9044, GCN
Circ. 9057) on March 30.99 UT using the Very Large Array (VLA) at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. We detect an unresolved radio source at the GRB
afterglow position with a flux density of 337+/-60 uJy at a (J2000)
position of:

RA  =  06h 02m 39.67s
DEC = -41d 52' 53.8"

with a conservative error of 0.25" The source was not detected (<180
uJy) in observations taken 24 hours earlier. Further observations are
planned.

Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
