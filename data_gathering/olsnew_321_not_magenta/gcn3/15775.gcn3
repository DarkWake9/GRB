D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 140129A (Melandri et al., GCN 15760) 
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy starting at 
04:57:21 UT, 94 minutes after the GRB trigger.  Observations continued 
until 06:10:30 UT (source elevation = 19 degrees).  No source is 
detected at the optical afterglow location to a limiting flux of <1.8 
mJy (3 sigma).

We thank C. Hull, N. Volgneau, and the CARMA staff for this rapid 
observation.
