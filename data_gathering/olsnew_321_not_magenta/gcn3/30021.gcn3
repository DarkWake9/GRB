Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210515C (trigger #1048618)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 30020).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 1.106, -14.972 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 04m 25.4s
   Dec(J2000) = -14d 58' 18.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at
~T-3 s, peaks at ~T+1 s, and ends at ~T+11 s, with some tail emission
lasting until ~T+60 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 55.7 +- 26.7 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.53 to T+56.90 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.26 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
5.9 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+0.84 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
