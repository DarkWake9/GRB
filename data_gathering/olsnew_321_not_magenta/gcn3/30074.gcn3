The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:20:34 UT on 24 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210524B (trigger 643548039.686002 / 210524473).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 148.5, Dec = 7.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 54m, 7d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 92.0 degrees.
