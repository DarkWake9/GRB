behalf of a Chinese Gravitational Wave collaboration:

We have performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G268556 (LVC, GCN
20364) using the Nanshan One-meter Wide field Telescope (NOWT),
Xinjiang, China, the 0.6/0.9-m Schmidt telescope at Xinglong, Hebei,
China, and the 1-m telescope at Xuyi, Jiangsu, China.

The Nanshan 1-m has a FOV of 1.3x1.3 deg^2, and covered the position of
ATLAS17aeu (Tonry et al. GCN 20382), the potential optical afterglow of
GRB 170105A (e.g., Marcinkowski et al., GCN 20387; Sharma et al., GCN
20389; Kasliwal, et al., GCN 20393), in a single night. We obtained an
upper limit of m(V)>20.0 mag (3 sigma) at 14:55 UT on 2017-01-07.

The 0.6/0.9-m Schmidt telescope has a FOV of  1.5x1.5 deg^2, and covered
the position of ATLAS17aeu also in a single night. We obtained an upper
limit of m(White)>18.8 mag (5 sigma) at 18:26 UT on 2017-01-08.

The Xuyi 1-m has a FOV of 3.0x3.0 deg^2, and covered the position of
ATLAS17aeu in a single night. We obtained an upper limit of m(r)>14 mag
(3 sigma) at  14:32 UT on 2017-01-09.

In addition, we note that the two sources, dubbed EWE001 and EWE002, in
GCN 20394, are obviously known sources in several surveys such as DSS II
and SDSS.
