report:

"The error box of GRB 991208 (Hurley et al., GCN  450) was observed with the 
Tautenburg Schmidt telescope on 1999 Dec. 11.21 UT in the I band. An object was 
found whose position corresponds to that of the VLA radio source which is a 
strong candidate for the afterglow from GRB 991208 (Frail et al. 1999, GCN 451).
This optical source is not visible in the Digitized Sky Survey. The detection of
the radio and optical sources which coincide in their positions within the
astrometric errors strongly supports the view that their origin is the afterglow
of the GRB. Photometric calibration of the I-band image is in progress. The
comparison of the brightness of the newly found object with nearby USNO stars
indicates an I magnitude of about 19...19.5 mag. The presence of the optical
source is confirmed by independent observations of Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN
452). The image can be found at
