Gary Henson, Shannon Hall, Mark Gorski (ETSU/SARA REU), Adria Updike,
Dieter Hartmann (Clemson University) report:

The 0.9m SARA telescope located at Kitt Peak National Observatory began
imaging the field of GRB 090531A (Stamatikos et al., GCN 9454) about 2.5
hours after the burst under decent weather conditions.  In one hour of
stacked exposures, we detect no new sources down to a limiting magnitude
of R > 20.5 (with respect to the USNO B.1 catalog).  No further
observations are planned.
