(UBAI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 130907A (Page et al., GCN 15183) with 
AZT-22 telescope equipped with SNUCAM of Maidanak observatory starting 
Sep., 10  (UT) 11:04:47. We obtained 2 frames with exposures of 300 s in 
R filter. On stacked images we clearly detect the source reported by Lee 
et al., (GCN 15192). The astrometry of the source is following

RA(J2000) 14 23 34.01
Dec(J2000) +45 36 36.6
with uncertainty of 0.18 arcsec in both coordinates.

The details of the photometry are following:

t_start, filter Exposure, t-t0,      OT
(UT)            sec       mid,days
11:04:47 R      2*300     2.56166    21.44 +/- 0.16

The photometry is based on a nearby SDSS-DR9 star J142338.63+453547.2 
with R mag = 18.181 +/- 0.013 (transformation by Lupton 2005)
