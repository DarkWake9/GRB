S. Belkin (IKI, HSE), A. Pozanenko (IKI), V. Rumyantsev (CrAO),  N. 
Pankov (IKI, HSE) report on behalf of IKI GRB FuN:

We observed the GRB 210610A (Page  et al., GCN  30160) with ZTSH 2.6m 
telescope of CrAO observatory on June 10 starting on (UT) 18:29:17, and 
June 11 starting on (UT) 18:53:09.  The optical afterglow  first 
reported by UVOT (Page  et al., GCN 30160) is clearly detected in each 
of a single images in R filter in both epochs.
Preliminary photometry of the afterglow in the first image on June 10, 
and combined image on the June 11 is following

The light curve of can be found in 
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB210610A/GRB210610A_LC.png

Initial power law index  of the light curve in the first epoch is about 
-0.82, and it is steepening between the two epochs down to -1.03 which 
is compatible with broken power-law fit reported by D.A. Kann  et al. 
(GCN 30211).
