The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:16:34 UT on 14 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190914A (trigger 590141799.630546 / 190914345).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 18.4, Dec = 21.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 13m, 21d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54.0 degrees.
