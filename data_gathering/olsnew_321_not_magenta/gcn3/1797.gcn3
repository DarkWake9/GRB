TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses triggered on a very short, weak event which may correspond
to this INTEGRAL SPI burst (GCN 1794).  It had a 25-100 keV
fluence of approximately 2E-07 erg/cm2 and a peak flux over 0.25
s of ~8E-07 erg/cm2 s.  Triangulation gives an annulus centered
at RA, Decl.(2000)= 1.233, -38.196 degrees, with radius 40.100 +/- 0.032 
degrees (3 sigma).  As this annulus does not include any of the
known SGRs and does not intersect the Galactic plane, the
event is likely to be a short/hard GRB.

Given the low frequency of such triggers on Ulysses, this event
is likely to be the INTEGRAL one, but because it is so weak,
this requires confirmation by other spacecraft.
