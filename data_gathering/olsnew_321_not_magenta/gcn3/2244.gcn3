SUBJECT: GRB 030329/SN 2003dh: Possible increase in brightness

K. Z. Stanek, D. W. Latham (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA) and M. E. Everett
(Planetary Sciences Institute) report:

We imaged the SN 2003dh (Matheson et al. GCN 2107, 2120; Garnavich et
al. IAUC 8108, 8114; Stanek et al. astro-ph/0304173) associated with
the GRB 030329 with the FLWO 1.2-m telescope between May 20 UT 05:45
and May 23 UT 04:30 (51.75 and 54.7 days after the burst) using
standard R filter. The transient seems to brighten during that time:

Observations using larger telescopes, also in other bands, are
strongly encouraged.

Any use of these data should include proper reference to this GCN.
