We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB030323,
originally reported by Henden et al. GCN 1949, with the
SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO. We obtained 29, 300s
exposures in the Johnson R band filter.  Observations
began at 03:32:56UT, and ended at 07:22:56UT, on March
25th.  The obsevations were carried out under good seeing
conditions.  Aperture photometry was performed, and
calibrated utilizing standards reported by Henden et al.,
GCN 1948.

We find a mean R magnitude of 20.6 +- 0.1.
