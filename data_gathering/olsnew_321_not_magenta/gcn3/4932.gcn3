E. Semkov (IA, BAS) on behalf of the BAS/CNRS collaboration report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060218 (Cusumano et al., GCN 4775;
Marshall et al., GCN 4800) with the 2m RCC telescope at the National
Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria) on Mar. 21 and 26. The
calibration was made using comparison stars from Hicken et al. (GCN 4898)
and Modjaz et al. (astro-ph/0603377). Observations were made under good
atmospheric conditions through a standard Johnson-Cousins set of filters.

The optical counterpart was detected at the following magnitudes:
