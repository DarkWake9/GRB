Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210421A (trigger #1044426)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 29849).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 104.882, 4.928 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  06h 59m 31.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +04d 55' 41.2"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 44%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~60 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 79.52 +- 26.78 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-21.74 to T+73.22 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.10 +- 0.72,
and Epeak of 35.2 +- 8.5 keV (chi squared 61.93 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+2.47 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
2.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 2.10 +- 0.13 (chi squared 69.44 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
