E. A. Hoversten (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT observed GRB 091102 (Hoversten et al., GCN Circ 10117) with a
finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter starting
985 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image
covers 25% of the BAT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of
sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error
circle. Because of the density of catalogued stars, further analysis
is required to report an upper limit for any afterglow in the
region. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.07.
