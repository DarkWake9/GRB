of Sydney), D. Kaplan (UWM) on behalf of the ASKAP/VAST team

We observed the Southern probability maximum with BETA - the ASKAP 
engineering test array. The observations cover a 7x7 degree square 
centered on 13h02m00s -14d40m00s with 8 pointings, each comprising 9 
beams. We observed at center frequency of 863.5 MHz with a a bandwidth 
of 300 MHz. Observing began at 2015-10-22 22:35:51 UT and continued for 
10 hrs. Due to the proximity of the Sun, we expect worse than normal 
imaging fidelity.

Analysis of these data are ongoing.
