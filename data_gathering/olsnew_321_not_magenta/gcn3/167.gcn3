TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  167
SUBJECT: GRB 981220: BeppoSAX/GRBM results
DATE:    98/12/24 15:40:36 GMT
FROM:    Filippo Frontera at ITESRE CNR  <filippo@tesre.bo.cnr.it>

F. Frontera and L. Amati (ITESRE/CNR, Bologna),
M. Feroci and E. Costa (IAS/CNR, Rome)
report on behalf of the BeppoSAX/GRBM Team:

"From the high time resolution data the GRBM lightcurve shows a global
three peak structure, with minor (~20-30 ms) structures within
each peak. The time-resolved spectral analysis shows a weak spectral
evolution. The time-averaged spectral power law photon index in the
40-700 keV energy range is (2.1+-0.3).
The peak flux and fluence in the same band are (2.4 +/- 0.4)e-6 ergs/cm2/s
and (1.0+/-0.2)e-5 ergs/cm2, respectively. Please note that the latter
value corrects a typo occurred in Feroci et al. (GCN 159)."
