J. Haislip, A. LaCluyze, C. MacLeod, M. Nysewander, D. Reichart, J. A.
Crain, A. Foster, K. Ivarsen, and J. Kirshbrown report on behalf of the UNC
team of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the localization of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN 4682) with
two of the PROMPT telescopes in Ur'i' between 1.63 and 3.36 hours after the
burst under the automated control of Skynet.

The afterglow (Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) faded from r' = 16.85 +/- 0.05 mag
to r' = 17.83 +/- 0.12 mag over this period (calibrated to five SDSS stars;
Cool et al., GCN 4695.)  The best-fit temporal index is -1.0.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned at CTIO.
