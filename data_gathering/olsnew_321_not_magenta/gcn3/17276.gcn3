Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:23:34.47 UT on 01 January 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150101B (trigger 441818617 / 150101641).
which was also detected by the BAT during a slew (Cummings et al.
2015, GCN 17267).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift/BAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one peak
with a duration (T90) of about 0.08 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.016 s to T0+0.064 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.70 +/- 0.09.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.09 +/- 0.14)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 64-ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.00 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 10.48 +/- 1.35 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
