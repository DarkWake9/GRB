We observed the field of GRB 130803A (Page, et al., GCN 15059) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/08 4.15 to 2013/08 4.25 UTC (17.51
to 19.98 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.53 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.63 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with SDSS DR9
and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r'    > 23.29
  i'    > 23.24
  Z     > 22.27
  Y     > 21.70
  J     > 20.90
  H     > 20.24

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. Our upper limits are consistent
with the detections and upper limits reported by Varela, et al. (GCN 15066).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
