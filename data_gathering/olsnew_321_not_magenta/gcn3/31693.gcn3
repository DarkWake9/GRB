The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:20:00 UT on 6 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220306A (trigger 668244005.521712 / 220306306).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 184.9, Dec = -30.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 19m, -30d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118.0 degrees.
