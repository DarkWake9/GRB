D. Gotz and S. Mereghetti on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team and the
INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

The preliminary peak flux of GRB 040223 in the 20-200 keV range is about
0.4 photons/cmsq/s (3 x 10^-8 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time). Offline
analysis shows besides a main peak lasting about 35 s two fainter peaks
100 and 180 seconds earlier respectively.
