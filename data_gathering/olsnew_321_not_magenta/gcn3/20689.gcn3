TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  20689
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo G274296: Identification of a GW Burst Candidate
DATE:    17/02/17 19:43:13 GMT
FROM:    Peter Shawhan at U of Maryland/LSC  <pshawhan@umd.edu>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:

The CWB Burst analysis identified candidate G274296 during real-time
processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2017-02-17 06:05:55.050 UTC (GPS time:
1171346771.050).  This circular has been sent around 13 hours after
the event due to a processing issue.  G274296 is an event of interest
because its false alarm rate, as determined by the online analysis, is
1.7e-07 Hz or about one in 2 months, passing our alert threshold of
~0.5/month. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/events/G274296

No other GW event candidates were identified within a 300 s window
before or after G274296.

One sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page: skyprobcc_cWB.fits, an initial localization
generated by cWB, distributed via GCN notice about 13 hours after the
event.

The morphology of the event candidate is unclear. We can’t confirm
the shape as a chirp, but we can’t discard it.

Updates on our analysis of this event will be sent as they become
available.
