D. A. Perley, C. M. Copperwheat, and K. L. Taggart (LJMU) report on 
behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen 
(GROWTH) collaboration:

We acquired a series of 60-second exposures of ZTF19aasckkq (Anand et 
al., GCN 24311), an optical transient in the error region of LIGO/Virgo 
S190425z (GCN 24168), using the IO:O imager on the 2m Liverpool 
Telescope in the u, g, r, i, and z filters between 03:17:56 and 03:30:00 
UT on 2019-04-27.

The transient is detected with the following magnitudes (measured after 
image subtraction and calibrated relative to PS1):

JD          	magnitude
2458600.6384	g = 20.66 +/- 0.18
2458600.6395	r = 20.37 +/- 0.17
2458600.6406	i = 20.28 +/- 0.23
2458600.6416	z = 20.09 +/- 0.38

It is not detected in u-band.  These suggest a moderately but not 
extremely red transient and show no obvious evolution relative to the 
ZTF imaging on 2019-04-26 (g = 20.86 +/- 0.18).
