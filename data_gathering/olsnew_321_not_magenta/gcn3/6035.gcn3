We have imaged the field of GRB 070125 with the TNT 0.8m telescope
at Xinglong Observatory started at 10:48 UT 26 Jan. Observation were
performed with R and V filters, the optical afterglow is detected
in all of these frames. Using the reference star derived form USNO
A-2.0 Ra=117.80128d Dec=31.17685d (J2000) R=15.2, we estimate the
afterglow had a mag R~18.73 +/- 0.15 at 10:53 UT. Observations are
continuing.
