SUBJECT: GRB 160417A: KAIT optical afterglow confirmation

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report
on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 160417A (D'Avanzo et al.,
GCN 19316) about 10 minutes after the trigger. Observations were
performed with an automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V,
and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image.
Inside the XRT error circle we detected an un-cataloged 
source with coordinates of :

RA =  08:01:01.64 (J2000)
DEC= +07:39:46.60 (J2000)

The object location is consistent with the position reported
from UVOT (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 19316). The object has clear band mag
of ~17.9 about 10 minutes after the burst.

Follow-up observations are encouraged.
