behalf of the Swift Team:

At 02:38:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070612 (trigger=282066). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 121.385, +37.266  which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 05m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = +37d 15' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single hard-
spectrum FRED peak with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count 
rate was ~1100 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~-1 sec after the trigger. 

Because of a Sun constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no XRT or UVOT data 
products to analyze.  XRT and UVOT will not be able to observe this 
target until the end of August.
