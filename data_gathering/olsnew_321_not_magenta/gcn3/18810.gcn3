and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 151231A (Veres et al. GCN Circ. 18787) triggered the CALET 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 10:37:53.15 UT on 31 December 2015.  The 
clear burst signal was detected by all instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows two main peaks.  The first peak starts at T0-2 sec, 
peaks at T0 and ends at T0+5 sec.  The second peak starts at T0+50 sec, peaks at 
T0+60 sec and ends at T0+70 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 
66.0 +- 0.7 sec (40-1000 keV).  

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
