report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-07-06T13:42:25.95 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190706C (trigger ID: HEB190706571) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (trigger #8325),
CALET/CGBM (GCN #25038) and Konus-Wind (GCN #25042).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a multiple  
pulses with a duration (T90) of 2.88 s measured from T0+0.13 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+2.76 s, is 25839 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 32484 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
