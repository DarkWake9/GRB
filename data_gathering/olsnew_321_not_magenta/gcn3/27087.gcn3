report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:39:31.85 UT on 15 February 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 200215A (trigger 603470376 / 200215611),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Bernardini et al. 2020, GCN
27079).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 86
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright pulse followed by some
extended emission with a duration (T90) of about 24 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.09 s to T0+5.12 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.76 +/- 0.16 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 162 +/- 25 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.858 +/- 0.175)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+0.06 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
