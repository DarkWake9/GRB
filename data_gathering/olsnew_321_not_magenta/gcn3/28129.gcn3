J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), J.P.
Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U.
Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo
(INAF-OAB) and T.N. Ukwatta report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 200716C (Ukwatta et al. GCN
Circ. 28124), from 86 s to 23.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 578 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 28128). We cannot determine at the
present time whether the source is fading.

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.56 (+/-0.03). The
best-fitting absorption column is  5.8 (+1.0, -0.9) x 10^20 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.45 (+0.13, -0.05)
and a best-fitting absorption column consistent with the Galactic
value. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.4 x 10^-11 (4.4 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.1 (+2.3, -0.0) x 10^20 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: <1.6 sigma
Photon index:	     1.45 (+0.13, -0.05)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.46, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 8.5 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.7 x
10^-13 (3.8 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
