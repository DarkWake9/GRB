P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) and S.R.Oates (MSSL-UCL) reports on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

Swift UVOT began settled exposures of GRB090401B (Schady et al, GCN 9066) 
82 s after the burst trigger, and detected a bright optical transient at 
the position reported in by Schady et al. (GCN 9067), consistent with the 
enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne et al, GCN 9070).

The source is detected in the white, v, b and u filter, but not in any of 
UV filters, placing an upper limit on the redshift of z < 3. We note that 
the afterglow lies close to a known source, which may be contaminating our 
phometry. The light curve decays steeply at early times at a rate of 
alpha_1~1.5, and then breaks at ~T+440s to a slope of alpha_2~0.7.

Using 2.5arcsec aperture, the magnitudes and 3 sigma upper
limits to our observations our reported below:

Filt    T_start (s)  T_stop (s)  Exp (s)  Mag/3-sig UL
white      82           232       147     16.83+/-0.02

uvw1       672          1297      78        > 19.42
uvm2       647          1272      78        > 18.99
uvw2       599          1387      78        > 19.39

The above magnitudes have not been corrected for the Galactic extinction 
corresponding to E(B-V) = 0.67 (Schlegel et al 1998). The photometry is on 
the UVOT flight system described in Poole et al (2008, MNRAS, 383,627)
