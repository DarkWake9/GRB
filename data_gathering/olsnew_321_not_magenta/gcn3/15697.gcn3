SUBJECT: GRB 140105A: HCT Observations

V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), Vaidehi S. Paliya (IIA), G. C. Anupama (IIA), and 
C. S.
Stalin (IIA) report:

We undertook followup observations of the four optical transients 
(Singer et
al., GCN 15686) in the Fermi GBM error circle for GRB 140105A (Xiong &
Connaughton, GCN 15688) with the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). 
We
obtained two 300s exposures of each field, under non-photometric 
conditions.

20 hours after the burst, we obtain the following unsubtracted 
magnitudes in
the R band:
iPTF14ae = 20.1 +- 0.1
iPTF11ai = 19.8 +- 0.2
iPTF11x  = 19.1 +- 0.3

iPTF11ac is contaminated by a nearby star, and we can only place a limit 
that
R > 18.4 mag. We concur with Singer et al. (GCN 15696) that the lack of 
fading
rules out these candidates as counterparts to GRB 140105A.

We thank the iPTF team for alerting us about this event.
