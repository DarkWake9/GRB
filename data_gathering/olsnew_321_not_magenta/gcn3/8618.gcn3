J.S. Deng, W.K. Zheng and Y. Urata on behalf of EAFON report:

We have observed GRB081203A (Parsons et al., GCN 8595) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope from Dec.03th,13:57:11(UT),
6.43 hr after the burst to Dec.03,22:19:37.67 (UT).
A series of R band and V band have been obtained.
The optical afterglow was clearly detected in all the images.

Further observations of GRB081203A were also made with 
Xinglong TNT telescope from Dec.04th,21:29:30.409(UT). The 
OT was still marginal detected after combined 11*600s images.

we found the afterglow dacayed from R=19.0 at 7.25 hr to 
R=21.1 at 24.6 hr. The decay slope index is about 1.59, which is
consistent with the index derived from Volkov et al,(GCN 8604).

Further observations are encouraged.
