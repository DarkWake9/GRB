P. Wozniak, J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, and R. White, report on behalf of
the RAPTOR team.
  
Stereoscopic observations collected by the RAPTOR wide-field sky
monitoring systems allow us to place optical limits on a prompt optical
flash from GRB 041211 (HETE trigger 3622). Five seconds after receiving
the initial HETE type 40 trigger, we began tiling around the nominal
HETE pointing direction. Our first image containing the GRB location
began at 11:34:09.93 UT (T+143.02s). This image was 10 seconds in
duration and reached an unfiltered limiting magnitude of 11.5. No new
object was detected within the error circle based on comparison to DSS
image. Later images reaching 15th magnitude also showed no new objects
compared to DSS images.
