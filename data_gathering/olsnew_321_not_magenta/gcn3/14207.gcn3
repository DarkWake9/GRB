On February 15.1 UT (~50 minutes after the BAT trigger) we observed 
the field of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 14204, Zheng et al GCN 
14205) using the KAST Spectrograph on the Lick Shane 3-m telescope.  

The optical candidate is clearly detected.
We obtained a 2x600s spectrum, covering the wavelength range 3500-8000A

The spectrum reveals strong absorption lines of MgII2796, MgII2803,
MgI2853, FeII2586, FeII2600, and Ca H&K.  
A provisional reduction gives a redshift of z=0.597, which we believe 
is most likely the redshift of this burst.
 
We thank the Lick Observatory staff for their prompt support.
