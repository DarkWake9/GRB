Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University) and Todd 
Hillwig (Valparaiso University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB 
Follow-Up Team:

We observed the field of GRB 071020 (GCN 6949, Holland et al.) beginning 
1 hour after the trigger with the SARA 0.9m telescope on Kitt Peak.   In 
48 minutes of stacked exposures, we detect the afterglow (GCN 6948, 
Schaefer et al.) in the R band at 19.7 +/- 0.2, calibrated relative to 
10 field stars in the USNO B1.0 catalog.  Observations ended at 2 hours 
and 11 minutes after the burst.
