Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080210 (trigger #302888)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 7281).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 251.259, 13.826 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 16h 45m 02.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = 13d 49' 35" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows 3-4 overlapping peaks starting at ~T-16 sec,
peaking at ~T+5 sec, and ending at ~T+33 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 45 +- 11 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-14.6 to T+47.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.50 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
