Atish Kamble (Raman Research Institute [RRI], Bangalore, India),
C. H. Ishwara Chandra (NCRA, Pune, India) and D. Bhattacharya (RRI)
report on behalf of a larger GRB collaboration :

The date of GMRT observation of GRB 060218 reported in GCN 4832
has a typo. The correct date of observation was 21 Feb 2006 and
not 20 Feb 2006.

Our apologies for the inconvenience it might have caused.

With further analysis of the data (same observation) we could
improve the upper limits on the radio afterglow flux
of GRB 060218. We now put a 3 sigma upper limit of ~ 0.3 mJy.
