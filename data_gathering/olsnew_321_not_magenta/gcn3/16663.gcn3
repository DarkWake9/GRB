report on behalf of the larger collaboration:

At the night of August 1/2 we observed the GRB 140801A field (Fermi trigger
428612396) with BTA/Scorpio-I. Observations started at 21:10 UT (2.17 hours
after the GRB). The optical transient (Gorbovskoy et al., GCNC 16653; Xu et
al., GCNC 16656, Masi, GCNC 16659) is clearly detected in our V and Rc images
with the brightness R = 20.2 (2.85 hours after the trigger). Photometry
is based on the USNO-B1 star with the coordinates
R. A. = 02:56:16.58, Dec. =  +30:57:02.1 and R2 = 16.06.
The OT magnitude was not corrected for the Galactic extinction
E(B-V) = 0.09 in the direction of the object.

We also obtained an OT spectrum and measured the redshift on basis of several
lines. Our value z =1.319 +/- 0.003 is in a good agreement with that by
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCNC 16657).

We thank T. Fatkhullin for his great assistance in observations.
