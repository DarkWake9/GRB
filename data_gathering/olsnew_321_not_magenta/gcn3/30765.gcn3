F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 00:12:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210905A (trigger=1071993).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 309.062, -44.431 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 36m 15s
   Dec(J2000) = -44d 25' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of at least 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 00:14:13.0 UT, 91.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 309.04815, -44.43959 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 20h 36m 11.56s
   Dec(J2000) = -44d 26' 22.5"
with an uncertainty of 7.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 47 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.23e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
156 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.034.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
