V. Dâ€™Elia (SSDC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We provide an update on the XRT light curve evolution of the candidate X-ray afterglow of GRB 200219C (GCN Circ. 27157).

The XRT light curve now comprises data up to 260 ks from the Fermi trigger (GCN Circs. 27151 and 27155). There is a firm indication of fading with respect to the first observation, with a decay index of 0.8 (+0.4 -0.3). We thus confirm that this is indeed the afterglow of GRB 200219C.
The latest results can be viewed via: https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/00020973/ <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.swift.ac.uk%2Fxrt_curves%2F00020973%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cvalerio.delia%40ssdc.asi.it%7Ccbb05988e1604c1b0a9608d7b9502580%7Ccbfc58d4e60f468d8fe490676de085f7%7C0%7C0%7C637181626207379817&sdata=y0NsJNyq79oZqD4RZJb5be%2Fwwkz6UNNz%2B%2F3wajd%2Bs54%3D&reserved=0>
