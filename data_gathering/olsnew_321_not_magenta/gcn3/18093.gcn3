P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and H.A. Krimm report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 150728A (Krimm et al. GCN
Circ. 18087), from 79 s to 30.0 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for
this burst was given by Beardmore et al. (GCN Circ. 18088). The source
is fading with alpha >0.4.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00650617.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
