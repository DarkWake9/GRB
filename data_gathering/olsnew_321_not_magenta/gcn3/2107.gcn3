We obtained spectra of the afterglow of GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price,
GCN 1985; Torii: GCN 1986) with the 6.5-m MMT and Blue-Channel
spectrograph each night from March 30.12 to April 6.15 (UT). The
spectra cover a wavelength range of 350 nm to 850 nm with a resolution
of 0.6 nm (FWHM). The early spectra consist of a power-law continuum
with narrow emission lines originating from HII regions in the host
galaxy (Martini et al. GCN 2013; Della Ceca et al. GCN 2015; Greiner
et al. GCN 2020; Caldwell et al. GCN 2053).  However, our spectrum
taken Apr. 6.15 (UT) shows a broad peak in flux at approximately 570
nm and another weak deviation from a power-law near 470nm that were
not evident in the earlier spectra.

The April 6 spectrum is well reproduced by adding a spectrum of SN
1998bw (Patat et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 900) seven days before maximum
light to a power-law distribution. We conclude that a supernova
spectrum is emerging from the afterglow light.  The brightness of the
supernova is approximately V=22 based on the strengths of the broad
features relative to a pure power-law. Further spectroscopy is
planned.
