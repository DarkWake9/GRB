We apologize for the wrong result reported in GCN circ. 13500 . 

Caused by a wrong astronomical calibration,
the optical candidate of GRB 120722A reported in GCN circ. 13500 
should be a known object in the USNO B1.0 

Therefore, no any new source within the location of 
XRT counterpart was detected by TNT.  The 3 sigma upper limit
of 21 mag was derived relatively to USNO B1.0 R2 mag.
