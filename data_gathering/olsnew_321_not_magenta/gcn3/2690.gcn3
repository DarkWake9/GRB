TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2690
SUBJECT: Possible GRB 040903 detected with INTEGRAL

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano) and N. Mowlavi (ISDC) on behalf of
the IBAS Localization Team report:

The off-line analysis of IBAS Alert # 1972 reveals a possible GRB of the
duration of 10 s detected in the 15-60 keV energy range. Its coordinates
are (J2000)

R.A. = 18h 03m 22s
Dec. = -25deg 15' 23''

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

Considering the location close to the Galactic Center and the soft
spectrum, we cannot exclude that this burst is due to a new galactic
source. Further analysis is underway.
