The recent Circular from T.Cline was the result of hitting the "reply" key
while reading a recent Circular.  Up until a month ago, there was a protection
against "reply key" scenarios.  This proection was done through the mailer
program by changing the reply-to field in the email header to an address
other than the GCN Circulars address.  However, due to a Y2K non-compliance
of that mailer program, the system administrators here replaced that mailer
 with another that does not allow reply-to field changes.  I have not
been able to impliment another patch to protect against this scenario,
but I am still working on it.

In the meantime, I have rolled back the Circular serial number counter.
This effectively eliminates from the permanant record Cline's email.
The next official Circular will have the 544 serial number.

My apologies for this adddition to your email in-boxes.
