GRB 060510B: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

S. T. Holland (NASA/GSFC & USRA) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT
team:

      The Swift UVOT began observing GRB 060510B (trigger #209351,
Krimm et al., GCN Circular 5096) 111 seconds after the BAT trigger.
No optical afterglow is detected at the location of the optical
afterglow (Mirabal & Halpern 2006, GCN Circular 5097).  The lack of
detection in any UVOT filter is consistent with the burst having a
redshift of z = 4.9 (Price 2006, GCN Circular 5104).
