C. J. Saxton (UCL-MSSL), V. D'Elia (ASDC), S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 07:46:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120714A (trigger=526593).  Swift could not immediately
slew to the location due to the Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 167.970, -30.632 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 11h 11m 53s
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 37' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+51
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. J. Saxton (cjs2 AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
