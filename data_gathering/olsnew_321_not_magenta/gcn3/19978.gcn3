The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for the 
short/hard GRB 160927A (Gibson et al., GCN 19952) as part of the 4pisky 
program, and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 3 
days post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Sep 27.79, Sep 
28.70, and Sep 29.70 (UT; 1 hour, 23 hours, and 47 hours post-burst 
respectively) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Page 
et al., GCN 19958), with 3sigma upper limits of 132 uJy, 119 uJy, and 
110 uJy respectively. The 3sigma upper limit from the first two epochs 
combined is 80 uJy.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
