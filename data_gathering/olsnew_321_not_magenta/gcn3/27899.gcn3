"
At 08:41:49.66 UT on 7 June 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200607A (trigger 613212114 / 200607362).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA =
171.5, Dec = +30.88 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 26m, -30d
52'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 80 degrees.
