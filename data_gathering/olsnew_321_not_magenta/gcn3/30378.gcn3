CZTI collaboration: 

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al,
2020, arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a short GRB 210704A, which
was also detected by Fermi - GBM (Trigger 647120009 / GRB210704815),
Fermi-LAT (GCN 30375), and AGILE/MCAL (GCN 30372). 

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-07-04 19:33:24.4 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with
the burst is 706 (+179, -132) cts/s above the background in the combined
data of four quadrants, with a total of 359 (+106, -109) cts. The local
mean background count rate was 489 (+6, -8) cts/s. Using cumulative
rates, we measure a T90 of 1.0 (+0.4, -0.4) s.  

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector
in the 100-500 keV energy range. In one-second bins, the measured peak
count rate associated with the burst is 1417.7 (+89.9 -97.4) cts/s above
the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of
2430 (+327 -361) cts. The local mean background count rate was 1743.4
(+4.2 -4.2) cts/s. 

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and
facilitated the project.
