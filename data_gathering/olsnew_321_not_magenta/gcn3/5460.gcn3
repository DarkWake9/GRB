The long GRB 060814 (Swift-BAT trigger #224552; Moretti et al., GCN 5447)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=82954.447 s UT (23:02:34.447).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst shows
two main pulses and a weak extended emission seen up to T-T0 ~200s.
The most intense pulse starts at T-T0 ~ -21 s
and has a duration of ~40 s,
the second pulse starts at T-T0 ~38 s and has a duration of ~35 s.
T90 (18-1160 keV) is 134 +- 4 sec.

The burst fluence is 2.69(-0.79, +0.12)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and the 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.576 s
2.13(-0.55, +0.29)x10^-6  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst integrated from T0 to T0+73.984 s
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 1.43(-0.16, +0.15)
and Ep = 257(-58, +122) keV (chi2 = 65/57 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
