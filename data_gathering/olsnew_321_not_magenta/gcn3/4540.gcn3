TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4540
SUBJECT: GRB 060116: UKIRT IR Observations

D. Kocevski, J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), and E. J. McGrath (UH
Institute for Astronomy) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Repeat imaging of the field of GRB060116 with the United Kingdom  
Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) at Mauna Kea begining at 07:28:37.44 UTC  
on Jan 17th shows that the IR source reported by Kocevski et. al.  
(GCN 4528) is no longer detected in our images.  These observations  
are consistent with the results reported by Malesani et. al. (GCN  
4532) and confirms the variability of the source in the J band.  An  
image of the source and it's subtraction from the Jan 17th data can  
be found at: http://spacibm.rice.edu/~kocevski/sub.jpg"
