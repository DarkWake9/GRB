Adria C. Updike (Clemson University), G. Grant Williams (MMTO), Peter A.
Milne (Steward Observatory), and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University)
report:

We observed the field of GRB 100205A (Racusin et al., GCN 10361) with the
0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope located at KPNO under poor conditions.
Observations began 110 seconds after the trigger and continued for 7
minutes before we were forced to close due to humidity.  In 270 seconds of
stacked V-band exposures, we detect no new sources in the XRT error circle
down to a limiting magnitude V > 18 (upon comparison to the NOMAD
catalog), which is consistent with the NOT observations (Malesani et al.,
GCN 10362).
