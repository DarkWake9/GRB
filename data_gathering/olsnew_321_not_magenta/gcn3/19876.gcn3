SUBJECT: GRB 160827A: Swift detection of a burst
DATE:    16/08/27 15:54:29 GMT
FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <scott@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov>

K. L. Page (U Leicester) and S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 15:46:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160827A (trigger=710050).  Swift did not slew due to observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 179.296, -29.159, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 57m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 09' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks
with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~8 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 00:09 UT on 2016 November 14. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (klp5 AT leicester.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
