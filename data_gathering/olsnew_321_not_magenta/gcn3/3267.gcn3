D. A. Frail (NRAO) and A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the field centered on the BAT position of the Swift burst
GRB 050416 (GCN#3264) using the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz and
starting at 11:42 UT, about 37 minutes after the burst. There are no
bright radio sources (> 260 microJy) within 1 arcminute of the BAT
position. At the position of the afterglow candidate of Cenko and Fox
(GCN#3265), the peak radio flux is 20 +/- 51 microJy.

Further observations are planned."
