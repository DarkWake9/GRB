DATE:    02/11/04 11:16:47 GMT
FROM:    Paul Price at RSAA, ANU at CIT  <pap@srl.caltech.edu>

D.W. Fox and P.A. Price (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We note that the candidate optical afterglow reported by Li et al.
(GCN #1668) is visible on the DSS 2 N-emulsion plate.  Hence we
do not consider it a likely candidate for the afterglow of the GRB.
