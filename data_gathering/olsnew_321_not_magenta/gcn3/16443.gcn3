on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long GRB 140619A (Swift-BAT trigger #602080: De Pasquale, et al.,
GCN Circ. 16415, Palmer, et al., GCN Circ. 16423) was detected by
Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single multipeak episode started
at ~T0(BAT)+35 s with a duration of ~340 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140619A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
5.4(-0.5,+0.2)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak energy flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+191 s, of 1.5(-0.3,+0.2)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(BAT)+35 s
to T0(BAT)+374 s) by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.3 Â± 0.1, and Ep = 236 (-27,+33) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
