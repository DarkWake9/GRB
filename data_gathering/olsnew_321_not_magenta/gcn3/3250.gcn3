Brian P Schmidt (Australian National University) and Matthew Whiting 
(UNSW)  report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a 6' region covering the XRT position of  the SWIFT burst 
GRB 050412 (GCN#3237)
using the ANU 2.3m telescope on April 12.27 UT in R band.  The object 
located within the XRT error circle (GCN#3241)  located at RA 
12:04:25.0, Dec -01:12:04 J2000, (GCN#3241, GCN#3243), in comparison 
with the images of Berger et al (GCN#3239), is detected at poor SNR at 
approximately the same brightness. Neither set of images shows the UVOT 
transient object reported by Pooley and Bloom  (GCN#3247) to at least 
R=21mag."
