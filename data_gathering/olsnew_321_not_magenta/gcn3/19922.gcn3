We observed the field of GRB 160912A (Cannizzo et al., GCN 19912) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/09 13.14 to 2016/09 13.24 UTC (11.20 to
13.52 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.76 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.74 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We detect the optical afterglow reported by Tanvir et al. (GCN 19918).  In
comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and (3-sigma) upper limits:

r = 23.05 +/- 0.10
i = 22.73 +/- 0.13
Z = 22.62 +/- 0.31
Y = 22.13 +/- 0.29
J > 21.91
H > 21.72

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
