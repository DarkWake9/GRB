Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward INTEGRAL
GRB 080603A (GCN 7790) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 June 05.39 UT.
We detect a possible radio afterglow at KAIT optical afterglow position
(GCN 7789) at a flux density level of 116 +/- 41 uJy.
