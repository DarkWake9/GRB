D. Frederiks, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, reports:

We have also found a typo in our GCN Circ. 14487 "Konus-Wind observation of GRB 130427A":
the correct energy range for the total K-W energy fluence and the peak flux estimations
for GRB 130427A is 20-10000 keV, not "20 - 1200 keV", as mentioned.

The 20-10000 keV range is a standard for K-W estimations of GRB energetics
in the observer frame.

We thank D.A.Kann for his help in clearing this issue and sorry again for the inconvenience.
