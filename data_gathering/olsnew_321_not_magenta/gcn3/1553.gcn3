E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 17563 s.  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~20 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of
5X10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 5x10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl(2000)=
173.261, +37.976 degrees, with radius 81.616 +/- 0.037 degrees
(3 sigma).  In addition, a preliminary analysis of the Konus
data indicates that the burst arrived from an ecliptic latitude
between +2 and +22 degrees.  This limits the annulus to two sections,
one between RA, Dec=236.8, -17.9 and 252.4, -0.3 degrees, and the
other between RA, Dec=74.3, +24.7 and 55.8, +42.3.  As Mars
Odyssey did not observe this event, it will not be possible
to derive a small error box for it.
