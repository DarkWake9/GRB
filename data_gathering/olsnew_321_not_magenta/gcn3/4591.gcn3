N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) and J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) report for the
MDM GRB follow-up team:

"We have obtained a low-resolution spectrum of the afterglow of
GRB 060124 using the MDM 2.4m telescope and Boller & Chivens (CCDS)
spectrograph.  The observations consist of three 30-minute spectra
beginning on Jan 25.13.  Preliminary analysis reveals one significant
absorption feature, possibly a doublet, at 5105 A.  Assuming that this
corresponds to Mg II 2795,2802, the inferred redshift (or lower limit)
is z=0.82.  Alternatively, if this feature is C IV 1548,1550, then
z=2.30, and a marginally significant absorption feature that we see
at 4008 A could be Lyman alpha.  Independent confirmation of these
features is required."
