MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)  located in South Africa (South African Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB 210308A ( V. D'Elia et al., GCN 29619) errorbox  40899 sec after notice time and 40918 sec after trigger time at 2021-03-08 17:59:54 UT, with upper limit up to  13.9 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith distance = 74 deg. The sun  altitude  is -12.2 deg. 

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB 210308A errorbox  55958 sec after notice time and 55976 sec after trigger time at 2021-03-08 22:10:53 UT, with upper limit up to  18.5 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 48 deg. The sun  altitude  is -40.8 deg. 

The galactic latitude b = -7 deg., longitude l = 164 deg.
