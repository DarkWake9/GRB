We report on Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search observations of GW counterpart
SSS17a/DLTck (eg. Coulter et al., LVC GCN 21529) with the Parkes 64m Radio
Telescope in FRB search mode.

Two 1-hour observations were searched for FRBs with Dispersion Measures
(DMs) ranging from 0 to 2000 pc/cc 2.5 days after the GW event.  The start
UT of the 1hr integrations was 2017-08-20 01:44:32 and 2017-08-20 02:50:14.
No FRBs were detected with a flux limit of 1.4 Jy (w/64 us)^{-1/2} where w
is the width of the FRB in microseconds.  An FRB in the host galaxy might be
expected to have a DM of ~55 pc/cc plus the unknown contribution from any
remnant.  FRBs of luminosity similar to those observed from the repeating
FRB 121102 would be detected at the distance of NGC 4993 with very high
significance (SNR>>100).
