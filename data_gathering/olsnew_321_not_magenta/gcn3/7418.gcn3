We have observed the field of GRB 080315 (Page et al., GCN 7416) with the
1.3m Mercator telescope at La Palma starting at 02:55 UT (30 min after
the burst).
The observation consisted on a series of 24x60s I-band exposures. The
combined
exposure, with mean time 3:26 UT (61.3 minutes after the burst), does not
show
any new source inside the 3 arcmin BAT error box down to a limiting
magnitude
of I~20.8 (USNO-B1.0 was used as photometric reference) as compared to
SDSS
i-band frame.
