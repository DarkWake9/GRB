L. Rhodes (Oxford/MPIfR), R. Fender (Oxford/UCT) and D.R.A. Williams (JBCA) report:


We observed ZTF22aabjpxh/AT2022cva (Ho et al., GCN 31619) with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager - Large Array at 15.5GHz. The observation was made on 27th February 2022 at 04:42UT and lasted 4 hours. We detect a point source at the position of ZTF22aabjpxh with a flux density of 490+/-30uJy. The noise in the field is 34uJy. Subsequent observations show that the source is fading.


We thank the staff at the MRAO for scheduling these observations.
