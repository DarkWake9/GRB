GRB 050408:  Retraction of Proposed Host Galaxy

D. Q. Lamb, D. G. York, and D. E. Reichart report: 


We agree that the galaxy we proposed as the host galaxy of GRB 040508
lies ~ 8 arcsec South-West of the burst afterglow (Kosugi et al., GCN
Circular 3215; Monfardini, GCN Circular 3216) and therefore cannot be
the host galaxy of the burst.
