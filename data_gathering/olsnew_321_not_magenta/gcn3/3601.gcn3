on behalf on a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 050712 (Grupe et al., GCN 3573; Falcone et
al., GCN 3574) with the Italian TNG telescope, located at the Canary
Islands.

The field was observed before twilight, under a seeing of ~1.4 arcsec,
starting on 2003 Jul 13.182 UT (~14.4 h after the GRB). A set of six
images, 300 s exposure time each, was acquired in the R filter.

Within the XRT error circle (Grupe et al., GCN 3579) we find one source,
at a position consistent with that of the OT detected with UVOT (Rol et
al., GCN 3575; see also Zeh et al., GCN 3587).

Assuming R = 15.8 for the USNO-A2.0 star U1500_0409875 at 
RA = 05:11:10.51, Dec = +64:55:36.0 (J2000), we measure for the object 
above a magnitude R = 21.35 +/- 0.05.

Further analysis is in progress.
