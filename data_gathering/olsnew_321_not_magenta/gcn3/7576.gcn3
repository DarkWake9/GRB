K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT Team:

Swift performed a Target of Opportunity observation of the SuperAGILE GRB 
080408 (Soffitta et al., GCN Circ 7571), starting ~25 ks after the 
trigger. The intended observation was cut short by the BAT detection of 
GRB 080409 (Holland et al., GCN Circ. 7573), but a source is still 
detected during the 800 s of data obtained, at a position of RA, Dec = 
114.66547, +33.30341, which is equivalent to

RA(J2000):   07 38 39.71
Dec(J2000): +33 18 12.3

with an uncertainty of 8.6 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This is 38.1 
arcsec from the SuperAGILE position, within their error circle.

The source has a count rate of 0.010 +/- 0.004 count s^-1, however, with 
the limited data, it is not possible to determine whether it is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
