report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2018-11-23T05:33:03.09 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181123B (trigger ID: HEB181123231) in a routine search of the data,
which was also detected by the SWIFT/BAT (J. P. Norris et al. 2018, GCN 23443)

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 0.23 s measured from T0+0.16 s. 
The 50-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.28 s, is 5091.4 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 2060.5 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
