A. Levan (U. Warwick), A. Cucchiara (PSU), N. Tanvir (U. Leicester),
D. Fox (PSU) & E. Berger (Harvard U.) report:

We re-observed the field of GRB 090429B with NIRI on Gemini-N,
beginning about 30-Apr 08:00 (UT).  The infra-red source reported by
Cucchiara et al. (GCN 9286) is detected, but has faded significantly
to K=20.0 +/- 0.2 mag.  We thus confirm that this source is the
afterglow of the burst.
