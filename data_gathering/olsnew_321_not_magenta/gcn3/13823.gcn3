TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13823
SUBJECT: GRB 120923A: JHK Observation
DATE:    12/09/28 06:48:44 GMT
FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

M. Im (CEOU/SNU), H.-I. Sung (KASI), and Y. Urata (NCU)
on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the field of GRB 120923A (Yershov et al. GCN 13796)
in JHK using KASINICS on the 1.8m telescope at the Bohyunsan
observatory in Korea.

The observation started at 2012-09-29 11:30:43 UT,
or about 6.25 hours after the BAT alert.
The stacked JHK images do not reveal a convincing detection
of the afterglow reported earlier (Levan et al. GCN 13802),
to the limits of ~20 AB mag in H and K (3-sigma).
