TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2983
SUBJECT: GRB 050124: NIR afterglow confirmed with Keck/NIRC
DATE:    05/01/26 11:52:36 GMT
FROM:    Edo Berger at Carnegie Obs  <eberger@ociw.edu>

E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We re-observed the 8-arcsec XRT error circle (GCN 2975) of GRB 050124
(GCN2972) with Keck/NIRC on January 26.47 UT.  A total of 18 min were
obtained in the Ks band.  We find that object C1 in our previous Keck/NIRC
image (GCN 2978) has faded by about 0.5 mag, while object C2 remained
constant in flux.  We therefore conclude that C1 is the afterglow of GRB
050124."
