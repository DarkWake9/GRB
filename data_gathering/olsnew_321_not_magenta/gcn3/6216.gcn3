A.O. Jaunsen (Univ. Oslo), J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), M.I. Andersen
(AIP) and P. Vreeswijk (ESO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration.

We observed the field of GRB 070318 (Cummings et al., GCN 6210, La
Parola et al, GCN 6214 and Page et al. GCN 6215) with the ESO/VLT UT2
equipped with FORS1. Observations started on 2007 Mar 19.008 UT and
an 1800-s spectra was acquired with the 300V grism covering a
wavelength range of 3500-8500A.

We identify several absorption lines from MgII, MgI, FeII, MnII of which
the MgII doublet 2796,2804 is the most prominent at a redshift of
z=0.836.

We thank the excellent support from the ESO/Paranal staff.

[GCN OPS NOTE(19mar07): Per author's request, the phrase "several emission
lines" was changed to "several absorption lines" and "MI" was changed
to "Mg I".]
[GCN OPS NOTE(23may08): This time I actually changed the text!]
