The field of the LVC candidate event G296853 was observed with TCH 
(TAROT-Chile field 1.9 x 1.9 deg2), TCA (TAROT Calern, field 1.9 x 
1.9deg2) and TRE (TAROT La RÃ©union field 4.0 x 4.0 deg2) from Aug. 9, 
2017 at 10h10m11s UT to Aug. 11, 2017, at 1h52m39s under good to 
variable conditions. 122 images lasting 120s each where generated. 
Fields observed at least twice have been checked for new sources with an 
upper limit of R > 17.5. For the other fields the analysis is still in 
progress.
