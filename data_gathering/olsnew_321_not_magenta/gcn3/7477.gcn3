J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P.R. Wozniak, H. Davis
of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

Our RAPTOR telescopes responded to Swift trigger 306778
(Pagani et al., GCN 7442) at 12:26:30.66 UTC, 33.70 seconds
after the trigger.  We detect the optical counterpart
initially reported by Li (GCN 7441).  Our measurements are
consistent with those reported by KAIT (GCN 7441 and 7475)
and Super-LOTIS (7443).  Our images became dominated by the
morning twilight at about 12:35 UTC.  The unfiltered
measurements reported in the following table are calibrated
to the USNO-B1 R band.
