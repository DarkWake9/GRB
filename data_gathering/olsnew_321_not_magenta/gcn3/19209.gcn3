and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 160310A was detected by Konus-Wind (Frederiks et 
al., GCN Circ. 19167), Fermi (LAT: Vianello et al., GCN Circ. 19158  and 
GBM: Toelge & Hui GCN Circ. 19167), and Swift (BAT), at about 1378 s UT 
(00:22:58). The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=178.455 deg (11h 53m 49s)  Dec(2000)=-2.131 deg (-2d 07' 52"), 
whose radius is 76.571 +/- 0.876 deg (3 sigma) and to a Konus-BAT 
annulus centered at RA(2000)=178.592 deg (11h 54m 22s)  Dec(2000)=-2.265 
deg (-2d 15' 53"), whose radius is 76.187 +/- 1.716 deg (3 sigma).

While the GBM position is in a good agreement with both the Konus-GBM 
and the Konus-BAT annuli, the LAT position reported in GCN 19158 is 2.9 
deg (~10 sigma) from the Konus-GBM annulus center line. So we encourage 
further investigation of the LAT position.

Using the method suggested by Pal'shin, et al., ApJS 207, 38, 2013 (sec. 
4.2.1) and assuming a LAT error radius of 6 deg, we obtain the following 
joint LAT/IPN error box:
--------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg    Dec(2000), deg
--------------------------------
Center:
    101.726         -7.1445
Corners:
    100.850         -13.082
    102.648         -13.076
    102.726         -1.228
    100.975         -1.191
---------------------------------
The error box area is 21 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 12 deg (the minimum one is 1.8 deg).
