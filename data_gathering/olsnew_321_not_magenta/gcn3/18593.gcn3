Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 151112A (trigger #663179)
(Malesani, et al., GCN Circ. 18588).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 2.050, -61.680 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  00h 08m 11.9s
    Dec(J2000) = -61d 40' 46.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 52%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks, starting with a 
sharp rise peaking at T=0 sec, then a second peak at T+5 sec, a third at T+10 
sec and falling to background by T+20 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 19.32 +- 31.24 
sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.06 to T+61.94 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.77 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.4 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 
1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
