S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 5 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 20:52:17  UT of March 12, 2021

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  155.8431 deg
DEC.=  +76.8714 deg
with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 1.5 ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 2e-7
erg/cm2

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
