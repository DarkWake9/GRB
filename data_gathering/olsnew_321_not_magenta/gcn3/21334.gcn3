and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170702A (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS detection
time on 23:41:33 UT; Swift-BAT detection at the outside of
the field of view) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 23:41:35.21 on 2 July 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all
CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert
processing script, the GCN notice was not distributed
automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows four peaks.  The emission
starts at T-1 sec, peaks at T+0.5 sec (the first peak), T+2 sec
(the second peak), T+4 sec (the third peak), T+8.3 sec (the fourth
peak) and ends at T+10 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 7.5 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
