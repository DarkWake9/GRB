(NASA/GSFC/UMCP) report on behalf of the Swift team:

The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory UVOT and XRT instruments began pointed
galaxy-targeted followup of the LIGO/Virgo detected S190425z (LVC GCN. 24168)
at 2019-04-25 12:53 UT (T0+274 min), delayed due to a commanding gap.
The observations continued until 2019-04-26 20:15 UT, when they were aborted
to begin followup of S190426c (LVC GCN. 24237).

The completed campaign comprised ~400 fields, covering several hundred
of the most massive galaxies in the localization volume.

The Swift UVOT and XRT began pointed galaxy-targeted followup of the
LIGO/Virgo detected S190426c (LVC GCN. 24237) at 2019-04-26 17:45:00
UT (T0+142 min) and continued until T0+~48 hours.

The completed campaign comprised ~800 fields, covering >30% of the
galaxy-convolved localization region of the 'LALInference1' skymap.

The GW rapid followup observations have a nominal 80 s duration, and
are performed primarily with the u filter and with XRT in PC mode. The
average limiting magnitude achieved is ~18.6 in u, and  ~5 x 10^-12
erg s^-1 cm^-2 in soft X-rays (0.3-10 keV).

Analysis of the data is ongoing, and candidate counterparts will be
reported as found.

A list of observed fields, times, and associated target IDs can be found at
the following URL for these triggers and for all future GW followup:

We remind the community that all Swift data are public, and encourage their use.
