report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Following the detection of GRB 100805A by Swift (Hoversten et al.  
GCNC 11047) we carried out I-band observations with the 1.23m  
telescope at Observatory of  Calar Alto. The first exposure started on  
Aug 5.1824 UT (~10 minutes post burst) with an integration time of  
120s. The optical afterglow is well detected with a preliminary  
magnitude of I ~ 16.9, against USNO-B1.0 field stars."
