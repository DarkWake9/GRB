After several more downlinks, the complete data set has arrived for
BAT GRB 061217 (trigger #251634) (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 5926 and
Parsons, et al,, GCN Circ 5930).  Spanning T-120 to T+180 sec,
there is no evidence for pre-trigger activity or post-trigger activity.

The spectral lag for this burst is  -7 +- 9 msec (25-50 keV to 100-350 keV)
using 8-msec binning.  This is consistent with "zero lag" for
short hard bursts.
