Roberts, R. Malina (Center for EUVE Astrophysics, Berkeley), M. Feroci,
L. Piro (Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale / CNR Roma), K. Hurley (Space
Sciences Laboratory, University of Berkeley), communicates: EUVE observed
the position of the X-ray counterpart of GRB 971214 between December
15.8, and December 16.16 UT.  No source was detected during the 2000
second observation made with the Lexan (100 A) filter.  The 3 sigma upper
limit to the count rate us 0.002 c/s.  Assuming an hydrogen column density
of 10^20 cm^2 this converts to an upper limit to the flux of about 1.7 x
10^-13 erg/cm^2/s.
