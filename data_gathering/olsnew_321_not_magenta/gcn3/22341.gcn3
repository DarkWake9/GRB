Insight-HXMT team:

At 2018-01-11T16:42:06 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 180111A (trigger ID: HEB180111695) in a routine search of the 
data,which is also triggered by Swift/BAT (Lien et al.,GCN 
22318),AGILE/MCAL(Verrecchia et al.,GCN 22321),and CALET(Asaoka et 
al.,GCN 22333).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of 
multi-pulses with a duration (T90) of 19.94 s measured from T0+0.185 s. 
The 500-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.422 s, is 2332.29 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 13972.02 counts. URL_LC:

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the GRB mode, in 
which the energy range is increased to about 200 - 3000 keV (record 
energy), compared to the normal mode of 80 - 800 keV. Only gamma-rays 
with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the spacecraft and 
leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside of the telescope. 

The analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will 
be published elsewhere. Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray 
telescope, which was funded jointly by the China National Space 
Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). More
