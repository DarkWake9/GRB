Swift trigger 574266 (Beardmore et al., GCN 15323), was also observed by
MESSENGER GRNS, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.  We have triangulated it
to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area is ~40000 sq. arcmin., and
whose coordinates are:

CENTER:
   RA(2000)                        DEC(2000)  
113.600 deg. = 7 h 34 m 24 s     80.277 deg. = 80 o 16 ' 38"
CORNERS:
119.660 deg. = 7 h 58 m 38 s     72.631 deg. = 72 o 37 '  51 "
 56.573 deg. = 3 h 46 m 17 s     87.670 deg. = 87 o 40 '  13 "
118.606 deg. = 7 h 54 m 25 s     70.117 deg. = 70 o  7 '  01 "
 81.813 deg. = 5 h 27 m 15 s     86.290 deg. = 86 o 17 '  23 "

This error box is also consistent with the Konus ecliptic latitude
determination.  It lies approximately 80 degrees from the Swift BAT
localization (GCN 15323), confirming that Swift trigger 574266 was
indeed a GRB ~68 degrees from the center of the BAT field of view, and
unrelated to VY Ari.  Improvements in the IPN localization are possible.
