MASTER-IAC  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, 2x4 
square degrees) located in IAC was pointed to the  LIGO/Virgo G211117 event 
(Possible Gravitational Wave Burst)  7975 sec after notice time and
1 days 58376 sec after trigger time at 2015-12-27 19:51:49 UT. Our first 
(180s exposure)  set we have 5-sigma upper limit has been about 20.0 mag 
(unfiltered).

MASTER-SAAO  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in SAAO was pointed to the LIGO/Virgo G211117 event 19726 sec 
after notice time and 1 days 70127 sec after trigger time at 2015-12-27 23:07:40 UT. On 
our first (180s exposure)  set we haven`t found optical transient  within 
LIGO error-box (ra=02 31 59 dec=+07 59 59 r=0.100000).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 20.2mag (unfiltered).
The message may be cited.


MASTER-Kislovodsk  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru) located in SAAO was pointed to the  LIGO/Virgo 
G211117 event
9608 sec after notice time and 1 days 60009 sec after trigger time at 
2015-12-27 20:19:02 UT. On our first (180s exposure)  set we have
5-sigma upper about 15.3mag (unfiltered).

The full Coverage map  starting after trigger (47.5 % total probability 
- north + south segment) is  available here:
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/G211117_MASTER_NET.png
This map includes both independently MASTER survey of the alert area on 
26th after , and Inspect images after the notice time (2015-12-27 17:38)

Four MASTER VWF  (very wide field FOV = 2 x 386 sq. degree, d=82 mm f/1.2) 
cameras at Kislovodsk and Canary Island cover 4.3 % of total probability 
field synchronously with Ligo trigger at 2015-12-26 03:38:53 UTC.
I.e we have  a set of 5 seconds images before, during and after trigger 
without time gaps.

The 3 sigma upper limit is about 11 mag at a single (5 seconds) image and 
12 mag at a coadd of 12 images with total exposure 60 sec.

We detected second OT during inspection.

MASTER OT J124246.31+111448.6 - possible QSO in active state not relaited 
with gravitational wave event.

MASTER-IAC auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 12h 
42m 46.31s +11d 14m 48.6s on 2015-12-28.28271 UT (error box  1 arcsec).
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 18.9m (limit 19.5m).

The OT is seen in 3 images. There is no minor planet at this place.

We have reference image without OT on 2015-12-28.25404 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 20.0 m.
There is possible QSO  SDSS 124246.25+111449.0 inside our error box.
We have long story of the avout 2 magnitude variability this sources in 
Tunka nad Kislovodsk  MASTERs DataBase.

The reduction is continuated.
