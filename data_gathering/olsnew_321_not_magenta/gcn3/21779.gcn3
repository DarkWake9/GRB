L. P. Singer (NASA/GSFC), R. Lau (Caltech), and M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech)
report on behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients
Happen (GROWTH) collaboration:

We report continued near-infrared observations in J, H, Ks band on the
FLAMINGOS-2 instrument on Gemini-South through 2017-08-31 UT. The source
seems to have ceased fading between 2017-08-28 UT and 2017-08-29 UT and
reached a plateau at about Ks = 17.7 mag (Vega).
