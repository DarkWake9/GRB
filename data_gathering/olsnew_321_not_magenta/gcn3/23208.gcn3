Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, J. C. Tello, A. Ayala and A. J. 
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), I. Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de 
Malaga), M. D. Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ) and R. Querel (NIWA), on 
behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) automatically responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 180905A 
(D'Elia et al. GCNC 23201) ~0.55 h after the burst as soon as it became 
few degrees above the horizon. The first image (clear filter) were 
obtained starting at 14:30:52 UT. At the position of the Swift/XRT 
enhanced X-ray position (Beardmore et al. GCNC 23207), no optical 
afterglow is detected down to 20 mag on a 720s co-added image at 
14:38:31 (mid-exposure), in agreement with the non-detection by 
Swift/UVOT.
Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
