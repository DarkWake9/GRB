report on behalf of the GROND team:


We observed the field of GRB 080516 (Holland et al.  2008, GCN 7733)
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK using the multi-channel imager GROND
(Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope
on La Silla (Chile). Observations started at 00:25 UT, 8 min after the
burst.

At the border of the revised XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 7735)
we detect in all bands a faint source at

RA, DEC (J2000) = 08:02:33.96, -26:09:33.6  (+/- 0.5")

with r'= 23.92 +/- 0.2 at ~1 hr after the burst, calibrated against NOMAD
field stars. This source is very close to a brighter foreground point
source and close to a very bright star (Cobb et al., GCN 7738). 

Note that due to visibility constraints observations could only be
performed for two hours. Problems with the photometry did not allow us to
report these results earlier.
