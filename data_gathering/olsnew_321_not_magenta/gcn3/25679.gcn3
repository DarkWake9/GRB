The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:25:09 UT on 6 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190906B (trigger 589487114.28841 / 190906767).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 171.8, Dec = -71.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 27m, -71d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
