D. W. Fox, R. Burruss, E. Berger, J. S. Bloom, S. G. Djorgovski, and
S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech), with M. Haynes (Cornell), report on behalf
of the larger Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"R. Burrus obtained Sloan r' images of the joint HETE/IPN localization
for GRB010921 (HETE trigger #1761; GCNs #1096 and #1097) with the Hale
200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory beginning 22 hours after the
trigger (22 September 03:18 UT).  The instrument used was the Large
Format Camera (LFC) and the observations were 4 min in duration (3
pointings). Visual comparison with the Digital Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey F plate reveals no obvious new source to the depth of the DPOSS
image (R ~ 20.5 mag)."
