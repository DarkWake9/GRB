report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080413B detected by Swift/BAT (trigger 309111,
Stamatikos et al. 2008, GCN Circ. 7598) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK 
with GROND mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory 
(Chile). Observations started at 08:56 UT on April 13th, 2008, 5 min after
the burst.

We detect a new bright point source at

RA (J2000.0) = 21:44:34.67
DEC (J2000.0) = -19:58:52.4

with an uncertainty of 0.5", which is consistent with the UVOT
position.

The object is detected in all seven bands, implying a redshift
smaller than 3.5.

Preliminary photometry of the first 4 min exposure yields an J band 
magnitude of 16.5 calibrated against 2MASS field stars.
The given magnitude is not corrected for the Galactic foreground
reddening of E(B-V)=0.04 mag (Schlegel et al., 1998).
