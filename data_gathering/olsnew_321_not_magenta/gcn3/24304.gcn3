G. Waratkar, H. Kumar, V. Bhalerao (IITB), J. Stanzin, G. C. Anupama (IIA) report on behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration:

We imaged the location of the Swift/UVOT transient candidate (Breeveld et al., GCN 24296) for the counterpart of LIGO/Virgo S190425z with the 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. We obtained a 600s g band image starting at UT 2019-04-27T20:07:44, and a 600s r band image starting at UT 2019-04-27T19:42:49. The source was not detected in either of the images, down to a limiting magnitude of 21.0.
