On behalf of the DESGW team*:

We report 3 new candidate counterparts to the LIGO/Virgo  black hole/neutron star merger S190814bv (reported by the LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration in GCN Circular No. 25324, updated GCN Circular No. 25333) found by our target of opportunity program (PI: Soares-Santos, PropID: 2019B-0372), and provide additional photometry on one candidate discovered by GROWTH (PIs: Andreoni & Goldstein, GCN No. 25362).

The region was imaged by DECam, on the CTIO Blanco Telescope. First and second epochs were obtained on the nights of 2019 Aug 16 (GCN Circular No. 25336) and Aug 17, at 9.5h and 33h post merger (GCN No. 25360). We observed through clouds and full moon on both nights. Depth achieved is 20.5 mag (10 sigma point source) in i and z bands.

Images were processed by our difference imaging pipeline (Herner et al. 2017; see also Soares-Santos et al. 2015, 2017; Doctor et al. 2018; Morgan et al. 2019 for recent applications) using DES images as templates. We employ a machine learning code (autoscan, Goldstein et al. 2015) to reject subtraction artifacts. Candidates were initially selected by requiring at least two high signal to noise detections, rejecting asteroids. We then applied catalog-based vetting to reject variable stars, variable AGNs, using various catalogs including GAIA DR2, and candidates with hosts at redshifts inconsistent (>2sigma, H0=70) with the distance reported by the LVC for S190814bv (276 +/- 56 Mpc) using a variety of photometric and spectroscopic catalogs including DES. The final vetting was done via visual inspection. We matched our remaining candidates using the Transient Name Server to avoid reporting those previously reported by other groups, and the Minor Planet Center to further filter against slow moving asteroids. The following candidates pass our selection criteria:

We also detect four (DG19frdgc, DG19tzyhc, DG19prsgc, DG19qabkc) of the candidates previously reported by GROWTH (Goldstein et al., GCN 25362). One of them met our selection criteria: DG19qabkc. We provide additional photometry for their remaining candidate:

All magnitudes reported are observed magnitudes. We encourage spectroscopic followup of these candidates.

The DECam Search & Discovery Program for Optical Signatures of Gravitational Wave Events (DESGW) is carried out by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration in partnership with wide ranging groups in the community. DESGW uses data obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), which was constructed by the DES collaboration with support from the Department of Energy and member institutions, and utilizes data as distributed by the Science Data Archive at NOAO. NOAO is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
