N.Paul M. Kuin (MSSL/UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift-UVOT Team:

In GCN Circ. 23241 the position of the transient was correct in sexadecimal
units, but
incorrect in the degree units, where it should read:

The UVOT source position is RA= 332.35638, Dec =  25.06217 (J2000).

My apologies for any confusion caused by this mistake.
