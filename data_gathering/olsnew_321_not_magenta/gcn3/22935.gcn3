J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.) reports:

I observed the field of Swift GRB 180709A (Marshall et al., GCN 22930)
with an SDSS r filter using the 1.3m McGraw Hill telescope of the
MDM Observatory, beginning 17.6 minutes after the trigger.
Four 5-minute exposures were obtained in morning twilight.
Upper limits at the enhanced Swift-XRT position of Beardmore et al.
(GCN 22933) are listed below, as calibrated to Pan-STARRS1 photometry.

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction, which is
considerable at this Galactic latitude of -0.1 deg.  According to the
NED implementation of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011), A_r = 6.1 mag.
