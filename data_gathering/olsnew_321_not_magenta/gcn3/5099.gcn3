P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii), T. Minezaki (IoA, Tokyo), L.L. Cowie, Y.
Kakazu (IfA, Hawaii) and Y. Yoshii (IoA, Tokyo) report:

We have observed the XRT localisation of GRB 060510b (GCN #5096) with
the robotic MAGNUM telescope + MIPS dual-beam imager in the J band.  Our
observations consisted of 10 x 30 sec exposures commencing 2006 May
10.374 UTC.  We do not detect any afterglow candidate at the XRT
position, or at the faint optical afterglow candidate position of
Mirabal & Halpern (GCN #5098), to an estimated limiting magnitude of J ~
19.0 mag (based on comparison with the 2MASS catalogue star at
239.065708,78.573784 with J = 12.9 mag).
