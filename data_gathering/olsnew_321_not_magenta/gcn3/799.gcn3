TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  799
SUBJECT: GRB000911: Corrected coordinates
DATE:    00/09/27 18:02:18 GMT
FROM:    Paul Price at RSAA, ANU at CIT  <pap@srl.caltech.edu>

P. Price reports:

"A typographical error in the coordinates of the candidate in GCN #796 has
been brought to my attention.  The correct coordinates are:
(RA200, Dec2000) = (02:18:34.36, +07:44:27.7), consistent with the position
of the radio candidate (GCN #795)."
