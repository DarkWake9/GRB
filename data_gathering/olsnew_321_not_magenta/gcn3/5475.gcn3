P. D'Avanzo, S. Covino (INAF-OABrera), L. A. Antonelli (INAF-OAR) on
behalf of a larger collaboration, A. Magazzu` and G. Tessicini (INAF-TNG)
report:

We observed the field of GRB 060825 (Sato et al., GCN 5471) with the
italian 3.6m TNG telescope, sited in Canary Island, Spain. A set of BVRI
images have been collected, with a seeing of 1.3". The mean epoch of
observations is Aug 25.22 UT. We clearly see the DSS object reported by
de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 5472) and Cenko et al. (GCN 5473). 

No new object is seen inside the XRT error box , to a limiting magnitude
of R > 23.9 (3sigma level).

We thank TNG staff for their support.
