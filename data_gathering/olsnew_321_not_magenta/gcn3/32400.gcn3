R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Swift GRB 220714B (Laha et al., GCN 32393) field with the LCO 1-meter Sinistro instrument at the South African Astronomical Observatory site, on July 15, from 02:32 to 02:59 UT (corresponding to 13.57 to 14.02 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS r and i filters.

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in i and r bands.  We detect an optical counterpart at the same position as the UVOT afterglow (Marshall et al., GCN 32396) in both bands.

The following magnitudes are calculated using the PanSTARRS catalog as reference:

r = 19.77 +/- 0.07
i = 19.44 +/- 0.07

These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682
