Using the data set from T-240 to T+480 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080707 (trigger #316204) 
(Schady et al., GCN Circ. 7947).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 32.627, 33.100 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  02h 10m 30.5s
    Dec(J2000) = +33d 06' 01.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 93%.

The mask-weighted light curve consists of two main peaks of roughly 
equivalent peak flux, the first a boxcar shape from T-2 to T+4 sec, and 
the second a FRED beginning at T+23 sec and decaying to background by 
T+32 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 27.1 +- 1.1 sec sec (estimated error 
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.8 to T+26.6 sec is best fit by a 
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.77 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
5.2 +- 0.6 x 10^-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T+0.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
