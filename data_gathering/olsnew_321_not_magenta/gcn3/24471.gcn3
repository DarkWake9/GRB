The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:14:24 UT on 11 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190511A (trigger 579251669.35821 / 190511302).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 123.8, Dec = -24.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 15m, -24d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
