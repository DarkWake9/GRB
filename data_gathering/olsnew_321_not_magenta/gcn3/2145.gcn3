report:

A part of the results of the UBVRcIc observations with the 1-m (Zeiss-1000) of
SAO RAS at two epochs on March, 29 and the next two nights are now presented
at our anonymous FTP-site:
          ftp://ftp.sao.ru/pub2/grb/GRB030329/

One can see the evolution of the early broad-band UBVRI spectra. In
addition, comparison with the MPFS spectra (see GCN #2142) allows us to 
perform more precise flux calibration of these spectral data.

Sorry! More correct reference quoted in  GCN #2142 is E. Grassberg, 
V. Imshennik and D. Nadyozhin, 1971, Astroph. Space Sci., 10, 28
