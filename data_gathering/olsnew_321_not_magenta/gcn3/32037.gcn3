The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2022-05-13 at 23:23:12.61 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the  ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Gold alert stream. The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 0.942 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136627_61640402.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2022-05-13
Time:  23:23:12.61 UT
RA: 224.03 deg (+1.36, -1.27 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -1.34 deg (+0.74, -0.81 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no known gamma-ray sources in the 90% containment region for the event. The nearest source in the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi-LAT catalog is 4FGL J1445.0-0326 (221.27 deg, -3.45 deg J2000, 3.47 deg away from the best-fit neutrino candidate position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
