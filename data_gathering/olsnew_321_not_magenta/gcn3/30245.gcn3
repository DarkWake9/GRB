N. Pankov (IKI, HSE), A. Pozanenko (IKI), V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), S. 
Belkin (IKI, HSE)  report on behalf of IKI GRB FuN:

We observed the GRB 210610B (Page  et al., GCN 30170) with ZTSH 2.6m
telescope of CrAO observatory on June 10,11  (Rumyantsev et al., GCNs 
30175, 30178; Pankov et al., GCN 30213) and June 12 - 14.  The optical 
afterglow  first reported by UVOT (Page  et al., GCN 30170) is clearly 
detected in each epochs. Some preliminary photometry is following.

The photometry is based on calibrations stars reported in (Pankov et
al., GCN 30213).

Based on our observations in ZTSh on June 10-14, AbAO (Pankov et al., 
GCN 30243) and photometry reported in GCNs we report the light curve of 
the afterglow which can be found in

After plateau phase lasting up to ~ 0.3 days in R-filter, the LC can be 
approximated by a single power law with index of -1.6.
