report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:49:35.08 UT on 30 June 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200630A (trigger 615174580 / 200630076)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Page et al. 2020, GCN 28043)
and the Swift/XRT (Beardmore et al. 2020, GCN 28044).
The Fermi GBM Final Position is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 42
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows one main peak
with a duration (T90) of about 7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.5 s to T0+3.56 s is
best fit by a single power law function with index of -1.51 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.41 +/- 0.12)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.19 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.9 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
