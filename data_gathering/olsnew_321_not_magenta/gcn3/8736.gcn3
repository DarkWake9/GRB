E. Berger, A. M. Soderberg (Harvard), A. Cucchiara, and D. B. Fox (Penn
State) report:

"We re-observed the error circle of GRB 081226 (GCN 8729) with GMOS on the
Gemini-South telescope on 2008 Dec 26.349 UT (7.31 hours post burst).  A
comparison to our first epoch of imaging, taken on 2008 Dec 26.112 UT
(1.62 hours post burst; GCN 8732), reveals that neither of the two objects
within the XRT error circle (GCN 8732) have varied in brightness.  This
is confirmed using digital image subtraction with the ISIS package."
