A. Henden (AAVSO), J. Gross (SRO), B. Denny (DC-3), D. Terrell (SwRI), and
W. Cooney (SRO) report:

We obtained imagery of the GRB 100305A burst reported by Troja et al.
(GCN 10470) using the Sonoita Research Observatory (SRO) 35cm telescope
in southern Arizona, utilizing an automatic VOevent trigger.  The
exposures began about 3 minutes after the burst and continued
for approximately two hours.  20 Rc-band, 10 V-band, and a set of
BVRI exposures for field calibration were acquired.
Inspection of the enhanced Swift-XRT position given by Osborne, et al.
(GCN 10474) does not show any optical afterglow to the following limits,
based on using star USNOB 1323-0268523 at 11:13:38.45 +42:23:45.7
as having magnitudes R=15.98 and V=16.67):
