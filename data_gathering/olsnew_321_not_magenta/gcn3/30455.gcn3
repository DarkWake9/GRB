Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, T.-R. Sun, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M. D. Caballero-Garcia, M. A. Castro Tirado (IAA-CSIC), I. Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New Zealand) automatically responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 210712A (Sbarufatti et al. GCNC 30447). Images were taken starting at 15:01 UT, but due to poor weather conditions, only images taken after 17:32 UT (~7.8 hrs after trigger) could be used. In the co-added image (30 exposures 60s each), no source is found at the position reported by Swift/XRT (Evans et al. GCNC 30453) down to 19.6 mag which is consistent with the non-detection by Swift/UVOT (Sbarufatti et al. GCNC 30447). Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
