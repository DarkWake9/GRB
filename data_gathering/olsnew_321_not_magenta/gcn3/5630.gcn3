K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of GRB 060927 (Barbier et al. GCN 5627) was observed
with the 14 inch ART-3a and 0.35m ART-3b in Toyonaka, Osaka.

 Preliminary analysis of the ART-3a data confirms the presence of a
fading source at the position consistent with that reported by
Schaefer et al. (GCN 5629).
