TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  19000
SUBJECT: GRB 160206A: Swift/UVOT observations
DATE:    16/02/07 20:04:48 GMT
FROM:    Massimiliano de Pasquale at IASF-Palermo  <m.depasquale@ucl.ac.uk>

M. De Pasquale (PSU) and A. Melandri (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of MAXI-detected GRB
160206A (Furuya et al., GCN Circ. 18993) 46.2 ks after the trigger.

No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT source 2 given by Page
et al. (GCN Circ. 18996) is detected in the UVOT exposures.

Preliminary 3-sigma upper limit using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the summed UVOT
exposures is:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)    3sigma UL Mag

u                48081        52769         909           21


Source 1 is found to be consistent with the magnitude 12.3 object
TyC 7149 2271-1.

These magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.47 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).

[GCN OPS NOTE(08feb16): Per author's request, "XRT source 1"
was changed to "XRT source 2", and "Source 2 is" was changed
to "Source 1 is".]
