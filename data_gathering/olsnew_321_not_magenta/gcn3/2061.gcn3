K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

GRB 030331 was detected by Konus-Wind at 05:38:40.824 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 05:38:44.347 UT.
As observed by Konus-Wind, it had a 15-2000 keV fluence of
approximately  2.7E-5 erg/cm2 in 25 s, and a peak flux of
5.5E-6 erg/cm2 s over 0.128s.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 27.250 deg,
Decl(2000) = 13.733 deg,
Radius = 40.7 +/- 1.1 degrees (3 sigma ).
This annulus intersects the IPN annulus (GCN 2057) to form two
large error boxes, only one of which is in the correct ecliptic
latitude band.
Preliminary 3 sigma error box has approximate area of 400 sq.
arcmin :

			RA(2000)	Dec(2000)
ERROR BOX CENTER:	349.261		36.260
ERROR BOX CORNER 1:	347.872		36.429
ERROR BOX CORNER 2:	347.852		36.389
ERROR BOX CORNER 3:	350.666		36.089
ERROR BOX CORNER 4:	350.643		36.049
