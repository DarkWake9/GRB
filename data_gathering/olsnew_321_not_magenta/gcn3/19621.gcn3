D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), E.Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, 
L.Pavan (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 100 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 22:19:30 UT of 2016 June 29.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=   4.7618  deg
DEC.=  76.9468 deg

with an uncertainty of  2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 2.6 ph/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 6.e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
