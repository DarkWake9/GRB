S. B. Cenko, E. O. Ofek, and M. Kasliwal (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have re-imaged the field of GRB061028 (Sakamoto et al, GCN 5762) with
the Large Format Camera mounted on the 200" Palomar Hale telescope.
Observations consisted of 2 x 180 s images in r' and i' taken at a mean
epoch of approximately 29 Oct. 12:45 UT (~ 35.3 hr after the burst).

We find no evidence for variability in either afterglow candidate S1
(Bloom et al, GCN 5768) or S2 (Cenko et al, GCN 5770).  Given the constant
flux level from ~ 5 hr (Mirabal et al, GCN 5771) to ~ 35 hr after the
burst, we consider both highly unikely to be related to the afterglow of
GRB061028.
