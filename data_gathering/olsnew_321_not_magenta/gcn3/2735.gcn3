report:

The HETE Fregate and WXM instruments detected GRB 040924 (=H3564) at 
11:52:11 UT (42731 SOD) on 24 September 2004.  The WXM flight software 
localized the burst in real time, resulting in a GCN Notice 14 seconds 
after the burst trigger.  The flight error region was a circle of 
14 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

  RA = 02h 06m 40s, DEC = +16d 08' 10" (J2000).

Ground analyses of the burst data allow the error region to be refined
to a circle of 6.4 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

  RA = 02h 06m 19s, DEC = +16d 01' 26" (J2000).

The burst is short, although not particularly hard:  the burst durations, 
as measured by T50, are 1.2s, 1.0s, and 0.6s in the 7-30 keV, 7-80 keV,
and 30-400 keV bands, respectively.  Preliminary spectral analyses show 
GRB 040924 to have an Epeak of 42 +/- 6 keV.  The 7-30 keV fluence is 
1.6e-6 erg/cm2, and the 30-400 keV fluence is 2.6e-6 erg/cm2:  the fluence 
ratio is 0.6, allowing us to classify GRB 040924 as an X-ray rich GRB.  
The empirical redshift indicator ("pseudo-z"; Atteia 2003) for GRB 040924
is 0.5.
