The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:30:55 UT on 28 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190628A (trigger 583417860.320222 / 190628521).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 144.1, Dec = -77.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 36m, -77d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 120.0 degrees.
