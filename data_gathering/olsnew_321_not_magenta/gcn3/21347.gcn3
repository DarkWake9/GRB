Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170714A (trigger #762535)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 21340).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 34.322, 1.962 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 17m 17.3s
  Dec(J2000) = +01d 57' 43.3"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 61%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows continuous weak emission that starts
at ~ T-70 s and lasts beyond the end of the event data (T+963 s).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-72.9 to T+464.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.76 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+262.88 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
