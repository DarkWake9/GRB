We observed the field of GRB 150811A (Evans, et al., GCN 18119) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/08 14.22 to 2015/08 14.41 UTC (73.12 to
77.68 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.56 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

  r = 22.4 +/- 0.3
  i = 22.0 +/- 0.4
  z > 20.37

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The fading of the source remains
consistent with t^(-1) (see, Butler et al., 18120, 18132, 18140).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
