P. Reig (U. of Crete/FORTH) & G.V. Panopoulou (Caltech) reporting on behalf 
of the RoboPol collaboration: 

We observed the optical transient OTJ033744.97+723159.0 (Lipunov et al. GCN 21720, 
GCN 21736), on 2017-08-29.07UT  with the RoboPol polarimeter at the Skinakas observatory 
1.3-m telescope. Preliminary analysis shows that the R-band fractional polarization of 
the source is 1.8+-0.47%. It is consistent with polarization of nearby field stars. 
Further observations are scheduled.
