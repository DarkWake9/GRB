G. Hallinan (Caltech), A. Corsi (TTU), K. Mooley (Hintze Fellow, 
Oxford), D.A. Frail (NRAO), M.M. Kasliwal (Caltech), report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration:

Our collaboration (GROWTH, JAGWAR, Caltech-NRAO, TTU-NRAO) has continued 
to monitor the evolution of the radio counterpart to GW170817/SSS17a 
discovered on September 2,3, 2017 with the Jansky VLA (Mooley et al. LVC 
GCN 21814 and Corsi et al. LVC GCN 21815), with ongoing observations at 
frequencies of 1.4 GHz, 3 GHz and 6 GHz. Responding to a request for 
further information to help plan observations at other radio facilities, 
we are including details on the most recent detection at 3 GHz, wherein 
the source was detected at a flux density of 34 +/- 3.6 uJy on Sept 17 
(UT). The full light curves and interpretation have been submitted for 
publication (Hallinan, Corsi et al.).

We thank the VLA staff for scheduling these observations.
