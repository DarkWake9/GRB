report:

The 30cm FRAM telescope, located at Pierre Auger
observatory in Malargue, Argentina, followed the GRB
120913B (Helder et al. GCNC13763, Swift trigger
#533613). Observations started 24.4s after the GRB
trigger.

10s R-band (lambda_eff = 640nm) images with a limit of
~16.0 were obtained. We identify the optical transient
reported by LaCluyze et al. (GCNC13764) and Klotz et
al. (GCNC13765) with a magnitude R = 16.3 +/- 0.2 on a
sum of 8x10s images obtained between 271 and 364s after
the GRB.
