W. Rujopakarn (Steward), T. Guver (U Arizona), D.A. Smith (Guilford),
report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe,
Turkey, responded to GRB 080603B (Swift trigger 313087). The first image
was at 19:38:36.2 UT, 22.9 s after the burst (8.3 s after the GCN notice
time). The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We
detect a new, rapidly fading object, not visible in the DSS (second
epoch), with coordinates:

     11:46:07.8      +68:03:39.9    (J2000), with positional uncertainty
of 1" or better
