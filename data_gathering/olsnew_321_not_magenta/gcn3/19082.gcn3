K. Wiersema, N. Tanvir (U. of Leicester),  A. Levan (U. of Warwick)
and G. Pugliese (API/UvA) report:

We observed the position of GRB 160225A (Siegel et al. GCN 19075) with 
the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Using the LIRIS instrument
we obtained 20x60 sec in Y band, 20x60 sec in J band and 60x20 sec in Ks band.
Observations started at 19:57 UT on 25 February 2016 (i.e. 5.62 hours after
burst).
A point source is clearly detected near the enhanced XRT position 
(Goad et al. GCN 19077), at position:
RA (J2000):  10 56 55.18
Dec (J2000): +53 40 13.7
with an uncertainty of 0.5 arc seconds. The source is seen in all three
filters, and has magnitudes J~20.6 mag and Ks~19.2 mag (Vega magnitudes, 
calibrated using 2MASS objects in the field).

We acknowledge excellent support from Raine Karjalainen (ING).
