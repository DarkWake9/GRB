C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-201222A
(GCN 29120), the reported position:

RA:  206.37 (+0.90  -0.80 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 13.44 (+0.55 -0.38 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately
13.8 minutes prior until 19.2 minutes after event time. Therefore,
the GBM observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
