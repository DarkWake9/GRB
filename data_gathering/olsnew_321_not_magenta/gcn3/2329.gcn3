SUBJECT: XRF 030723: confirmation of fading optical counterpart

Howard E. Bond (Space Telescope Science Institute) reports:

As noted in (GCN #2316) the error circle of XRF 030723 was imaged with the
SMARTS Consortium 1.3m reflector at Cerro Tololo on UT 2003 July 24.080,
24.173, and 24.281.  An additional observation was obtained at UT 2003 July
25.414.  R-band exposures of 3x300 sec were taken at each epoch  

The fading of the optical transient reported by Fox et al. (GCN #2323) is
confirmed, albeit at low S/N.  At July 24.080 the source was unfortunately
located on a low-sensitivity region of the CCD.  On July 24.173 and 24.281 it
had R magnitudes of 21.0 and 20.9 (calibrated against a Landolt standard
field, but with uncertainties of at least 0.1 mag).  On July 25.414 the
transient had faded below detectability and was at least 1 mag fainter than on
the previous night.

I thank Rebeccah Winnick, David Gonzalez, and Juan Espinoza for arranging and
executing the observations on very short notice.
