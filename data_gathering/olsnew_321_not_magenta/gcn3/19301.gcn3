Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160412A (trigger #682522)
(Gibson, et al., GCN Circ. 19298).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 33.074, -67.636 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 12m 17.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -67d 38' 08.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curves shows several overlapping peaks starting at
~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+15 sec, and ending at ~T+70 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 31.6 +- 4.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.35 to T+40.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.88 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+14.40 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
