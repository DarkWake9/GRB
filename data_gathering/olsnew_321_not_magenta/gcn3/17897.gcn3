P. A. Evans (U Leicester), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:37:38 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) had lost
star-tracker lock. 

As a result trigger 642296 and subsequent triggers are due to
misidentifying known sources as new GRBs. 

The Flight Operations Team has been called in.
