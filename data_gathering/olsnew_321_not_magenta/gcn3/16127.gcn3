Using the data set from T-240 to T+485 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140419A (trigger #596426)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 16118).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 127.001, 46.234 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 28m 00.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 14' 03.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 33%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two slightly overlapping clusters of
peaks, starting at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+10 and ~T+51 sec, and ending
at ~T+220 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 94.7 +- 11.0 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.69 to T+222.32 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.21 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.59 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+51.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.

[GCN OPS NOTE(22apr14): Per author's request, the fluence value
was changed from "1.6 +- 0.0" to "1.59 +- 0.03". Acknowledgement
to F.Marshall for pointing out the missing error value.]
