on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team report:
   
We have observed the field of GRB 050408 over two nights
with the 1.5m Kuiper telescope on Mt. Bigelow, AZ., USA.
We have performed BVRI broad-band imaging and have detected
a source at a position consistent with that reported by
A. de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 3193).
   
UT      Mag                 Exp(sec)
9.16    R=21.888 +/- 0.150  11x120
9.18    I=21.305 +/- 0.203  9x120
9.20    V=22.069 +/- 0.171  11x120
   
9.26    R=21.963 +/- 0.129  8x300
9.29    I=20.691 +/- 0.132  8x300
9.32    V=22.618 +/- 0.191  7x300
9.35    B=22.369 +/- 0.166  6x300
                                                                                
10.26   I=22.288 +/- 0.390  4x300
10.29   V=23.480 +/- 0.612  4x300
                                                                                
The field was calibrated from Landolt fields observed during
the first night. Two field stars were compared against the
field calibration compiled by Nysewander et al. (GCN 3246).
We were brighter in all cases, by 0.20/0.02/0.16/0.14 magnitudes
for B/V/R/I respectively.
                                                                                
Further observations are planned to obtain images suitable for
use in image subtraction.
