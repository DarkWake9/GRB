The bright, long GRB 13505A (GCN 14563; Cannizzo et al.)
triggered the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an
energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at  UT 08:22:24.527 (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a bright peak followed by a weaker
emission seen up to T0+30 s with a duration (T90) of about 14 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.06 (+0.05/-0.05) x10^-4 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+4 s was
53.1 (+2.0/-2.5) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-2 s to T0+30 s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.
the low-energy photon index alpha: -0.99 (+0.17/-0.11),
the high-energy photon index beta: -2.33 (+0.06/-0.07),
and the peak energy Epeak: 1094 (+131/-175) keV (chi^2/d.o.f = 23.9/23).
Using a redshift of z = 2.27 (Tanvir et al., GCN 14567), we estimate
the isotropic energy release in the 1 keV - 10 MeV range to be
2.55 (+0.12/- 0.11) x10^54 erg and the peak energy at the rest frame
to be 3615 (+532/-469) keV, where cosmological parameters of the Omega
matter, the Omega lambda and the Hubble constant are fixed at 0.27, 0.73
and 70 km/s/Mpc respectively.

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 3% systematic error was added for
low energy channels.
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
