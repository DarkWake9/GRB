We observed the field of GRB 160314A (D'Elia et al., GCN 19182) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/03 16.12 to 2016/03 16.35 UTC (39.43 to
44.80 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.56 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.49 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 19185),
in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
detections and 3-sigma upper limit:

r      23.48 +/- 0.26
i      22.84 +/- 0.16
Z     22.08 +/- 0.17
Y     22.32 +/- 0.22
J      >  22.45
H     21.87 +/- 0.25

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. Our observations (see, also, Butler
et al., GCN 19196) are consistent with a continued, slow source fading as
reported by the GROND team (Schweyer et al, GCN 19200).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
