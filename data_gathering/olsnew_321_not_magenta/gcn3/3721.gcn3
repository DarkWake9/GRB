J-L. Atteia & A. Pelangeon (LAT-OMP) report:

Taking into account the revised value of the fluence of GRB 050525a provided
by Golenetskii et al. in GCN 3660, we have re-computed the pseudo-redshift of
GRB 050525a (using the method described in Atteia, 2003, A&A, 407, L1).

We find a pseudo-redshift pz=0.64 +/- 0.1, in good agreement with the
spectroscopic redshift z=0.606
