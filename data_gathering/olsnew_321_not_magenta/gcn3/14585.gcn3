Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger collaboration:

We observed a filed of the Swift GRB 130505A (Cannizzo  et al. GCN 14563) 
with  0.7m  telescope of Institute of Astronomy, Kharkiv National University 
between  May 05 (UT) 20:52:35 - 21:19:57. A set of images of 180 s were 
taken in R-filter. In the combined image we clearly  detect optical 
afterglow (Cannizzo  et al., GCN 14563; Tanvir et al., GCN 14567; Kuroda et 
al., GCN 14568). Preliminary photometry is based on the nearby SDSS stars:
