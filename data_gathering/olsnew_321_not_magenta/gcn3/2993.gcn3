D. A. Frail (NRAO) and A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We have used the VLA to make observations of the XRT error circle
(GCN #2984) for the Swift burst GRB050126 (GCN #2987). The
observations were carried out on 2005 January 26.67 UT (4 hrs after
the burst) and January 28.59 UT. At a frequency of 8.46 GHz no
emission was detected above 135 microJy (4-5 sigma) within the
30-arcsec diameter error circle. At the position of the NIR afterglow
candidate found by Berger and Kulkarni (GCN #2985) there is no
emission in excess of 30-45 microJy.

No further observations are planned."
