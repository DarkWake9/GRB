report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2021-01-29T21:48:56.900 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 210129A (trigger ID: HEB210129908) in a routine search of the data, 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 3.05 s measured from T0+0.04 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.66 s, is 1733 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 2481 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
