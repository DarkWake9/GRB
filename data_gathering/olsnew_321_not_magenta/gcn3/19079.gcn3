We first observed the field of GRB 160223A (Markwardt, et al., GCN 19057)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/02 23.15 to 2016/02 23.49 UTC
(3.65 to 11.79 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.04
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 2.26 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.  We observed a second time from 2016/02 24.12 to 2016/02 24.49
UTC (26.78 to 35.78 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 5.02
hours exposure in the r and i bands and 2.12 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J,
and H bands.

We detect the afterglow (Bolmer, et al., GCN 19058) cleanly in the first
epoch.  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the
following magnitudes:

 r = 18.13 +/- 0.01
 i = 17.43 +/- 0.01
 Z = 17.37 +/- 0.01
 Y = 17.20 +/- 0.01
 J = 17.08 +/- 0.01
 H = 16.81 +/- 0.01

The source is clearly fading during the first epoch.  In the second epoch,
we do not detect the source.  We obtain the following (3-sigma) upper
limits:

 r > 22.38
 i > 22.05
 Z > 21.49
 Y > 21.44
 J > 21.35
 H > 21.26

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
