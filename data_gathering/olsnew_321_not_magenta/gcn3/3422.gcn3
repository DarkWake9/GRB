G. Kosugi, H. Furusawa (Subaru/NAOJ), M. Takada (Tohoku U) and
N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report:

"We have observed the Swift/XRT position of GRB 050509B (GCN 3381)
in V-band with SuprimeCam on the Subaru 8.2m telescope atop Mauna
Kea on the night of May 9.  We obtained 600s exposure images at
08:08 UT (4.1 hr after the event) and 11:33 UT (7.5 hr after the event),
respectively.  We detect the four sources (S1-S4) mentioned in GCN 3401
along with other two sources (S5, S6) in GCN 3410.  In addition, another
source is detected (S7) within the XRT error circle.  No apparent
variability could be observed for these sources during the two epochs.

Our first epoch image is shown at:
