Team:

At 06:24:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a point source (trigger=230504). Swift slewed immediately to
the position. The BAT on-board calculated location is  RA,Dec
267.402, -28.340 {17h 49m 36s, -28d 20' 21"} (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). We note that this is the INTEGRAL source IGR
J17497-2821 and not a GRB.
