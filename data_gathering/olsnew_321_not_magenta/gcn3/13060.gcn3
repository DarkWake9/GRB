Vijay Kumar Bhatt, Brajesh Kumar and S.B. Pandey (ARIES,
Nainital, India, on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration)

We imaged the field of GRB120311A (Swift trigger 517469, Markwardt 
et al., GCN 13032) using 1.04m and 1.3m telescopes at ARIES Nainital 
starting ~16 hours after the burst. Several sets of 300s exposures 
were taken in R_c and I_c pass-bands.

We do not detect the optical afterglow candidate (Melandri et al., 
GCN 13033) in our stacked images to following limits. The photometry 
was performed in comparison to nearby USNO-B1 stars.
