SUBJECT: GRB 130313A: Swift-XRT detection of a possible X-ray afterglow

B.P. Gompertz & K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

Swift-XRT started observing the field of the short GRB 130313A 78 s after
the BAT trigger (Gompertz et al., GCN Circ. 14293). Using 662 s of XRT
Photon Counting mode data, we find a possible weak source at a position of
RA, Dec = 236.41005, -0.36874, which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 15h 45m 38.41s
Dec (J2000): -00d 22' 07.5"

with an uncertainty of 5.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is 1.9
arcmin from the BAT refined position (Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 14296),
within the error circle.

It is not possible to determine if the source is fading at this time.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
