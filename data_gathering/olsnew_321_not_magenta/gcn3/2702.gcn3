K. Pimbblet (University of Queensland) and P.A. Price (Institute for
Astronomy) report:

We have observed the error circle of HETE trigger #3557 with the 40-inch
telescope + Wide Field Imager in poor seeing conditions (~ 3 arcsec)
with an R filter at 2004 Sep 12.703 UTC.  Preliminary reduction involved
coaddition of 3 x 300 sec exposures, which cover most of the 22 arcmin
diameter error circle (missing the South-most 2 arcmin, and reduced
sensitivity in a mosaic gap) to a limiting magnitude of approximately 20
mag.  We do not identify any optical afterglow candidate after visually
comparing with the Digitised Sky Survey 2 F plate.

We plan to reduce and inspect further images, with an integration time
of approximately an hour.
