The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:56:38 UT on 7 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201007A (trigger 623732203.167578 / 201007123).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 297.0, Dec = 2.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 48m, 2d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51.0 degrees.
