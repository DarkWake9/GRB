report:

Beginning at March 29.112 (t[burst] + 15.33 hr) Chandra Low Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) observations commenced of
a field centered on the HETE WXM+SXC localizations (Villasenor et al,
GCN 1978) of GRB030328.  We report here on the first 2.6 ksec of data
downlinked from Chandra.  An X-ray source is detected at a location
consistent with that of the optical transient found by Peterson & Price
(GCN1974), and a total of 13 counts are observed in the 0.2-10 keV band in
the 0th order image.  Assuming a spectrum with photon index gamma=2 and
attenuated by a Galactic absorption column (nH=4.3 x 10^(20) cm^(-2)),
this corresponds to an average flux of ~3 x 10^(-13) ergs cm^(-2) s^(-1).

Our analyses are continuing, and more detailed results will be posted at:

We thank Harvey Tananbaum for his generous allocation of Director's
Discretion Time to this observation, and the Chandra X-ray
Observatory Operations personnel for the impressive promptness with
which this observation was planned and carried out.

The preliminary results reported here may be cited.
