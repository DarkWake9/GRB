WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift Trigger 783893 (D'Avanzo et al.,
GCN 22067) starting at 06:30:33 UT, 129 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. We do not detect any new source within the 3 arcmin
Swift-BAT error circle (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 22067), but note that
due to small field of view of KAIT telescope, we only cover about 70%
of the 3 arcmin error circle. The typical limiting magnitude
of our single clear image is about 19.0 calibrated to USNO B1.0.
Our result is consistent with the non-detection reported by
Guidorzi et al. (GCN 22068).
