The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1),
LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) data
around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S200208q
(GCN 27014). Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference
[1] and a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN
Notice, is available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200208q

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is well fit by
an ellipse with an area of 27 deg2 described by the following DS9
region (right ascension, declination, semi-major axis, semi-minor
axis, position angle of the semi-minor axis):
   icrs; ellipse(09h17m19s, -33d42m23s, 4d, 2d, 76d)
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 2142 +/- 459 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
