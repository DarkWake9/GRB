"Pi of the Sky" apparatus has moved to the Swift-BAT trigger 241963
and it has taken series of 10s exposures starting 170s after the GRB
(113s after the alert). No new object has been found within
the Swift-BAT error box. The limiting magnitude (unfiltered) is:
13.0 - 1 image,   08:14:35 - 08:14:35 UT
13.7 - 3 images,  08:14:35 - 08:15:12 UT
14.0 - 5 images,  08:14:35 - 08:15:39 UT
14.3 - 10 images, 08:14:35 - 08:16:47 UT

Three 10s images of this field have been taken at 07:33:22 - 07:34:02 UT
(37 minutes before the GRB). No new object is seen within the error box
and the limit is 13.2 magnitudo.
