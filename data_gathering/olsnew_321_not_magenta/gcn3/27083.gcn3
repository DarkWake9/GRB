D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC), and A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, 
DARK/NBI) report:

In PanSTARRS imaging of the field of GRB 200215A (Bernardini et al., GCN 
27079), we find a bright, extended object (1".5 x 1".7) at the edge of 
the enhanced XRT error circle given in Bernanrdini et al.

According to the PanSTARRS catalog, the source lies at:

RA = 02:16:19.065 (J2000)
Dec. = +12:46:09.67 (J2000)

The Kron magnitudes in the catalog are given as:

g_PS = 21.73 +/- 0.06,
r_PS = 20.90 +/- 0.07,
i_PS = 20.26 +/- 0.06,
z_PS = 19.89 +/- 0.05,
y_PS = 19.58 +/- 0.10

We suggest this galaxy may be the host galaxy of GRB 200215A, implying a 
low redshift.

There is another clear extended galaxy to the east of this source, the 
relationship between the two is unclear at this time.

Spectroscopy of these galaxies is encouraged.
