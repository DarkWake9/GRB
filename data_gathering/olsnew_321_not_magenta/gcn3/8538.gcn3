S. R. Oates  and P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) report on behalf of the Swift  
UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB081121 starting 2816  
seconds
after the BAT trigger (Oates et al., GCN 8537) with a White finding  
chart exposure
of 150 seconds. There is a candidate afterglow in the 2.7'x2.7' sub- 
image at

RA(J2000) =	05:57:06.19 = 89.27581
DEC(J2000) = -60:36:10.3 = -60.60286

with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.62 arc sec. This  
position is 0.7
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle and is consistent  
with the position
of the optical afterglow found by ROTSE-IIIc (Yuan el al., GCN 8536).

The estimated magnitude is 17.98 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.04. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to  
E(B-V) of 0.05.
