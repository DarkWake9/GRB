report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered on-ground by
a bright short burst from SGR J1555.2-5402 at 2021-09-07T19:15:21.100 UTC (T0),
which was also detected by Fermi/GBM.

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 15-60 keV, this burst
mainly consists of a single pulse with T90 of 18 ms measured from
T0-0.014 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Since this burst has very few counts registered on GECAM-B detectors, the location
given by GECAM-B alone is quite coarse but broadly consistent with SGR J1555.2-5402.

According to our multiple-mission joint location pipeline (S. Xiao et al.,
accepted by ApJ) using GECAM-B and Fermi/GBM data, this burst is localized to
an annulus which is very consistent with SGR J1555.2-5402. 

The GECAM-GBM joint location could be found here:

Considering these results stated above and some activities reported recently,
we conclude that this burst is from SGR J1555.2-5402.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
