report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 150206A (Hagen et al. GCN 17413) with
the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph, equipped with the UVB/VIS/NIR arms and
covering the wavelength range 3000-25000 AA. In a 4x600 s spectrum we
detect absorption features of ZnII, FeII, and MgII at a common
redshift of z=2.087. The spectral trace is down to ~3760 AA, being
consistent with a Lya feature at the same redshift. We thus think this
is the redshift of the GRB.

We acknowledge excellent support from the observing staff at Paranal,
in particular Dimitri Gadotti.
