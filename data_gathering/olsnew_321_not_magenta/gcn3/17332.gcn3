WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on 
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150120A (D'Elia et al.,
GCN 17310) starting at 02:59:24 UT, 98 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. We do not detect any new source in our
images within the enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al.,
GCN 17317). The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear
image is about 18.5 calibrated to USNO B1.0.
