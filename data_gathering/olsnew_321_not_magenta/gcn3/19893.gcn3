The AMI Large Array triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 160821A (Siegel 
et al., GCN 19830) as part of the 4pisky program, and subsequent follow 
up observations were obtained up to 10 days post-burst. Our observations 
at 15 GHz on 2016 Aug 22.55, Aug 23.56, Aug 25.56, and Aug 29.56 (UT) do 
not reveal any transient radio source within the BAT error circle 
(Markwardt et al., GCN 19840), with 3sigma upper limits of 87 uJy, 108 
uJy, 108 uJy, and 102 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
