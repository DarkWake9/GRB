L. Izzo, M. Blazek (HETH-IAA/CSIC), A. de Ugarte Postigo (DARK/NBI & HETH-IAA/CSIC), D. A. Kann, C. C. Thoene (HETH-IAA/CSIC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 190203A (Lien et al. GCN 23845) with the IO:I camera mounted on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain. Observations started on February 3rd at 20:31:17 UT (4.72 hours after the GRB trigger) and we obtained a series of 10x60s images in the H filter.

In our stacked image, we find no source at the position of the observed counterpart (Moskvitin  et al. GCN 23847, Lipunov et al. GCN 23850) down to a 3-sigma limit of H(AB) > 20.1 mag. The calibration was performed using four nearby 2MASS stars.
