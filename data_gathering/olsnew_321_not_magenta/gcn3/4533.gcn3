At 06:50:01 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 060117 (trigger=177666).
The spacecraft did not slew because of the Sun observing constraint.
It will come out of the Swift observing constraint on 07 Feb 2006.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 327.926d,-59.980d
{21h 51m 42s,-59d 58' 49"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows
a bright multi-peak structure with a total duration of ~25 sec.
The peak count rate was ~40,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~12 seconds
after the trigger.

We note that this is within 3 arcmin of the bright (J=13.0 mag) galaxy
IRAS 21482-6015.
