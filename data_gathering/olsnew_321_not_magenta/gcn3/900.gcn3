V. Mohan, Ram Sagar, S.B. Pandey (UPSO, Nainital), and
A. J. Castro-Tirado, IAA-CSIC (Granada) and  LAEFF-INTA (Madrid),
on behalf of a larger collaboration,

report:

"We have imaged 80% of the error box for GRB 001212 (Hurley et al.,
GCN 899) with the 1.0-m telescope of U.P. State Observatory, Nainital.
4 R-band frames (300-s exposure time each) were obtained on Dec 14.85 UT
(i.e. 53 hours after the GRB).  When comparing to the DSS-2 (R-band),
down to a limiting magnitude of R = 21.0, we found an object that
has become brighter by about 1.5 mag. Its position is AR(2000) =
06 49 38.1  Dec(2000) = +36 22 52 (+/- 2"). Follow-up observations are
encouraged in order to confirm whether this is the GRB 001212 optical
counterpart."
