B. E. Cobb (UC Berkeley) reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we obtained
optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 090424 (GCN 9223, Cannizzo
et al.) over nine epochs between ~0.5 and 5.6 days post burst.  In our
first epoch of imaging, total summed exposure times amounted to
15 minutes in I and V and 12 minutes in J and K.  All later epochs had
total summed exposure times of 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The optical afterglow of GRB 090424 (e.g. GCN 9223, Cannizzo
et al. & GCN 9224, Yuan et al.) is observed to fade steadily in our
imaging with no indication of a jet break between ~0.5 and 5.6 days 
post-burst.  The combined light of the afterglow and the underlying galaxy
fades with a decay rate of alpha = -0.72 (where afterglow flux is 
proportional to t^alpha).  Assuming that the galaxy has an intrinsic 
magnitude of I=21.6 (based on the SDSS i and r values and the Lupton 2005 
transformation equations), then the afterglow's true decay rate is
alpha = -1.2 over these epochs.

The afterglow + host galaxy photometry is measured as follows (no
correction has been made for Galactic extinction):
