W. Landsman (SSAI/GSFC) and C. Pagani (PSU) report on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began taking data in the field of GRB070506 459s after 
the BAT trigger (Pagani et al., GCN 6375). A fading afterglow is weakly 
detected in the White, B and V UVOT  filters, but not in the U or UV 
filters.      We use the combined white image to obtain an improved 
position of

RA(J2000) = 23h 08m 52.39s  Dec(J2000) = +10d 43' 20.8"

with a 1-sigma uncertainty radius of about 0.5".    This is 0.5" from 
the UVOT position reported by Pagani et al. (GCN 6375) and 2.9" from the 
refined XRT position reported by Pagani et al. (GCN 6377).

Photometry results are given for the 7 UVOT filters below.
