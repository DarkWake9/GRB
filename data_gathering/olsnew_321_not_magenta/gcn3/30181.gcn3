SUBJECT: GRB 210610B: iTelescope optical afterglow observations

I observed the field of GRB 201223A (Page et al., GCN Circ. 30170)
with remote telescope T18 (0.32-m f/8.0 reflector + CCD) of
iTelescope.Net in observatory AstroCamp at Nerpio (Spain). Two images
(with exposures 300 seconds, BINx1) were obtained with Astrodon
luminance filter on 2021-06-10 since 21:40:19 UTC (1 hour 48 minutes
52 seconds after the trigger) and since 21:47:05 UTC (1 hour 55
minutes 38 seconds after the trigger).

I clearly detected the optical afterglow with position: RA 16:15:40.38
 Dec +14:23:56.5 (+/- 0.15"). The following magnitudes were measured
from comparison to r magnitudes of nearby stars from Pan-STARRS DR1
catalogue (Chambers et al., 2016): 17.33 (+/- 0.033) and 17.281 (+/-
0.029).

Magnitudes were not corrected for Galactic extinction.
