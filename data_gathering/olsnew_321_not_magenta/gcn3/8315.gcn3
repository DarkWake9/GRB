A. von Kienlin (MPE) and M.S. Briggs (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM
Team: 

"On 3 October 2008 the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor triggered and located
three bursts from the Galatic source, reported by SWIFT (H. A. Krimm  et
al., GCN Circ. 8311, GCN Circ. 8312). Later the source of this burst was
identified being the AXP 1E1547.0-5408 (N. Rea et al., GCN Circ. 8313).

GBM triggered at: 

09:03:06 UT (trigger 244717387; GBM 081003.377)in the 25 to 50 keV energy
band with an integration time of 32 ms.

09:14:00 UT (trigger 244718041; GBM 081003.385)in the 25 to 50 keV energy
band with an integration time of 64 ms.

10:42:53 UT (trigger 244723369; GBM 081003.446)in the 50 to 300 keV energy
band with an integration time of 64 ms.

The GBM on-board locations are all consistent with the AXP 1E1547.0-5408
position.

The GBM triggers are not coincident in time with the Swift triggers, so
there are a total of seven bursts from this AXP.


The on-ground improved locations and results of spectral analysis will be
reported soon."
