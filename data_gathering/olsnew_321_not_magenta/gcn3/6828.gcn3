SUBJECT: GRB070925: Swift-XRT Afterglow confirmation

L. Vetere, C. Pagani (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Additional Swift-XRT observations have been performed of the possible
X-ray afterglow of GRB 070925 (Vetere et al., GCN 6826). The count rate
at T+72h is ~3e-3 counts/s. Between 1.3e4 and 1.4e5 seconds after the burst,
the source has faded following a power-law decay slope of alpha = 1.2 +/- 0.3,
confirming that it is, indeed, the afterglow.
If the burst keeps decaying at the current rate the predicted count rate at
T+96h is 5.6e-4 counts/s.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
