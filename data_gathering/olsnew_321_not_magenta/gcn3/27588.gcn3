S. Gupta, V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 200412A, which was also detected by BALROG (Kunzweiler F. et al., GCN #27546) , Fermi GBM (Mailyan B. et al., GCN #27550), Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov V. et al., GCN #27559), IPN (Hurley K. et al., GCN #27560) and Konus-Wind (Ridnaia A. et al., GCN #27577).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-04-12 06:57:14.500 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 2671 +/- 57 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 12092 +/- 16 cts. The local mean background count rate was 487 +/- 0.8 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 12.5 +/- 0.002 s. In preliminary analysis, we find that 959 Compton events are associated with this event.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
