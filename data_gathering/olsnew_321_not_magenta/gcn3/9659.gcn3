A. Rowlinson (U Leicester), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and
T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 03:51:05 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090712 (trigger=357072).  Swift could not slew due to 
the Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 70.103, +22.557 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 40m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = +22d 33' 26"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single broad
triangular peak structure with a duration of about 100 sec.  
The peak count rate was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), 
at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of the constraint, the BAT position is unobservable 
by Swift until 21st July 2009. There will thus be no prompt XRT or UVOT 
data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. T. Holland (sholland AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
