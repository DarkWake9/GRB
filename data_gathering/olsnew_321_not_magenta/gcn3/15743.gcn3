Z. Cano (U. Iceland), D. Xu, D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), P. Jakobsson (U Iceland), T. Pursimo (NOT) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140114A (Troja et al., GCN Circ. 15728) with the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC starting at 03:19 UT on 15-Jan-2014. We obtained 12x300 s frames in SDSS-i at a mean time of 15.93 hr after the burst.

The afterglow is clearly detected in the stacked image at coordinates:

RA: 12:34:05.1
Dec: +27:57:02.6

with an uncertainty of 0.5''. This position is 1.4'' from the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 15733), and falls within the enhanced XRT error circle. This is presumably the source detected by Butler et al. (GCN Circ. 15732). The afterglow has m(i)=23.19+/-0.16 AB at 15.93 hr post-burst, calibrated with the nearby SDSS stars and not corrected for foreground extinction.
