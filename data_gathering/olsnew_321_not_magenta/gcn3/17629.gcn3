report:

We observed the field of GRB 150323C (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 17621)
using the 0.35m robotic Xingming telescope located at Nanshan,
Xinjiang, China. Observations started at 17:08:06 UT on 2015-03-23,
i.e., 165 s after the burst, and a series of 40s, 60s, and 90s
unfiltered exposures were obtained.

No optical source is detected at the enhanced Swift-XRT position
(Evans, GCN 17624), down to a limiting magnitude of ~19.2 mag since
the starting of our observations.
