H. Mikuz, J. Skvarc and B. Dintinjana on behalf of PIKA observing program
at Crni Vrh Observatory:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 070411 (Moretti et al., GCN 6267) with 60
cm Cichocki robotic telescope at Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia. The 90
second exposure with R filter started at 20:14:01UT, 48 seconds after
reception of the alert. We confirm optical afterglow found by UVOT. The
object measured coordinates are ra=07:09:19.95, dec=+01:03:52.8,
approximate brightness is R=17.9. The object faded on subsequent images.

Further photometric analysis is in progress.
