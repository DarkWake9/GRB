S. Gupta, V. Sharma, A. Vibhute and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (IUCAA/TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed detection of a long GRB 201114A.

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-11-14 00:39:25.539 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 463 +/- 28 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 6961 +/- 43 cts. The local mean background count rate was  753 +/- 1 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 32.67 +/- 0.02 s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
