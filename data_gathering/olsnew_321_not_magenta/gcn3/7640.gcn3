Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080426 (trigger #310219)
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN Circ. 7639).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 26.510, 69.469 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 46m 02.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +69d 28' 07.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 43%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at T+0 and
ending at T+2.0 sec.  The lag analysis yields:
  Lag31 = 88 +/- 9 ms  (50-100 to 15-25 keV bands)
  Lag21 = 74 +/- 6 ms  (25-50  to 15-25 keV bands)
T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.7 +- 0.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
While the T90 value puts this burst in the middle of the long and Short burst
T90-distribution peaks, the lag value puts this burst in the Long burst class.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.1 to T+2.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.98 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

We note that this is an unusual burst.  The T90 for the 50-300 keV  
BATSE range is 1.3 sec which would put it in the short class in that  
era.  However, the long lag and a spectrum that is not hard lead us  
to believe it is in the long class.
