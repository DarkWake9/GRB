Using the data set from T-240 to T+622 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140629A (trigger #602884)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 16477).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 249.017, 41.897 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 36m 04.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 53' 49.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 41%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-8 sec, peaking at ~T+12 sec, and ending at ~T+90 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 42.0 +- 14.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.53 to T+56.47 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.86 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+12.47 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.2 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
