T. Sakamoto (NASA/ORAU) on behalf of the Swift Team:

The XRT paragraph in the GCN 6594 contains a error.  We stated 
that the XRT position was "outside" the BAT error circle -- it is, 
in fact, inside.  The corrected XRT paragraph is:

The XRT began observing the field at 20:08:30 UT, 153 seconds after the
BAT trigger. The on-board XRT position was not correct, because the 
algorithm centroided on a hot pixel.  From the ground data analysis,  
a moderately bright and uncatalogued X-ray source was found 
at RA, Dec 354.69922, + 66.25226 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 38m 47.8s
   Dec(J2000) =  66d 15' 08.1"
with an uncertainty of 5.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 40.8 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position 
and within the BAT error circle.  The initial flux in the 2.5s 
image was 3.7e-10 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

We apologize for the mistake.  We would like to thank Alex Kann 
for pointing the error.
