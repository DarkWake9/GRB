We observed the field of Swift/BAT-GUANO position (DeLaunay et al., GCNs 
28013, 28016) of  GRB 200623A (Fermi GBM team,  GCN 28011; Veres et al., 
GCN 28019) with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory 
starting on 2020-06-23 (UT) 18:46:58.  We  detected only one object 
within the XRT #2 source localization 
(https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021005/). The source is not 
presented in SDSS DR12. We suggest the object could be afterglow of  GRB 
200623A. However at this time we cannot confirm variability of the 
object.   Preliminary photometry of the object is following.

No new objects were found in the localization of the XRT # 3 source.

The photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars
