MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Tunka was pointed to the  GRB140311B 29 sec after notice time 
and 107 sec after trigger time at 2014-03-11 21:16:16 UT in two 
polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) set we haven`t found optical 
transient  within SWIFT error-box (Racusin et. al. GCN 15945). The 5-sigma 
upper limit has been about 17.0 mag. The observations is proceed.

MASTER II  robotic telescope located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the 
GRB140311B 9 sec after notice time and 85 sec after trigger time at 
2014-03-11 21:15:54 UT in two polarizations. On our first (20s exposure) 
set we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 14.0 mag. The observations on this 
place made on the bright morning sky.
