We observed the field of GRB 171004A (Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 21966)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/10 4.45 to
2017/10 4.45 to 2017/10 4.52 UTC (2.97 to 4.45 hours after the BAT
trigger), obtaining a total of 1.07 hours exposure in the r and i bands
and 0.45 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We detect two sources within the Swift-XRT error circle. One is a
cataloged SDSS source. The other is at 09:16:40.66 +52:41:30.4 (J2000
+/- 0.5 arcsec) and, in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS catalogs,
has

  r	= 21.91 +/- 0.11
  i	= 21.32 +/- 0.07
  Z	= 21.13 +/- 0.15
  Y	= 20.43 +/- 0.12
  J	= 20.45 +/- 0.15
  H	= 19.88 +/- 0.13

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
