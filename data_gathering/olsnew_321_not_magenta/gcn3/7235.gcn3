Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080129 (trigger #301981)
(Immler, et al., GCN Circ. 7226).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 105.297, -7.840 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 07h 01m 11.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -7d 50' 24" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single broad peak starting at ~T-20 sec,
peaking at ~T+20, and ending at ~T+50.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 48 +- 10 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.0 to T+49.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.9 +- 1.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+24.50 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.2 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

The majority of the indicators say this is a GRB, but at this time
we can not rule out a galactic source explanation for this trigger.
