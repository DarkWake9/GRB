W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R.Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and Mars Odyssey-HEND observed this burst at 16451 s.

As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of about 150 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately 1.4E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  1.0E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to two alternate, preliminary, 3 sigma error
boxes each with approximate area 110. square arcminutes whose
coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)

 ERROR BOX CORNER 11:  7 h 58 m 17.24 s     41 o 29 '  25.08 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 12:  7 h 57 m 53.51 s     41 o 41 '  52.39 "

There is a chance that the ambiguity can be resolved by further
processing.  These error boxes may be improved.

A map will be posted shortly at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/020708.  Note
that somewhat larger, four-sided error boxes were circulated in the GCN
socket message, for reasons related to the formatting of those
messages.  The above, smaller error boxes are the more precise ones.
