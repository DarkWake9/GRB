Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), V. D'Elia (ASDC) and
F.E. Marshall report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 2.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 181022A (Marshall et al.
GCN Circ. 23364), from 106 s to 5.4 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The best available XRT
position  (using the promptly downlinked event data, the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue) is
RA, Dec = 56.7920, -29.3798 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 03 47 10.09
Dec(J2000): -29 22 47.2

with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.73 (+/-0.24).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.7 (+/-0.5). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.9 (+2.9, -1.9) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 8.8 x 10^19 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.4 x 10^-11 (5.7 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     2.9 (+2.9, -1.9) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 8.8 x 10^19 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.5 sigma
Photon index:	     1.7 (+/-0.5)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.73, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.2 x 10^-5 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.4 x
10^-16 (7.1 x 10^-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
