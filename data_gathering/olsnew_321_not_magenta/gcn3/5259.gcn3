TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5259
SUBJECT: GRB 060614, SMARTS optical/IR afterglow observation

B. E. Cobb (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 060614
(GCN 5252, Parsons et al.) with a mid-exposure time of
2006-06-15 04:16 UT (~15.5 hours post-burst).
Total summed exposure times for each observation amounted
to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The afterglow of GRB 060614 (GCN 5255, Holland et al.) is visible in
each combine image.  The preliminary magnitudes reported below were
calibrated using several USNO-B1.0 stars in the I-band and three
2MASS standards in J.

Given that the afterglow was also reported to have an R magnitude
of ~19 at approximately 5.8 and 7.1 hours post-burst (GCN 5258, Schmidt et 
al. & GCN 5257, French et al.), it is clear that the behavior of this
afterglow continues to deviate from a typical smoothly decaying 
power-law.
