Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140506A (trigger #598284)
(Gompertz, et al., GCN Circ. 16214).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 276.806, -55.556 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 27m 13.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 33' 20.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 11%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve a bright initial pulse strting at ~T-5 sec,
peaking at ~T+0.2 sec, and returning to baseline at ~T+5 sec. Then there were
two weaker peaks at ~T+60 sec and at ~T+110 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
111.1 +- 9.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.20 to T+120.18 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.68 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 10.9 +- 0.9 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
