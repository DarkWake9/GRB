Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 091102 (trigger #374598)
(Hoversten, et al., GCN Circ. 10117).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 72.622, -72.527 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 50m 29.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -72d 31' 37.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.
 
Because the s/c slewed for an observing constraint, the burst location
went out of the BAT FOV at T+160 sec, and then came back into the FOV
at T+900 sec.  The mask-weighted light curve shows a couple slightly overlapping
peaks starting at ~T-2 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.  There is now measurable
flux at T+900 sec when the location comes back into the FOV.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 6.6 +- 0.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.8 to T+6.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.08 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.2 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.26 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
