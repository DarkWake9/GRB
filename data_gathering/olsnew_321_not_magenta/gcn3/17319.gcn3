report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:57:47.00 UT on 20 January 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150120A (trigger 443415470/150120123), which was
also detected by the Swift/BAT & XRT
(D'Elia et al. 2015, GCN 17310). The GBM on-ground location is consistent
with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 98 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.024 s to T0+0.512 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.43 (+0.28/-0.24) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 130 (+150/-50) keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.4 +/- 0.8)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.64 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
