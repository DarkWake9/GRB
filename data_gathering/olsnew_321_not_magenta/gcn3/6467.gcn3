We have imaged the field of GRB 070529 (Holland et al., GCN 6466)
with the Xinglong TNT 80cm telescope. Observation was performed
with V and R band. We noticed this was a crowded field and we didn't
detect the OT (Holland et al., GCN 6466) in our combined images,
the R band 3 sigma upper limit is ~20.1 derived from USNO-B1.0 with
mean time 2.03 hours after the burst.
