The Swift/UVOT began observations of the Fermi/LAT localization (GCN
32131) of GRB 220527A , collecting 1.7 ks of u band data between
T0+30.1 ks
and T0+31.9 ks after the Fermi GBM detection (32133).
A source consistent with the XRT afterglow position (GCN 32135) is
detected in the UVOT observation.

The preliminary UVOT position is:
RA,Dec (J2000): 323.52803, -14.97169

with an estimated u band magnitude of 17.8 +/- 0.07 in the UVOT
photometric system.
