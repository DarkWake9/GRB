S. B. Cenko and A. Rau (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB070724B (Feroci et al., GCN 6668), the
first GRB detected by SuperAGILE, with the automated Palomar 60-inch
telescope.  Observations consisted of 5 x 180 s images in the i' filter at
a mean epoch of approximately UT 06:46:30 on 2007 July 26 (~ 31.3 hours
after the burst).  We do not detect any sources inside the error circle of
the likely XRT afterglow (Romano et al., GCN 6675) to a limiting
magnitude of i' > 21.0 (calculated with respect to several USNO-B stars
in the field).
