K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 77317 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 6 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.8E-07 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  2.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 151.649,  35.188 degrees, whose radius is 69.765 +/-  0.132
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
