A. Cucchiara, D. Fox (PSU) & N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 091024 (Marshall et al. GCN 10062;
Mundell et al. GCN 10063) with the GMOS-N spectrograph on Gemini North
beginning at 10.43 UT.  The resultant spectrum, which spans 5925A to 10200A,
shows a strong continuum and well detected lines of CaII H & K, MgI (2853A)
at a common redshift of z=1.092.  Further analysis is ongoing.

We thank the Gemini-N support staff, in particular R. Pike, for
obtaining these observations.
