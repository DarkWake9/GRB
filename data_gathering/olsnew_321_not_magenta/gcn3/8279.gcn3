of the Swift Team:

At 07:55:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) imaged and
located Trigger 325461.  Swift slewed immediately to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 130.138, -45.045 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 40m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 02' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger,
there are no obvious variations in the TDRSS lightcurve. 
This location is consistent with the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient
(SFXT) source IGR J08408-4503 (= LM Vel). 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:57:32.6 UT, 143.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found an X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 130.1974, -45.0591 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 08h 40m 47.37s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 03' 32.7"
with an uncertainty of 4.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 159 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle, and is consistent with the SFXT IGR J08408-4503. 
No event data are yet available to determine the
column density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 400 seconds with the V filter starting
881 seconds after the BAT trigger. Analysis will be reported later. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vanessa AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
