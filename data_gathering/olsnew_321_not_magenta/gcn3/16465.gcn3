A. Melandri, P. D’Avanzo, M. G. Bernardini (INAF/OAB) and N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift team:

We have analysed 0.96 ks of Swift/XRT data for the BAT-detected trigger 602668 (Bernardini et al., GCN Circ. 16463), from 758 s to 1.73 ks after the BAT trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. No bright X-ray afterglow is detected within the BAT error circle. The 3 sigma upper limit is 4.1E-02 cts/s.

The Swift/UVOT observed the field from 744 s to 1.73 ks after the BAT trigger. No optical afterglow is detected in the UVOT exposures.

The lack of an XRT or UVOT detection confirms that this trigger was not an astrophysical source.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
