report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:11:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 121014A (trigger=535960).  Swift did not slew because 
of sun constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 166.631, -29.109, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 06m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 06' 31"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows an initial 1-2 sec spike
at T0, and then smaller and longer peaks at ~T+20 sec and ~T+50 sec. 
structure with a duration of about 60 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 05:22 UT on 2012 October 30. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (yarleen AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
