behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:02:11 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090408 (trigger=348720).  Swift will execute a delayed slew
to the burst.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 231.618, +37.564, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 26m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = +37d 33' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT TDRSS light curve shows nothing significant
as is typical for an image trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+55 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
