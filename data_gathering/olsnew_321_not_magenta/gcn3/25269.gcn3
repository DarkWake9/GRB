The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:32:30 UT on 5 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190805A (trigger 586665155.450396 / 190805106).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 167.6, Dec = -23.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 10m, -23d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 121.0 degrees.
