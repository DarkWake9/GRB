A. N. Morgan,  G. C. Bower (UC Berkeley), report:

We observed the field of GRB 090709A (Morris et al., GCN 9625) with
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA)
at an average frequency of 88.5 GHz beginning at 2009-07-15 04:41:33
UT, ~5.88 days after the Swift trigger.  No source was detected at the
position of the NIR/optical afterglow (Aoki et al., GCN 9634; Morgan
et al., GCN 9635; Cenko et al., GCN 9646; Guidorzi et al., GCN 9648)
down to the following limits:

post_burst
t_mid(d)  exp(h)  freq_mid(GHz)  bandwidth(MHz)  flux (mJy)
5.98      3.79    88.5           3000            < 1.1 (3 sig)

The quasar 1849+670 was used as a phase calibrator, and fluxes were
calibrated to an observation of Neptune taken at the end of the track.

We thank the staff and observers at CARMA and instructors of the CARMA
Summer School for excellent support during the observations and
analysis.
