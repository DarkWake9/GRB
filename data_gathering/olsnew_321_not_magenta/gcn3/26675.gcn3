The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The LIGO/Virgo data from the time of the subthreshold GW compact
binary merger candidate S200105ae continues to be under study.
We still intend to provide an updated sky map and estimated
Probability of remnant mass around the final compact object,
but those parameter estimation studies are still in progress.
