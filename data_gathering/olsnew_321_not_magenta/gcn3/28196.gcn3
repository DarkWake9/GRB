The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:34:26 UT on 3 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200803A (trigger 618118471.567908 / 200803149).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 313.6, Dec = -62.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 54m, -62d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 39.0 degrees.
