K. Hurley, S. Barthelmy, R. M. Kippen, and T. Cline, on behalf
of the Ulysses, BATSE, and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, BATSE, and NEAR observed GRB000408 (=BATSE 8069)
at 9348 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses, this burst had a
T90 duration of 2.5 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of 7.4x10^-6 erg/cm^2,
and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 3.7x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  Preliminary
triangulation gives a ~200 sq. arcmin. error box with the
following coordinates:

     RA(2000)           DEC(2000)
9 h 10 m 31.86 s    66 o 34 '  35.72 "  (CENTER)
9 h 14 m 57.83 s    66 o 30 '  25.93 "  (CORNER)
9 h  7 m 41.72 s    66 o 33 '  18.90 "  (CORNER)
9 h 13 m 19.82 s    66 o 35 '  43.51 "  (CORNER)
9 h  5 m 56.89 s    66 o 38 '  22.95 "  (CORNER)

It should be possible to refine this error box considerably
within 24 h, when the high time resolution data become
available.
