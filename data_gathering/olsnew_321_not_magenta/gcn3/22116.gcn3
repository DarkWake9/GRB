report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

During the commissioning phase, at 2017-11-03T23:10:32.04 (T0),
Insight-HXMT/HE detected GRB 171103A (trigger ID: HEB171103965)
in a routine search of the data,which is also detected by
Swift/BAT (Ukwatta et al.,GCN 22095), Fermi/GBM (Veres et al., GCN 22100),
Konus-Wind (Tsvetkova et al.,GCN 22101) and AstroSat/CZTI
(Sharma et al., GCN 22103).

The Insight-HXMT light curve mainly consists of multi-pulses
with a duration (T90) of 0.21 s measured from T0+0.033 s.
The 10-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.096 s, is 19946.0 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 2915.7 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.05 s to T0+0.30 s is
adequately fit by a Power Law model with spectral index = -0.97 ± 0.07.
The energy fluence is (4.1 ± 0.3)e-6 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 5000 keV
in this time interval.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information could be found at:
