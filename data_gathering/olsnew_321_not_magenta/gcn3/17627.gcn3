Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:05:09.64 UT on 23 March 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150323C (trigger 448823112 / 150323712)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Amaral-Rogers et al. 2015, GCN 17621)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 58 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 43 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10.24 s to T0+30.72 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.15 +/- 0.16 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 107 +/- 18 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.50 +/- 0.19)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.22 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 1.64 +/- 0.20 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
