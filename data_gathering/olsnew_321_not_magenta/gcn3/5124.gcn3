Using the data set from T-119.9 to T+182.2 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060512
(trigger #209755)  (Cummings, et al., GCN 5117).  The BAT 
ground-calculated position
is (RA,Dec) = 195.746, 41.209 deg {13h 2m 59.0s, 41d 12' 30.8"} (J2000)
+- 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial 
coding was 41%.

The masked-tagged light curve shows a single peak from about T-4 sec to T+8 sec
with most emission in the band from 15 to 50 keV.   T90 (15-350 keV) is
8.6 +- 2 sec (estimated error including systematics).  There is no
significant further emission in the flight-generated masked-tagged light
curve out to T+450 sec.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.4 to T+5.3 is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.49 +- 0.30.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.3 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+3.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
