report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Around the trigger time (T0=2020-04-30T21:43:00.5 UTC) of the highly
polarised radio burst event reported by FAST (ATel #13699),
Insight-HXMT was carrying out the ToO observation
of SGR 1935+2154 without any occultation by the Earth.

Within T0 +/- 50 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma)
are found in a search of the Insight-HXMT LE (1-10 keV), ME(10-30 keV)
and HE (27-250 keV) light curves.

Assuming the same spectral
model to the X-ray counterpart that we reported in ATel #13687,
and with one second timescale (1 s) coming from the position
of SGR1935+2154, the 3-sigma fluence upper-limits are as following:

Model: wabs*Cutoffpl (nH=2.6,PhoIndex=1.44, Ecut=69.8 keV):
LE:  2.68e-09 erg cm^-2
ME:  3.45e-09 erg cm^-2
HE:  4.46e-09 erg cm^-2

Insight-HXMT will continue to observe SGR 1935+2154 with LE, ME and HE
until 2020-05-06 01:20:47 UT.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
