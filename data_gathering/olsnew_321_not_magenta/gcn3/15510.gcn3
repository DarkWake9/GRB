TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  15510
SUBJECT: GRB 131122A: a long GRB detected with INTEGRAL

D. Gotz (CEA Saclay), S. Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), E. Bozzo, C. Ferrigno, (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the  IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 70 s  has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 21:25:01 U.T. on November 22.
Its refined  coordinates (J2000)  are:

  R.A.: 152.5553 deg
  DEC.: 57.7398 deg

with an uncertainty of 1.6 arc min (90% c.l.).

The burst had a fluence of about 2x10^-6 erg/cmsq in the 20-200 keV energy band, and a peak flux of 0.4 ph/cmsq/s in the same energy band over 1 s.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
