SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S190814bv: No neutrino candidates at Pierre Auger Observatory

J. Alvarez-Muniz, F. Pedreira, E. Zas (Univ. Santiago de Compostela, Spain),
K. H. Kampert & M. Schimp (Bergische Universitat, Wuppertal, Germany)
on behalf of the Pierre Auger Collaboration.

In response to:
LIGO/Virgo GW trigger S190814bv
T0=2019-08-14   21:10:39 UTC

We searched for Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) neutrinos with energies
above ~ 1e17 eV in data collected with the Surface Detector (SD)
of the Pierre Auger Observatory in a [-500,500] second interval
about the LIGO-Virgo trigger S190814bv as well as 1 day after it.

NO events survived the cuts applied to reject the background due to UHE
Cosmic Rays i.e.
NO NEUTRINO CANDIDATES WERE DETECTED.

The field of view (fov) where the SD of Auger is sensitive to UHE
neutrinos (corresponding to inclined directions with respect to the
vertical relative to the ground) was NOT COINCIDENT with
the LIGO/Virgo 90% localization region at the time T0 of the merger alert,
achieving 100% OVERLAP at approximately T0+3.2 hours for a time period
of approximately 2.7 hours.

-------
The Pierre Auger Observatory is an UHE Cosmic Ray detector
located in the Mendoza Province in Argentina. It consists of
an array of Water Cherenkov detectors spread over a total surface
of 3000 km^2 arranged in a triangular grid of 1.5 km side as well
as Fluorescence telescopes and other systems
(see 10.1016/j.nima.2015.06.058 for more information).
