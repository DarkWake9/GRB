J. Mao, X.-L. Wang, and J.-M. Bai report:


We followed the possible candidate given by Paterson et al. (GCN 26360) and observed it with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories. The observation began at UT 11:27:08, 6th, Dec., 2019, about 13.5 hours after the GW trigger (GCN 26350). We obtained the preliminary magnitude of R~20.5. We are not sure that this source is associated with S191205ah (McBrien et al. GCN 26364).
