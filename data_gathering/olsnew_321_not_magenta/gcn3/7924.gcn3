At 01:10:41, Swift-BAT observed GRB 080702B. The burst occurred
during a preplanned Swift slew maneuver. The rate increase was
noted during a routine check of the counting rates for missed out-
of-field and slew bursts. A GRB candidate was automatically 
detected by the BAT Slew Survey (BATSS) with 5.9 sigma in the 
S band (15-50 keV) and 6.5 sigma in the B band (15-150keV). 
The burst profile is FRED-like with ~3sec rise and ~30sec decay. 
The peak count rate is 0.05cts/sec (S band) and 0.04cts/sec (B band). 
BATSS automated analysis measured T90 = 10.5sec and T50 = 5.5sec, 
and a position 

RA = 23h 42m 24s, DEC = -05d 29' 23" 

with a 90% confidence radius of 6.4arcmin. 

Further ground analysis of this GRB yielded a location 
RA, Dec 355.616,  -5.424 (J2000) or

RA = 23h 42m 27.8s
Dec = -05d 25' 26.4"

with an estimated error radius of 3 arcmin. A Swift TOO request was 
submitted, and Swift/XRT and UVOT began observing at about 18:30, 
approximately 17.3 hours after the burst.
