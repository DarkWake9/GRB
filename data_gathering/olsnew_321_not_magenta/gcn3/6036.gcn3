F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and J. Racusin (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift team:

Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 070125 (Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 6024)
starting 13 hours after the burst. A bright, fading source
at the position reported by Cenko (GCN Circ. 6034)
is detected with the V and B filters. Additional observations
are now being taken with the other UVOT filters.

The table below gives the measured magnitudes for the currently
available data. T_start and T_end are the start and stop
times of the summed exposures in seconds from the trigger.
No correction has been made for the expected
Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05.
