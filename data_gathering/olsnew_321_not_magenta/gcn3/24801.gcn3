SUBJECT: GRB 190613A: KAIT Optical Afterglow Confirmation

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 190613A (Ambrosi et al.,
GCN 24798) starting at 734s after the burst. Observations were
performed with a sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters,
and the exposure time was 60 s per image. We detected a fading source
at the Swift/UVOT reported afterglow position (Ambrosi et al.,
GCN 24798) in all the filters. We estimate the clear band magnitude
to be ~18.2 at 764s after the burst and faded to ~19.0 at 1290s after the
burst.
Observation are on going, multi-band follow-ups are encouraged.
