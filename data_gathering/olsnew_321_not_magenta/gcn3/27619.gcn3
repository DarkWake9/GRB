Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported single track-like event IceCube-200117A (GCN 27612< https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27612.gcn3>). The original reconstructed origin was 25.0 degrees below the horizon for ANTARES. <br>
No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded at the location of the IceCube event coordinates (accounting for the reported uncertainties) during a +/- 1h time-window centered on the IceCube event time, and over which the potential source remained visible all time. A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (45% visibility). <br>

This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 15 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 3.9 TeV â€“ 4.0 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 27 GeV.cm^-2 (720 GeV - 380 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. <br>

ANTARES <http://antares.in2p3.fr/ <http://antares.in2p3.fr/>> is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
