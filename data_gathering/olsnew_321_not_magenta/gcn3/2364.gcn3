D.B. Fox and M.P. Hunt (Caltech) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO
GRB Collaboration:  

"We have observed the HETE-2 WXM localization region for XRF030824
with the 200-inch Hale Telescope and Large-Format Camera on
Mt. Palomar.  Our dithered 4x300s images cover 95% of the
22.4'-diameter error circle at a mean epoch of August 25.25 UT, 0.55
days after the event.  Visual comparison with the Digitized Sky Survey
(POSS-II) reveals no new, bright sources within the localization
region to the limiting magnitude of the GSC catalog, R~18.8.

"The nearest star to the location of the candidate of Moran et
al. (GCN 2363) has R~20.1 in our image."
