K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed a second follow-up observation of the
Fermi/LAT-detected GRB 220107B (Arimoto et al., GCN 31409), ~184 ks after
the trigger. The source suggested to be the X-ray counterpart in GCN 31411
(Gropp et al.) has clearly faded, with a power-law slope of alpha = 1.54
(+0.32, -0.24), and is therefore confirmed as the X-ray afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
