John Mulchaey and Edo Berger (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"On 2005, March 18.995 UT we imaged the BAT error circle of GRB 050318
(GCN 3111) with IMACS on the Magellan/Baade telescope in the R-band.  
Within the 6" radius XRT error circle (GCN 3113) we find a single bright
object which is not present in the DSS at coordinates (J2000):
        RA  =  03:18:51.0
        DEC = -46:23:44
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  We consider this
object to be the optical afterglow of GRB 050318."

[GCN OPS NOTE (19Mar05): Changed the Subject-line from "030518" to "050318".]
