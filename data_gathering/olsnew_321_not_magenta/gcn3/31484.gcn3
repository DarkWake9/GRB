The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-220115A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/31451.gcn3) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2022-01-15 12:03:19.750 UTC to 2022-01-15 12:19:59.750 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event  that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-220115A. We find that these data are consistent with atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 0.013. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220115A is 1.4e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination
with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 8e+04 GeV.

A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2022-01-14 12:11:39.750 UTC to 2022-01-16 12:11:39.750 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 1.00, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220115A is 1.7e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu<mailto:roc@icecube.wisc.edu>.
