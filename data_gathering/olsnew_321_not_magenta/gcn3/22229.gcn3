Using the data set from T-239 to T+400 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 171209A (trigger #796100)
(LaPorte et al., GCN Circ. 22213).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 139.387, -30.523 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  09h 17m 32.8s
  Dec(J2000) = -30d 31' 22.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 61%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts at
~ T-70 s and ends at ~ T+230 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 161.7 +- 30.8 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-70.76 to T+228.44 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.58 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.5 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+79.52 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
