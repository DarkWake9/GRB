M. Nysewander, D. Reichart (U. North Carolina), and M. Schwartz (Tenagra
Observatories) report:

We observed 100% of the 23 arcmin x 13 arcmin error box, but only 90% of
the revised 26 arcmin x 9 arcmin error box, of GRB 021113 (GCN 1686) with
the 32-inch Tenagra II telescope beginning 2.6 hours after the burst.  We
integrated without filter for 1800 seconds per pointing x two pointings.

Visual comparison with the DSS2-Red reveals no obvious counterpart to the
limiting magnitude of the DSS.  Future observations are planned.
