MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) observed
GRB 080205  (GRB_TIME is 08:21:36 UT, Markwardt et al. GCN Circ 7250 ) in 
survey mode (the GRB was at day time for Moscow).
The weather was  good.
We have 31 images   from  16:22:35  to
17:24:46 (481 - 545 minutes   after the GRB time) with mean time:
16  54 UT (513 min  after GRB time).

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).

The robot not find OT brighter then 19.5m  at KAIT's position (Li et 
al., GCN Circ 7251). 
Our limit is agreement with power low line between Li et al.,(GCN 
Circ 7254) and  Rol & Anderson (GCN CIRC 7258) observations.
