SUBJECT: GRB061122: Swift-XRT position

A. P. Beardmore, P. A. Evans, K. L. Page (U Leicester),
S. McBreen (MPE) and D. N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT began observing the field containing the INTEGRAL
burst GRB 061122 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 5834) at 2006-11-22 14:44:38 UT, 
24.47 ks after the trigger. In two orbits of Photon Counting mode data 
totalling 2.35 ks we detect an uncatalogued source at

RA(J2000)  =  20h 15m 19.80s
Dec(J2000) = +15d 31' 03.0"

with an uncertainty of 4.0 arcsec (90% containment, using the updated
boresight file described by Burrows et al. in GCN Circ. 5750). This is
19.8 arcsec from the initial position reported in GCN 5834, and
within the error circle.

The source is presently at an XRT count rate of 0.065 count/s, but at this
stage of the observation it is impossible to say if it is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.

[GCN OPS NOTE(28nov06): Per author's request, the "14:44" was changed to "14:44:38"
and the "24.67 ks" was changed to "24.47 ks".]
