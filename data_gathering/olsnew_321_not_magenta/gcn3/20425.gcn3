K. P. Mooley, R. P. Fender (Oxford), A. Horesh (HUJI) report on behalf 
of a larger collaboration

We observed the optical transient ATLAS17aeu (Tonry et al., LVC GCN 
20382) located in the error region of LIGO/Virgo G268556 (LVC GCN 20364) 
with the AMI Large Array on 2017 Jan 07.04 UT. At 15.5 GHz, the flux 
density of the source is 336+/-20 uJy. We are currently monitoring this 
source.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling this observation. Since this 
source is likely the afterglow of GRB 170105A (e.g. Kasliwal et al., LVC 
GCN 20393; Chambers et al., LVC GCN 20407), we will be updating the 
AMI-GRB database (http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/) with the measurements.
