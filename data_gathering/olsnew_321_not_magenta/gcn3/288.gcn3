K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB Team, and T. Cline, on behalf of
the KONUS-WIND and NEAR GRB teams, report:

An intense, 200 s long burst was observed by Ulysses, KONUS, and
NEAR on 27 April 1999 at 56685 s.  Preliminary triangulation gives
an ~ 70 sq. arcmin. error box whose corners are:

RA(2000)                DEC(2000)

23 h 31 m 07.12 s      -18 o -39' -43"                
23 h 31 m 37.54 s      -18 o -31' -39"           
23 h 30 m 16.68 s      -18 o -43' -23"                
23 h 30 m 47.18 s      -18 o -35' -23" 
 
This error box can be refined.
