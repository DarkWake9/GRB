K. D. Alexander (Harvard), T. Laskar (NRAO / UC Berkeley), E. Berger
(Harvard), and W. Fong (U. Arizona) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed GRB 160117B (Sonbas et al, GCN 18875) at multiple frequencies
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning 2016 January 20.28
UT (2.70 days after the burst). At a mean frequency of 21.8 GHz, we detect
a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~ 0.1 mJy at

RA = 08:48:46.737 +/- 0.5”
Dec = -16:22:00.09 +/- 0.2”

consistent with the enhanced Swift/XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 18880)
and the optical position (Crueler et al,. GCN 18878; Hagen and Sonbas, GCN
18881). Follow-up observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
