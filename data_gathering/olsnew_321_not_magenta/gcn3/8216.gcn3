Alejandro Ferrero (UCD School of Physics), John French (UCD School of
 Physics, DARK/NBI), Gary Melady (UCD School of Physics) report on
 behalf of a larger collaboration:
 
 The Watcher 40 cm robotic telescope at Boyden Observatory, South
 Africa, began imaging the field of GRB 080906 (Vetere et al. GCN 8186)
 at 16:51:15.5 UT, 3.6 h after the Swift triggger. We do not detect the
 afterglow reported by Holland et al. (GCN 8198) and Afonso et al. (GCN
 8194). Our first 120s exposure has a limiting magnitude of 16.9, while
 a stacked sequence of 10 120s images, with an exposure mid-time of 3.8
 hrs after the trigger, results in a limiting magnitude of 18.4.
 Unfiltered magnitudes are transformed to R-band by comparison with the
 USNO-B1 catalog.
