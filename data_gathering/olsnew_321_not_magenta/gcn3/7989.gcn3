C. Guidorzi (INAF-OAB), P. A. Evans and K. L. Page (U Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We note that the correct XRT position of GRB 080721 (Marshall et al.,
GCN Circ. 7988) is that given in sexagesimal coordinates, which
corresponds to RA, Dec 224.48292, -11.72425 degrees (J2000; 4.7 arcsec
radius, 90%) and is also consistent with the UVOT position.
The XRT position given in degrees in the same circular, which has also
been distributed in the XRT position notice, is not correct.
We apologise for any inconvenient this may have caused.
