WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to GRB 200711A (GBM detection:
GCN 28077; Swfit detection: Marshall et al., GCN 28078)
starting at ~0.90 hours after the Swfit trigger, and again
on the second night around 0.81 days after burst. Observations
were performed in the clear (roughly R) filters, and the exposure
time was 20 s per image. We do not detect any optical afterglow
candidate within the enhanced XRT position error circle (Osborne
et al., GCN 28081), neither in the first night image with upper
limit of ~17.5 mag calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog, nor in
the second night co-added image with upper limit of ~20.0 mag.
