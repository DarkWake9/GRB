A low resolution spectrum of the probable host galaxy of GRB 021211 (Fox
& Price, GCN 1731; Crew et al., GCN 1734) was obtained under modest sky
(cirrus) and seeing (between 0.6" and 1.4") conditions, starting on 2003
Jan 8.27, with UT4 (Yepun) + FORS2 at the ESO-VLT. The spectrum covers
the range of wavelengths 6000A-11000A with a resolution of about 17A
(grism 150I). The total exposure time was 4h. We obtained the spectrum
for both the complex afterglow+host and the nearby galaxy 1.5" NE (e.g.
Caldwell et al., GCN 1759), that we confirm to be at z=0.80 (Vreeswijk
et al., GCN 1756 & 1767).

We clearly detect the emission line at 7472.9A already found by
Vreeswijk et al. (GCN 1785). In addition we have identified three
additional emissions at 9722.0A, 9954.9A and 10022.8A. We interpret the
four lines as due to [OII] 3727A, Hbeta and [OIII] at 4959A and 5007A in
the rest frame of the host galaxy, observed at a redshift of
z=1.004+-0.002.


We thank the kind assistance of the staff at Paranal, in particular
Riccardo Scarpa and Andreas Kaufer.
