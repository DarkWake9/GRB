At 05:00:17 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB050726 (trigger=147788).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  But since there was a gap in the TDRSS
coverage at the moment of the burst, the TDRSS messages were lost, and
therefore there were no real-time GCN notifications.  The following comes
from the analysis of the full data set after the regularly scheduled
data downlink pass.  The BAT ground-calculated location is RA,Dec
200.052,-32.072 {13h 20m 12s,-32d 04' 19"} (J2000), with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve
shows a broad weak peak with a hint of structure with a total duration
of ~30 sec (starting before the trigger at ~T-15 extending to ~T+15 sec).
The power law photon index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.04 +- 0.16.
The fluence in the 15-350 keV band are (4.3 +- 0.7) x 10^-6 erg/cm2.   
The 1-s peak photon flux measured from T0+1.0 second in the 15-350 keV  
band is (2.0 +- 0.4) ph/cm2/s.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%  
confidence level. 

An uncatalogued, fading X-ray source was detected by XRT at the following
position: RA,Dec 13h 20m 12.30s -32d 03m 50.8s} (J2000) with an uncertainty
of 6 arcsec (90% containment).  This is 28.4 arcsec from the BAT position
reported above.

The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) observations began
at 05:02:07 UT, 110 seconds after the BAT trigger.  The first data
taken in the V band after the spacecraft settled was a 100 sec exposure 
with the midpoint of the observation at 223 sec after the BAT trigger. 
A comparison against the DSS catalogue reveals a possible new source
inside the BAT and XRT error circles 13h 20m 11.9s,-32d 03' 51.9" (J2000),
although this could also be a known source with a high proper motion.
The V band magnitude was 17.6 +- 0.2.

was changed from "-3d" to "-32d".]
