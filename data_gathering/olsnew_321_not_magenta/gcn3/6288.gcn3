H. Mikuz, J. Skvarc and B. Dintinjana on behalf of PIKA observing program at
Crni Vrh Observatory:

Following the GCN 6270, we performed the analysis of images, obtained with
R and B photometric filters. Photometry results are given in table below.
Time refers to exposure start.

Time (UT)    h  m  s    Exposure (s)  Mag.   Err.  Filter

2007 Apr 11 20:16:00.9     180        19.9   0.7   B
2007 Apr 11 20:21:32.0     180        19.1   0.3   B
2007 Apr 11 20:27:03.0     180        19.3   0.3   B
2007 Apr 11 20:32:33.9     180        19.9   0.6   B
2007 Apr 11 20:38:04.6     180        not detected B
2007 Apr 11 20:43:35.3     180        not detected B

The magnitudes are derived using comparison stars from the USNO-B1
catalogue. The 3-sigma limiting magnitude in R filter is around magnitude
19.8, and about 20.0 in B filter. Fits images are available at
