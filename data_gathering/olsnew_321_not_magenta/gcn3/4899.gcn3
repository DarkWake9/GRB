A. Pereyra and A. M. Magalhães (IAG, Univ. of São Paulo) report: 

We obtained optical imaging of GRB 060218/SN 2006aj (Cusumano et al., GCN 4775) on  
2006/March 3.958 (UT) using the IAG-USP 60cm telescope at the Laboratório Nacional de 
Astrofísica (LNA), Brazil. The observation was made under poor sky conditions and 
through high airmass (>2). A 90-second exposure in the I filter yielded I = (17.06 +/- 
0.10) mag. The zero point calibration was obtained using comparison stars in the GRB 
field from Hicken et al. (GCN 4898) and Modjaz et al. (astro-ph/0603377).
