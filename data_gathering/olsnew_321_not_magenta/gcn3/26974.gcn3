report on behalf of SRG/ART-XC team:

The SRG/ART-XC telescope crossed the GBM localization region of
GRB200120A (GCN26831) and its IPN triangulation (GCN26856)
several times after the event. The first pass was approximately
800 seconds after the event time and covered the sky region between
lines defined by two pairs of the RA, DEC (J2000) coordinates:
1st (142.420, -69.397) , (130.997, -70.584);
2nd (147.762, -69.996) , (130.734, -71.192).
This region has approximately 60% cross section area with the IPN
triangulation. We do not detect with ART-XC any source around
the GRB200120A position with the upper limit, averaged over FoV,
of ~2e-11 ergs/s/cm2 in the 4-12 keV energy band neither in this
pass nor in subsequent ones Â followed every 4 hours during next
few days.
