M. Uemura, A. Arai, O. Nagae, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.),
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We started optical imaging of the field of GRB070810B (GCN 6743) 
at 15:22:37 UT 10 Aug. using TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 
1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan.  
Exposure times are 30 sec for the first 10 frames, then changed 
to 123 sec for late frames.  

We have performed preliminary analysis for the first 30-min images.
No new bright object was detected.  There is no object showing
significant fadings. 
Limit magnitudes are estimated from neighbour USNO A2.0 stars as 
follows:

10 Aug. UT  limit mag.  band
15:33:22    20.8        Rc
15:55:04    20.9        Rc

We note that there is a possible minor planet at RA=00:35:59.3, 
Dec=+08:50:15 (time=15:33:22 UT).  The object is about Rc=20.1,
and moving northward during our observations.
