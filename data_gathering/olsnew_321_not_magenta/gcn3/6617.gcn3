We observed the field of GRB 070704 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 6594) with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakyrlytepe,TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey). The observations consisted of a series 30-second
exposures in g',r',i' filters, until ~1h after the burst time we
continue only r'-filter exposures. The first exposure in g' started at
20:15:13.9UT, i.e.556 s after the BAT trigger. The observations were
finished ~1.5 hour after the burst time.

In 30-second images as well as in combined images we do not detect any
new object at the revised XRT position (Godet & Sakamoto, GCN 6598) down
to following limiting magnitudes:
