D. A. Frail (NRAO) and E. Berger (Caltech) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"On 2002, October 05.29 UT we observed the position of the optical
afterglow candidate reported by D. Fox (GCN 1564) with the VLA at 22.5
GHz (1.3 cm). With a quick-look reduction we detect a 0.6 mJy radio
source coincident with the position of the optical source. Further
observations with the VLA are planned."
