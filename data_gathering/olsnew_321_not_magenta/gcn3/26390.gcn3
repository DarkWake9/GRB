We report the results of the observation of the field of the gravitational
wave event S191204r (GCN circular #26334) obtained with the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST) equipped with Omegacam (described in GCN 26334, Proposal
ID ESO 0104.D-0049).

Images were analised using our image difference pipelines (Brocato et al.
2018 MNRAS, 474,1).
As reference images we used DECAM archive images retrieved from
https://datalab.noao.edu/sia/des_dr1.
The final vetting was done via visual inspection.
We detected the following three interesting candidates:

Name   |  RA                | Dec            |      MJD     | Mag

VSTJ044435.43-332755.7 | 04:44:35.432 | -33:27:55.69 | 58222.081 | 21.5 +/-
0.1
VSTJ051111.58-373132.0 | 05:11:11.576 | -37:31:32.04 | 58822.079 | 20.6 +/-
0.1
VSTJ051052.17-335413.9 | 05:10:52.168 | -33:54:13.95 | 58823.140 | 22.2 +/-
0.2

The transients were detected at multiple epochs. Here we report epoch and
magnitude for the brightest detection.

All the transients appear projected near a galaxy. In particular
GWd_S191205r_12093 is located 7.4 arcsec from the nucleus of GLADE131392
which distance is 178Mpc (GLADE catalog).
The small distance appears to exclude that this transient is related to
the GW event.
