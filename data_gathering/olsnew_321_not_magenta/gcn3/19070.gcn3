The short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 160219A
(IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN 19035;
Fermi-GBM detection: Yu & Roberts, GCN 19041)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=24973.245 s UT (06:56:13.245).

The burst light curve starts with a short (~0.09 s) pulse,
followed by a weaker pulse at ~T0+3.1 s (with a duration of~0.96 s).

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB160219_T24973/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
1.57(-0.21,+0.25)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak flux,
measured from ~T0-0.028 s, of 1.22(-0.27,+0.27)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Since the bulk of the burst emission was detected before
the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modelling the K-W 3-channel spectrum of the first pulse
(measured from T0-0.066 s to T0+0.022 s)
by the cutoff power law yields the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.29(-0.37,+0.55),
and the peak energy Ep = 753(-187,+395) keV.

Modelling the K-W 3-channel spectrum of the second pulse
(measured from T0+3.072 s to T0+4.032 s)
by the cutoff power law yields the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.98(-0.22,+0.73),
and a lower limit on the Ep: Ep > 760 keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
