K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 The error region of Swift GRB 050922B (Norris et al. GCN 4008) was
observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope. BVRcIc imaging
started at 2005 September 22, 15:07:42 UT (342 s after the trigger)
and 60 s integration was repeated.

 Due to low transparency and intermittent clouds, useful images were
obtained after 15:16:47 UT. Preliminary analysis gives the following
3-sigma upper limits for an optical counterpart of the Swift XRT
afterglow (GCN 4008).
