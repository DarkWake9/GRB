TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3302
SUBJECT: GRB050421

The field of GRB050421 (GCN 3296, using the updated position
in GCN 3301) was observed with the Ryle Telescope in Cambridge 
at 15 GHz from 08:37 to 12:12 UT on 2005 Apr 21 (4h25m to 8h
after the trigger). The angular resolution is 25".

A formal measure of the flux density at the position in GCN 3301 
is 0.59 mJy with an rms noise 0.27 mJy, and is therefore not
a convincing detection.

This message is quotable.
