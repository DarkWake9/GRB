report:

The short-duration GRB 200407A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 27502)
has been detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 607933326) and
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 22921 s UT (06:22:01).

We have triangulated it to a GBM-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=217.298 deg (14h 29m 12s)  Dec(2000)=+55.704 deg (+55d 42' 15"),
whose radius is 66.821 +/- 4.108 deg (3 sigma).

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi-GBM one.

This localization may be improved.
