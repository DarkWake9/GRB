and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 181008B was detected by
Fermi (GBM; trigger 560725347), Konus-Wind, Swift (BAT)
and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), at about 75743 s UT (21:02:23).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=173.995 deg (11h 35m 59s)  Dec(2000)=+4.777 deg (+4d 46' 38"), 
whose radius is 70.040 +/- 2.099 deg (3 sigma).

The annulus combined with the Fermi-GBM final position
3 sigma error circle gives the following error box:
---------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg   Dec(2000), deg
---------------------------------
  Center:
    112.6582      -35.4039
  Corners:
    110.7043      -23.9434
    105.1913      -20.9537
    119.7336      -50.4173
    121.7709      -44.6724
--------------------------------
The error box area is 116 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 31.6 deg (the minimum one is 4.2 deg).
The Sun distance was about 62 deg.

This box may be improved.

This box was submitted for observation by the MASTER-Net robotic
telescope network (http://observ.pereplet.ru; Lipunov et al., 2010,
Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L).

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
