Jesper Nielsen (DARK/Sindal School), Brian L. Jensen, Johan P. U. Fynbo,
Jens Hjorth (DARK Cosmology Centre), Christoffer Karoff (IFA/U. of
Aarhus) report on behalf or a larger collaboration:

"Using DFOSC on the Danish 1.5m telescope at La Silla, we have obtained
R-band imaging of the field of the Integral-detected GRB060130
(Mereghetti et al., GCN #4615) starting at Jan 30.375 (4.5h after the
trigger). Visual comparison with the DSS-2 does not reveal any transient
sources brighter than the DSS-2 limit. Our image reaches a detection limit
slightly deeper than R=22.

Our R-band image of the field can be seen at this URL:
