Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120202A detected by INTEGRAL
(trigger 6461) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 20s after the GRB trigger
(14s after the notice). The burst was still active.
The elevation of the field increased from 9 degrees
above horizon and weather conditions were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+20s to t0+80s : R > 15.2

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+96s to t0+126s : R > 15.9

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+96s to t0+287s : R > 17.2

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=11.1564 lat=+79.4238
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.05 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
