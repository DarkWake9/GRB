During the commissioning phase, at 2017-07-05T02:45:59.00 (T0),
Insight-HXMT detected GRB 170705A (trigger ID: HEB170705115)
in a routine search of the data, which was also observed by
the Swift/BAT (Starling et al. 2017, GCN 21289), Fermi/GBM
(Bissaldi et al. 2017, GCN 20297) and Konus-Wind (Svinkin et al. 2017,
GCN 21299).

The Insight-HXMT light curve consists of single pulse
with a duration (T90) of 7.0 s measured from T0-1.30 s.
The 1-second peak rate, measured from T0+1 s, is 928.3 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 3458 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors in the energy range
of about 80-840 keV (record energy) in the regular mode. Only gamma-rays 
with
energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the spacecraft and leave
signals in the CsI detectors installed on the inside of the telescope.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2 s to T0+8 s is
adequately fit by a Power Law model with spectral index = -2.16 +/- 0.10.
The energy fluence is (1.42 +/- 0.30)E-05 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 5000 keV
in this time interval.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
