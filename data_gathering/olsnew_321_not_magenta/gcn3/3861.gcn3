Atish Kamble (Raman Research Institute [RRI], Bangalore, India),
C. H. Ishwara Chandra (NCRA, Pune, India) and D. Bhattacharya (RRI)
report on behalf of a larger GRB collaboration :

We observed the field of XRF 050509c (GCN 3402, GCN 3425, GCN 3543)
on Jul. 6.56 (UT) and on Aug 4.48 (UT) with the Giant Meterwave Radio
Telescope (GMRT), India at 1280 MHz using a bandwidth of 32 MHz.

We do not detect any source coincident with the position of radio
afterglow reported by Cameron and Soderberg (GCN 3543).

The two sigma upper limits are as follows:

Jul. 6.56 (UT) : 0.22 mJy
Aug  4.48 (UT) : 0.12 mJy

We thank GMRT and the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) staff.
This TOO was done under the GMRT Director's Discretionary Time.
GMRT is run by NCRA-TIFR, Pune (INDIA).
