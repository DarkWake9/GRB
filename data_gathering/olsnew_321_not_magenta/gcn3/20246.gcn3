and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 161207A (Fermi-GBM trigger #502836132) triggered
the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 20:43:00.39 on 7 December 2016.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows several overlapping peaks.  The entire
burst episode starts at T-20 sec, peaks at T+5 sec and ends at T+30 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 32.8 +- 1.7 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
