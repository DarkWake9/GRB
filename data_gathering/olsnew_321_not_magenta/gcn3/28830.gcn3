report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:00:56.75 UT on 4 November 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201104A (trigger 626140861 / 201104001,
which was also detected by the Fermi-LAT (Ohno et al. 2020, GCN 28828) 
and AGILE (Ursi et al. 2020, GCN 28829).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 57 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a bright emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 8.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+9 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 1140 +/- 130 keV,
alpha = -0.76 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.24 +/- 0.17.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.55 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 in the 10-1000 keV band
is 12.1 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
