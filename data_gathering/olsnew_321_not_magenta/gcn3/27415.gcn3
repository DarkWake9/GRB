The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:44:40 UT on 19 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200319A (trigger 606296685.320018 / 200319323).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 63.8, Dec = -20.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 15m, -20d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 97.0 degrees.
