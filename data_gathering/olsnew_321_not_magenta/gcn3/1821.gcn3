We have imaged the optical afterglow of the GRB 021211 (Fox & Price, GCN
1531; Crew et al., GCN 1734) on different epochs, using the Italian 3.6m
TNG telescope, equipped with OIG, and the 8.2m ESO-VLT-UT4 (Yepun)
equipped with FORS2, in the R-band filter. In the VLT images we clearly
detect a point-like source at the position of the afterglow.
Our results are reported in the following table:

UT              exposure  Telescope  seeing  R magnitude
--------------------------------------------------------
2002 Dec 27.09  70 min    3.6m TNG   1.0"    > 25.0
2003 Jan  9.30  33 min    8.2m VLT   0.6"    24.1 +- 0.2
2003 Jan 10.23  30 min    8.2m VLT   1.2"    24.5 +- 0.2
2003 Jan 14.33  15 min    8.2m VLT   0.8"    24.6 +- 0.1

The first value is a 3-sigma upper limit and it assumes a point-like
source. Errors for the other observations are 1-sigma. Some cirrus were
present during the Jan 9 exposure.

Our dataset confirms the flattening in the light curve found by HST
(Fruchter et al., GCN 1781). The VLT measurements do not indicate
significant variability, and are also consistent with the HST ACS F606W
measurement.

We thank the ESO Director and the ESO staff at Garching for promptly
considering our DDT proposal. We also thank the personnel at TNG (in
particular Massimo Cecconi, Juan Carlos Guerra and Marco Pedani) and at
Paranal (in particular Andreas Kaufer and Nancy Ageorges).
