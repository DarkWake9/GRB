P Veres (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:43:53.61 UT on 01 January 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160101A (trigger 473301837 / 160101030)
which was also detected by MAXI/GSC (Itoh et al., GCN 18793)
and Swift/XRT (Izzo et al., GCN 18795).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the MAXI and Swift positions.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 93 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 4.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+7.3 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 135.0 +/- 5.2 keV,
alpha = -0.78 +/- 0.03, and beta = -2.26 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.682 +/- 0.024)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 35.7 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
