At 05:35:27.809 UTC on 8 March 2022, the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) triggered on a long weak GRB followed in ~460 s by the bright
GRB 220308A, localized by the IPN (Svinkin et al., GCN 31715;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/220308A.gcn3).
Both bursts were seen by all CGBM detectors.
The first (trigger) burst might be a precursor of GRB 220308A.

The trigger burst light curve shows a double-peaked pulse which starts at
T+1.9 sec, peaks at T+3.6 sec,and ends at T+15.0 sec. The T90 and T50
durations measured by the SGM data are 11.6 +- 1.6 sec and 7.4 +- 1.6 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.
The GRB 220308A light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T+461.6 sec, peaks at T+465.9 sec, and ends at T+481.9 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 15.4 +- 0.4 sec
and 4.0 +- 0.1 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
