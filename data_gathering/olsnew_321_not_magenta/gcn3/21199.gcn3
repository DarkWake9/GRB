MASTER Kislovodsk was observed Swift Trigger 755873 since 62 sec to 2957 
sec after  trigger time in SWIFT error box (K.L. Page et al., GCN # 
21193). MASTER -IAC and MASTER-Kislovodsk had credible conditions
for observations.

MASTER-Kislovodsk was pointed to the 
Swift Trigger 755873 12 sec after notice time and 62 sec after trigger 
time at 
2017-06-04 21:31:54 UT. On our first (10s exposure)  set we haven`t found 
optical transient  within SWIFT error-box.

The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.9mag . This limit in agreement 
with Jelinek et al. (GCN  #21194)

The observations made on zenit distance = 38 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
53 degree.
The moon (81 % bright part) is 20 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 69. The sun  altitude  is -23.5 degree.
The object can be observed till sunrise at 2017-06-05 01:28:56 .

MASTER-IAC  robotic telescope located in IAC was pointed to the Swift 
Trigger 755873 1001 sec after notice time and 1051 sec after trigger
time at 2017-06-04 22:05:58 UT.

The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 20.2 mag

The observations made on zenit distance = 36 degrees, galaxy latitude b = 
53 degree.
The moon (82 % bright part) is 56 degrees above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object is 69
The sun  altitude  is -23.6 degree.
The object can be observed till sunrise at 2017-06-05 06:07:42.

All our observations are in agreement with Ondrejov Robotic Telescope 
Limit  (Jelinek et al. GCN  #21194 ).
