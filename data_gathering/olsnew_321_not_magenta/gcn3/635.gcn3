TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  635
SUBJECT: X-ray burst or X-ray rich GRB 000416 observed by BeppoSAX
DATE:    00/04/17 18:36:17 GMT
FROM:    SAX Science Operations at IAS/CNR Frascati  <saxsci@ias.rm.cnr.it>

On April 16 at 14:32:54 UT a burst was detected in WFC n.2 
with a peak flux of about 2 Crab in the 2-26 keV range.
The burst lasted about 25 s. 
Preliminary position is:

R.A.= 258.76

Decl.= -71.56

with an error radius of 4'.

We name the source 1SAXJ1715.0-7134.

A marginal detection of the burst in the GRBM (40-700 keV) would lead to
classify the event as an X-Ray rich GRB, although we could not exclude a 
type I X-ray burster on the basis of the WFC hardness ratio.
A fast TOO observation was technically feasible but we could not perform
it because of budget reduction of BeppoSAX operations (see GCN n.634)
