report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 11:18:55.91 on September, 05, 2016 Fermi-LAT detected
high-energy emission from GRB 160905*A*, which was also
detected by Swift (GCN 19887) and Fermi-GBM
(trigger 494767139/160905471; GCN 19889).

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in
the event rate that is spatially and temporally correlated
with the trigger with high significance.

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be
RA, Dec = 162.02, -50.88 (J2000)
with an error radius of 0.08 deg (90 % containment, statistical error 
only).

This was 18 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

The highest-energy photon is a *8 GeV* event which was
observed *350* seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is *

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an 
international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
