and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 160118A (Fermi-GBM trigger #474773146; INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7343) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 01:25:56.90 on 18 January 2016.  
The burst signal was detected by all instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a several spikes.  The emission starts at T0-20 sec, 
peaks at T0+5 sec and ends at T0+80 sec.   The T90 duration measured by the SGM data 
is 31.0 s ± 1.4 sec (40-230 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
