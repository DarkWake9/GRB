the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:15:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191106A (trigger=933515).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 269.350, +46.052, which is 
   RA(J2000)c =  17h 57m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 03' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a few peaks
with a total duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 14:16:34.2 UT, 70.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 269.3349,
46.0346 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 57m 20.38s
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 02' 04.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 73 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (4.38 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4
(+4.05/-3.32) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
130 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.2 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.06.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
