The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely Long GRB.

At 09:17:15.73 UT on 27 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220527A (trigger 675335840 / 220527387).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 323.8, DEC = -10.6 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 21 h 35 m, -10 d 34 '), with a statistical uncertainty
of 1 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 43
degrees.
