We report the discovery of a rising radio source detected with the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) within the 95% localisation volume
of S190814bv (GCN 25324). The observations were conducted at a frequency of
943 MHz on 2019-08-16 and 2019-08-23 (see GCN 25445 and GCN 25472 for details).

We searched for sources with a rising flux density between the two observations
that are spatially coincident with known galaxies selected from the GLADE
catalogue (DÃ¡lya et al. 2018). One candidate is ASKAP 005547-270433, reported
as AT2019osy on the Transient Name Server, at
    RA = 00:55:47,
    Dec = -27:04:33,
offset ~1 arcsecond from 2dFGRS TGS211Z177.

ASKAP 005547-270433 has a 943 MHz integrated flux density of 376 +/- 33 uJy
in epoch 1 and 550 +/- 34 uJy in epoch 2. The redshift of 2dFGRS TGS211Z177
is 0.0738, which is consistent with the luminosity distance of S190814bv
(270+/-50 Mpc, GCN 25324).

Further analysis of these ASKAP observations are ongoing and future
epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
