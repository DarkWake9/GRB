E. Berger and M. Lopez-Morales (Carnegie) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the XRT error circle (GCN 3636) of GRB 050717 (GCN 3633) with
the Wide-Field Infrared Camera on the du Pont 100-inch telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory on 2005 July 19.01 UT (37.7 hours after the burst) in
K-band.  A total of 810 seconds were obtained in good seeing conditions.  
Within the 6-arcsec radius XRT error circle we find 4 sources of which one
is also visible in 2MASS K-band images.  The other three sources have
magnitudes of 18.1, 18.7, and 19.2 in comparison to several 2MASS stars;
the 3-sigma limiting magnitude of our image is about 19.4.  At this point
we do not have any evidence for fading in any of the three sources.  
Further observations are planned."
