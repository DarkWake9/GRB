At 10:51:20 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 051117 (trigger=164268).
The spacecraft slewed immediately.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA,Dec 228.405d, +30.870d {+15h 13m 37s, +30d 52' 11"} (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows a single peak with a total duration
of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~3 sec after the trigger.

XRT began observing at 10:53:07 UT, 107 seconds after the BAT trigger. 
We find a bright, rapidly fading, uncataloged source at RA 15h 13m 33.7s 
Dec +30d 52' 22.0" (J2000) with a positional uncertainty of 5.8 arcsec
(90% containment).  This is 46 arcsec from the BAT position.  The 
approximate initial flux is 1.0e-8 erg/cm2/sec (0.2-10 keV).  The XRT
preliminary raw spectrum is well fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a
photon index of 2.2+/- 0.1 with an excess NH of 2e21 cm^-2.

UVOT began observing at UT 10:53:10, 111 seconds after the BAT trigger.
In a 200 sec V image, we detect a faint source just outside the XRT 
error circle at an approximate position of RA=15h 13m 33.6s, Dec=30d 52' 15.2"
(J2000) that is not present in the DSS.  The magnitude is 19.9 mag.
The extinction in this direction is A_V = 0.08.
