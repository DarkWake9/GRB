S.Dichiara (UMD, NASA-GSFC), B. O'Connor (GWU, UMD) , E. Troja (UMD,
NASA-GSFC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 200522A (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 27778) with
the Gemini North telescope beginning 2020-05-24 14:36:32  UT, approximately
2.12 days post-burst. We obtained 7x90s exposures in r-band performed with
poor weather conditions and at an airmass of 2.9.

We measure an AB magnitude of r=21.37 +/- 0.10 for the putative host galaxy
(Fong et al., GCN Circ. 27779; Strausbaugh et al., GCN Circ. 27792).

No other object is detected within the enhanced Swift-XRT position
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 27780) down to a 3-sigma limit r>22.3 AB.
Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and not corrected for
Galactic extinction.

Further observations are on-going.

A Chandra ToO has been approved for this burst.

We thank the Gemini North staff for efficiently executing these
observations in these difficult times.
