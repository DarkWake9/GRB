P. D'Avanzo, S. R. Oates (U. of Warwick), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. A. Evans (U. Leicester), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), J. L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift team: 

We have analysed 1.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 161014A (Racusin et al. GCN Circ. 20035), from 108 s to 5.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 48 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. Using 1696 s of PC mode data and 4 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 332.64764, +7.46858 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 22h 10m 35.43s
Dec(J2000): +07d 28' 06.9"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

UVOT took a settling exposure of 9.8 seconds with the v filter starting 109 seconds after the BAT trigger. We find a source consistent with the position of the afterglow  reported by MITSuME (Morita et al GCN Circ 20036) and LCOGT FTS (Guidorzi et al., GCN Circ. 20037). The estimated magnitude is 16.52. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.08 in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
