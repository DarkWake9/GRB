report:

The HETE FREGATE, WXM, and SXC instruments detected GRB 041211 (=H3622)
at 11:31:47 UT (41507 SOD) on 11 December 2004.  No prompt location was
issued because of a lack of real-time spacecraft aspect information.
Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a location that was reported
in a GCN Notice issued at 12:51:48 UT.  This localization can be
expressed as a circle of 8 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) that is
centered at

WXM-Ground:  RA = 06h 43m 53s, DEC =  +20d 20' 17" (J2000).

The WXM location was further refined, resulting in a new location that
was reported in a GCN Notice at 11:31:47 UT.  This localization can be
expressed as a circle of 8.6 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) that
is centered at

WXM-Ground:  RA = 06h 43m 27s, DEC =  +20d 19' 58" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data resulted in a location that was issued
in the same Notice as the refined WXM localization.  This localization
can be expressed as a circle of 80 arcseconds radius that is centered
at

SXC-Ground:  RA = 06h 43m 12s, DEC =  +20d 23' 42" (J2000).

The burst has a duration > 100 s.  Preliminary spectral analyses show
the 2-30 keV fluence of GRB 041211 to be 2.4 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and the
30-400 keV fluence to be 1.0 x 10-5 ergs cm-2.  Therefore GRB 041211 is
a classical "hard" GRB.  The empirical redshift indicator for this
burst gives a pseudoZ~3.0.
