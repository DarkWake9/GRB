P. A. Evans (U Leicester), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:00:30 UT, BAT triggered on a possible GRB at
RA, dec = 238.036, +27.578 (J2000). 

However, due to a TDRSS telemetry gap, no further 
data is available at this time. 

No XRT source was detected in 90 s of downlinked data taken approximately 1.5ks
after the trigger time. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise 
the XRT counterpart. 

No UVOT data is available at this time. 

The full data set will be available following the next ground pass. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. R. Cummings (jayc AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
