S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), P. A. Evans (U Leicester),
F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), P. Schady (MSSL), and R. Margutti (U
Bicocca & OAB) report on the behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

      We confirm the optical afterglow of GRB 081126 reported by
Sergeev & Pozanenko (2008, GCN Circ. 8558). A re-examination of the
UVOT data shows that there is a fading source at

      RA (J2000)  21:34:03.59  =  323.51496 (deg)
     Dec (J2000) +48:42:38.3   =  +48.71064 (deg)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence,
statistical + systematic).  This is consistent with the XRT error
circle.  Preliminary photometry and 3-sigma upper limits for this
source are

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction along the line of sight corresponding to a
reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.78 mag (Schlegel, et al., 1998, ApJS, 500,
525).  All photometry is on the UVOT photometric system described in
Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).  The detection in the u filter,
combined with the lack of detections in the UV filters, is consistent
with the afterglow having a redshift of approximately 2.4 < z < 3.8.
However, this result is uncertain due to the large Galactic reddening
along the line of sight to this source.

      The source identified in Holland & Margutti 2008, (GCN
Circ. 8559) as being possibly extended is consistent with the
catalogued position of the 2MASS point source 21340333+4842361.  The
separation between this 2MASS source and the afterglow is 3.2 arcsec.
Since the photometry of the 2MASS source and the afterglow are
consistent with both sources having at the same redshift it is
possible that the 2MASS source is the host galaxy.  Further
observations are encouraged to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

      Holland & Margutti 2008, (GCN Circ. 8559) misidentified the
optical afterglow as as the 2MASS point source 21340333+4842361.  We
apologize for any confusion caused by the misidentification in the
previous UVOT Circular on GRB 081126.
