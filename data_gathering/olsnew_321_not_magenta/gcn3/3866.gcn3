At 23:12:16 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB050824 (trigger=151905).
This was a 64-sec image trigger.  The spacecraft did not automatically slew
due to proximity to the moon (25 degrees).  Hence there will be no immediate
results from XRT or UVOT.  However, a TOO is being planned for this target.
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 12.237d,+22.592d
{00h 48m 57s,+22d 35' 31"} (J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).  The BAT light curve shows a broad peak
from T+30 to T+70 sec.  The emission is present only in the 15-50 keV band.
The peak count rate was ~500 counts/sec (15-50 keV) at ~40 seconds
after the trigger.  At this early stage of the analysis we think this is
likely a GRB, as there is no known gamma-ray source at this location
in the SIMBAD database and the galactic latitude is -40 degrees.
