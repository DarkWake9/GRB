GRB010222: BeppoSAX/NFI Observations

A BeppoSAX TOO observation of GB010222 has started about 9
hours after the GRB.
A preliminary analysis of MECS(1.6-10 keV) image of the first orbit shows
a bright unknown source in the WFC error circle.

The position is:

RA(2000) = 223.052
Delta(2000) = 43.012

The error radius is 1 arcminute.

This source is consistent with the detected optical transient (GCN 962
and 963).
