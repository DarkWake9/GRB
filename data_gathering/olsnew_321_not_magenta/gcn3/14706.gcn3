A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC, UPV-EHU), A.
Guijarro (CAHA) and M. Jelínek (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB 130527A by Swift (Gompertz et al. GCNC
14703), follow-up observations have been conducted with the 0.6m TELMA
telescope (+ COLORES, i'-band) at the BOOTES-2 station in Málaga and with
the 3.5m CAHA (+ Omega2000, zYJHK) at the German-Spanish Calar Alto
Observatory. Data was gathered starting at 2:30 UT (i.e. ~12.1 hr post
burst), at high airmass and with the moon only 11 degrees away. At the
position of the X-ray afterglow (Evans et al. GCNC 14705), no optical/nIR
source is detected down to J ~ 20. Further data analysis is ongoing."
