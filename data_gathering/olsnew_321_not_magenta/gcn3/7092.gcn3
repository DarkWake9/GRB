SUBJECT: GRB 071112C: WSRT Radio Observations

A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC) and R.A.M.J. Wijers (University of Amsterdam)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 071112C afterglow at 4.9 GHz with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at November 14 16.61 UT to November 15
4.60 UT, i.e. 1.92 - 2.42 days after the burst (GCN 7059).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 7059). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around that position is
93 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for a point source at
the position of the optical counterpart is 44 +/- 31 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
