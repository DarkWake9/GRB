Using the data set from T-239.0 to T+595.8 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061004 (trigger #232339)  
(Ziaeepour, et
al., GCN Circ. 5691).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec = 
97.795,
-45.903 deg {6h 31m 10.8s, -45d 54' 9.8"} (J2000) +- 0.8 arcmin, (radius,
sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 98%.

The light curve shows a single peak, extending out to T+8 seconds.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.2 +- 0.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.2 to T+8.1 is best fit by a simple 
power-law
model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.81 +- 0.10.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 0.3 x 10-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.67 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 2.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
