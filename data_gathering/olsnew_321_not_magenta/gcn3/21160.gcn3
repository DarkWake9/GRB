collaboration:

We report results of photometric observations and possible 
classifications of Pan-STARRS1 transients PS17dp, PS17fl, PS17fn, PS17gl 
(Smartt et al, GCN 20410) detected  in  the LIGO G268556 localizations 
(LIGO Scientific Collaboration, GCN 20364). Observations were conducted 
using telescopes/observatories AZT-33IK/Mondy and  Zeiss-1000/TSHAO.

PS17dp	
RA   09:00:51.09
Dec +45:26:44.3

We observed the source PS17dp taking 5 observational sets in different 
epochs between Jan. 19 and 24. All observations were performed with 
filter R. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-01-24	21:17:52	R	57777.89783	17.02	0.04

The source is fading during our observations. There is an SDSS galaxy 
J090050.96+452642.7 at the position of the source with r = 17.280 +/- 
0.006 and R = 17.050 +/- 0.015 (Lupton 2005 transformation equations) 
which might be a host galaxy of the transient. At the last observational 
epoch the source faded to the host galaxy level within 1 sigma.

PS17fl	
RA   08:02:09.73
Dec +28:49:44.7

We observed the source PS17fl taking 9 observational sets in different 
epochs between January 17 and March 28. All observations were performed 
with filter R.  The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-03-28	17:18:32	R	57840.73404	18.22	0.03

The brightness of the source slowly decreases and in our last 
observational set has a magnitude consistent within 2 sigma with that of 
its host galaxy SDSS J080209.69+284945.3 (Chambers  et al. GCN 20437) 
with r = 18.47 +/- 0.01 and R = 18.29 +/- 0.02 (Lupton 2005 
transformation equations). If SN Ib/Ic (suggested by Chambers  et al. 
GCN 20437) then maximum can be between MJD 57761.4876 and  57770.69727 
and therefore could be related to G268556 event.

PS17fn	
RA   08:05:51.40
Dec +28:42:51.9

We observed the source PS17fn taking 8 observational sets in different 
epochs between Jan. 17 and 28. All observations were performed with 
filter R.   The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-01-28	19:15:36	R	57781.80806	19.31	0.07

There is an SDSS galaxy J080209.69+284945.3 at the position of the 
source with r = 19.801 +/- 0.032 and R = 19.612 +/- 0.063 (Lupton 2005 
transformation equations) which might be a host galaxy of the transient. 
The source is rising above the host level for more then 3 sigma, than 
fading.The photometry of the source might be contaminated by a nearby 
galaxy J080551.85+284253.6 in 6 arcseconds to the East of the source. 
The temporal behavior of the transient allows to confirm it to be a 
supernova (Chambers  et al. 20437) with the maximum around of MJD = 
57774.68807 and therefore the source is inconsistent with the G268556 
trigger.

PS17gl	
RA   08:34:50.85
Dec +61:13:02.2

We observed the source PS17fl taking 5 observational sets in different 
epochs between Jan. 19 and 25. All observations were performed with 
filter R. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-01-25	18:51:56	R	57778.79509	17.57	0.02

There is an SDSS galaxy J083450.96+611258.7 at the position of the 
source with r = 17.704 +/- 0.009 and R = 17.502 +/- 0.020 (Lupton 2005 
transformation equations) which might be a host galaxy of the transient. 
The source is fading during our observations down to the level of the 
host galaxy within 2 sigma. This may be a supernova or a GRB afterglow.
