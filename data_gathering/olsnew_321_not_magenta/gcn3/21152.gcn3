We observed the field of GRB 170524A (Gropp, et al., GCN 21135) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/05 25.40 to 2017/05 25.46 UTC (13.79 to
15.29 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.06 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.36 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

We again observed from 2017/05 26.32 to 2017/05 26.47 UTC (35.77 to 39.48
hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.42 hours exposure in
the r and i bands and 1.01 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans, et al., GCN 21136),
in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
upper limits (3-sigma):

     5/25      5/26
  r  > 24.45   > 25.66
  i  > 23.25   > 24.52
  Z  > 21.72   > 23.00
  Y  > 21.26   > 22.57
  J  > 18.16   > 21.25
  H  > 17.83   > 21.50

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
