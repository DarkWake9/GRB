Swift Team:

At 07:17:20 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140206A (trigger=585834).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 145.350, +66.750 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 41m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = +66d 45' 01"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~19000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~60 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:18:04.0 UT, 43.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 145.33438, 66.76074 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 09h 41m 20.25s
   Dec(J2000) = +66d 45' 38.7"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 44 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 4.79
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 9.62e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT results are not available at this time.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
