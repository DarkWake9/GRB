SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, RHESSI, Mars Odyssey-HEND and GRS, and INTEGRAL
(SPI-ACS) observed this GRB at 54424 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses,
it had a duration of approximately  20 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  5.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
1.2E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA,
Decl(2000)=342.570, -21.977, whose radius is 60.225 +/- 0.014 degrees
(3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as Ulysses, Earth,
and Mars are practically aligned, a small error box cannot be derived
for this event.
