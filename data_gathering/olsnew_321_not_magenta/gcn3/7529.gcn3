   We took a series of I-band and z-band images of GRB080325,
  using the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US)
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute.
   The z-band observation started at March 27, 08:46:06 UT
  (2.19223 days after the burst) and the I-band observation
  started at March 27, 10:41:05 UT (2.27208 days after the burst).

   We do not find an optical counterpart at the location of
  the NIR afterglow candidate reported by Tanaka et al. (GCN 7524),
  in both I and z-band stacked images.
   We set the limit of the GRB afterglow as I > 21.2 mag (3-sigma),
  calibrated with a USNO-B star at (18:31:36.3, 36:31:51.0).

   The afterglow candidate reported by Updike et al. (GCN 7515)
  is detected at both I- and z-bands, with the I-band magnitude
  of I=19.0 +- 0.1 mag, calibrated with the same star as above.
   However, we note that this object is also visible in the DSS
  image (POSS-II), and therefore it is unlikely to be a GRB afterglow.

   We thank the LOAO operator, I. Baek for her assistance for this
  observation.
