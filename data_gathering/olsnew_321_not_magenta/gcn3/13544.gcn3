TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13544
SUBJECT: GRB 120729A: UKIRT Observation
DATE:    12/07/30 14:05:05 GMT
FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

Myungshin Im and Jueun Hong (CEOU/Seoul National Univ.) on behalf of 
a larger collaboration.

We observed GRB 120729A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 13530) in
ZYJHK using WFCAM on UKIRT.

The observation started at 2012-07-29 13:01:41 UT, 
or about 2.09 hours after the BAT alert. 
In all of the ZYJHK images, we identify the afterglow
(H ~ 18.0 AB mag) which was reported earlier by several groups 
(Virgili et al. GCN 13531; Oates et al. GCN 13539).
We also confirm fading of the object from another set of
WFCAM data we took about 3 hours later.

Further observations are planned.
