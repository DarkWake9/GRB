A. Corsi (GWU), S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of the Fermi-LAT GRB 131108A (Racusin et al., GCN
15464) with the Very Large Array in the 18.7-24.9 GHz frequency range,
starting at about 2.6 days after the burst. A provisional reduction shows
a source consistent with the location of the X-ray (Stroh and Kennea,
GCN 15468) and optical (e.g., Xu et al., GCN 15471) afterglow. At this
time, we estimate a preliminary flux of about 200 uJy at 19 GHz.

Further observations are planned.

We thank the VLA staff for their support.
