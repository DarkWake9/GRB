Prymak, H. Steinle (MPE Garching) of the OPTIMA-Burst Team report the
following:
"OPTIMA-Burst at the 1.3m Skinakas Observatory, of the University of 
Crete, Greece observed the Swift UVOT-Errorcircle of GRB 060714 at 
19:53UT (4:42h after the Burst).
We detected a faint source at the UVOT-Position (GCN
Circular #5311). We estimate the brightness of this source in a 10min
white-light image as 19.9+-.5mag. The position overlaps the UVOT 
errorcircle. There is no source at this position in
the USNO-A2 Catalog, and no minor planet according to MPChecker.
