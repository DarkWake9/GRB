Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190512A (trigger #903357)
(Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 24501).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 82.402, -7.582 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  05h 29m 36.5s 
  Dec(J2000) = -07d 34' 56.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 83%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-shaped profile, starting at
T-12 sec, peaking close to T+0 sec, and slowly decaying to background by 
T+50 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 40.1 +- 11.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.70 to T+43.31 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.07 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-2.78 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
