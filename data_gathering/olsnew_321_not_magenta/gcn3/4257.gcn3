the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We began observations in R-Band at UT 20051111 07:04:38, approximately 1
hour after the Swift Trigger (GCN 4248). We detect the OT reported by
ROTSE-III (GCN 4247). Preliminary analysis of the raw data yields R = 18.3
+/- 0.2 mag, based on stacked images with a total exposure time of 50
minutes. Images were calibrated using USNO B1.0 catalog. Analysis is
ongoing.
