SUBJECT: GRB 201031A: Swift detection of a burst

S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC/CRESST), N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:19:55 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201031A (trigger=1003313).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 254.277, -9.140 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 57m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 08' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex 
structure with a duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 09:11 UT on 2021 January 19. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Laha (sib.laha AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
