Paul Price, Tim Axelrod and Brian Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) report:
 
"We have observed the error box of GRB000830 (Hurley et al., GCN #779)
with 3 x 300s exposures with the 50-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo
Observatory starting 31.73 August 2000 UT, i.e. 17.8 hr after the burst.  
Our R_MACHO and B_MACHO images cover all but the eastern-most half
arcminute of the error box, and are slightly deeper than the Digital Sky
Survey (DSS). We find no optical afterglow candidate as compared with the
DSS to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of R_MACHO ~ 20.5 mag."
