S. Barthelmy (GFSC) for the Swift Team:

Swift-BAT triggers 413744 and 413745 are not due to GRBs,
nor anything astrophysical.  They were caused by the Startracker
loosing lock.  Known sources coupled with an incorrect aspect solution
caused these two triggers.  Some GCN/Swift Notices were distributed
before the Startracker loss-of-lock was detected and the Swift-blocked2world
filter was activated.  The Startracker has been re-initialized 
and the spacecraft is back in inertial pointing.  The blocked2world filter
has been removed.
