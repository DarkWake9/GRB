Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121209A (trigger #540964)
(Maselli, et al., GCN Circ. 14045).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 326.800, -8.232 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 47m 12.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 13' 55.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 60%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks starting at ~T-5 sec,
max peak at ~T+28 sec, and ending at ~T+80 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
42.7 +- 2.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.16 to T+44.28 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.43 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.9 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+27.91 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.4 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
