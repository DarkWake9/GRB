report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed  the region of probable optical afterglow of GRB 920925C 
(Denisenko et al., GCN 6155) with Shajn 2.6m telescope of CrAO on Jul. 10. 
Series of images were obtained between (UT) 2007-07-10 21:05:34 and 22:13:36 
in R filter. The limiting magnitude (2 sigma) of the combined image of a 
total exposure of 3540 s (59x60 s) is R=25.4 mag. No object is detected in a 
place of the proposed optical afterglow (Denisenko et al., GCN 6155).   The 
nearest object to the position of proposed afterglow  is an extended object 
S1 at  (J2000) RA = 22 03 31.04 Dec= +25 24 51.2 which is ~ 9.5" South from 
proposed afterglow. The photometry of the S1 is R=23.2 +/-0.1. Photometry 
and astrometry reductions are performed against USNO A2.0 catalog.

The combined image can be found in
