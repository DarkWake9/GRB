report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:

We mistakenly reported the wrong observation time in our previous GCN
27800. We deeply apologize for the confusion caused.

Here is the corrected GCN:-
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We followed up GRB 200524A (F. F. Dirirsa et al., GCN 27797, A. Ho et al.,
GCN 27799) with 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. We obtained 600-sec exposures
in SDSS g, r, i filters starting at UT 2020-05-24T16:11:57 (~11.11 hrs
after the burst). We detect a faint transient with magnitudes r = 20.56 +/-
0.14 and i = 20.59 +/- 0.28 (calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1 data
release, Flewelling
et al., 2018). The source position matches with the likely afterglow
candidate by A. Ho et al. (GCN 27799). The fading rate is approximately 3
magnitudes in ~9.4 hours, consistent with the fading rate reported in the
ZTF GCN. We hereby, confirm ZTF20abbiixp as the afterglow of GRB 200524A.

We obtained the following photometric results:-

------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD(Start) | T-T0(hrs) | Filter | Mag |

------------------------------------------------------------------

2458994.174 | 11.11 | g | > 21.01

2458994.183 | 11.33 | r | 20.56 +/- 0.14

2458994.191 | 11.52 | i | 20.59 +/- 0.28

------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the fast fading of the source, we encourage the followup of the
source. The magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
