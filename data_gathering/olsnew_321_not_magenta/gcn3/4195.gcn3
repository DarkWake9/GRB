The Swift XRT has observed the field of the BAT short burst
GRB051105A (trigger=162580; GCN 4188, Mineo et al.) for 8.6 ks.
There are four sources present in the field close to BAT refined
error box (Barbier et al. GCN 4194):

SR1 at RA= 17h 41m 10.06s, Dec=+34d 55m 48.1s (J2000) (1.4 arcmin from
the BAT position) with a count rate of (1.0+/-0.5)E-3 cts s^-1.

SR2 at  RA= 17h 40m 45.66s, Dec=+34d 58m 06.7s (J2000) (4.8 arcmin
from the BAT position) with a count rate of (1.1+/-0.5)E-3 cts s^-1.

SR3 at RA= 17h 41m 07.60s, Dec=+34d 52m 33.0s (J2000) (4.4 arcmin from
the BAT position) with a count rate of (1.1+/-0.5)E-3 cts s^-1.

SR4 at RA= 17h 41m 05.17s Dec=+34d 52m 35.5s (J2000) (4.4 arcmin from
the BAT position) with a count rate of (1.2+/-0.5)E-3 cts s^-1.

The last two sources are very close to each other, but are resolved by
the XRT.  All these position have a 90% uncertainty of 6.5 arcsec.
None of these sources seems to be fading, and therefore we do not
associate any of them with the afterglow.   On-going observations
will shed more light on the nature of these sources.
