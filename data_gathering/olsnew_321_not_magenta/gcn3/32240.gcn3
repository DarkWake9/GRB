J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII),
A. Y. Lien (U Tampa), T. M. Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) and
M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 15:19:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) located the
source MAXI J0655-013 (trigger=1111242). 
Due to observing constraints, Swift could not slew to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 103.829, -1.479 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 55m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = -01d 28' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, the immediately
available lightcurve does not show clear variation due to this source. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 19:28 UT on 2022 August 19. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

This source, MAXI J0655-013 (GCN #32223; ATEL #15442, #15443),
has been seen by BAT multiple times in 64s or longer image triggers.

The strength of the source is ~100-200 mCrab during the above detections. 

The average location of these detections is RA, Dec 103.806, -1.491
with a standard deviation of ~1.5 arcmin in each coordinate.
