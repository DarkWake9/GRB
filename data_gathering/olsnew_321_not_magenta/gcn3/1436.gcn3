T. Kato (Kyoto U.), M. Yamamoto (Variable Star Observers League in Japan)
report:

   "Following the detection of SGR-like behavior from the anomalous
X-ray pulsar 1E 2259+586 by RXTE (GCN #1432), we obtained the following
optical upper limits from the photographs quasi-simultaneously taken
with the RXTE observation.

   2002 June 18.733 UT fainter than V=11.5
   2002 June 18.735 UT fainter than V=11.8

   The observation was done by Minoru Yamamoto (Aichi Japan),
using a f=200mm F/4 lens and a combination of Tmax400(120) emulsion +
PO0 filter, which approximates the V band."
