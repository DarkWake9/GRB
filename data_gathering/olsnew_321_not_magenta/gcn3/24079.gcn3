report:

We initiated observations of 3 fields (each 2.26 x 2.26 deg^2) within the
LVC localization region for the GW trigger S190408an (GCN Circ 24069)
starting on 2019-04-09 at 11:45 UT. SAGUARO* uses the 1.5m Catalina Sky
Survey telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ and its 5 deg^2 imager to tile the
highest probability regions of the LVC localization that are accessible
from southern Arizona in order to search for electromagnetic counterparts
to gravitational wave events. The typical limiting magnitudes of single
pointings are G~21 mag (calibrated to Gaia DR2). Below are the field
centers observed.

RA DEC
350.4255 56.3125
354.2550 56.3125
349.7730 58.5208

Any interesting transient candidates will be reported as soon as possible.

*SAGUARO stands for Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona's
Observatories. It is a partnership between the University of Arizona and
Northwestern University.
