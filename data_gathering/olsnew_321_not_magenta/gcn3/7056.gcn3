P.A. Milne (U Arizona) reports on behalf of the
Super-LOTIS team:

The 0.60m Super-LOTIS telescope began R-band observations of the error
region of INTEGRAL burst, GRB071109 (Mereghetti et al. GCN 7046), at
02:03:35 UT on 11-09-2007, ~337 minutes after the burst. Observations
consisting of 48x60 second exposures were made through thin clouds.

An afterglow was not detected at the positions of the VLA candidate
source (Chandra et al. GCN 7049), nor the XRT candidate source 
(Perri, Stratta and Burrows GCN 7050), nor the UVOT candidate 
source (Kuin and Perri GCN 7054).

Based upon R2 magnitudes were derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalog, 
the 3-sigma upper limit of the stacked image is R > 19.7.
