Nevada), report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050223 at 03:09:06 UT on 23 Feb 
2005.  The GRB was located within the Earth angle constraint of the Narrow 
Field Instruments and the observatory was not able to slew to it at that 
time.  Swift executed an automated slew to the BAT position at 03:44 UT 
while the observatory was in the SAA.  The XRT began taking data at about 
03:57 UT after exiting the SAA.  The XRT was in Manual state and made 
observations in PCmode.  We find an uncataloged X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 18h 05m 32.6s,
Dec(J2000) = -62d 28' 19.7"

We estimate an uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds.  This position was 
generated using PSU processing software on 400 s of data.  Once data become 
available at the SDC a more accurate refined position will be determined.

This position is within 1.6 arcminutes of the BAT position.
