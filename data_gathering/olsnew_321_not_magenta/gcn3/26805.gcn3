J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 200117A (GCN 26802), at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 116.24 (+0.71 -1.24 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 29.14 (+0.90 -0.78 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive, coherent search for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the neutrino candidate time. From this search, no significant signal was found related to IceCube-200117A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in arXiv:1612.02395, we set the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over 10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):

Timescale   Soft     Normal   Hard
-------------------------------------------
0.128 s:    4.5      7.7      15.
1.024 s:    0.9      1.7      3.4
8.192 s:    0.4      0.5      0.8
