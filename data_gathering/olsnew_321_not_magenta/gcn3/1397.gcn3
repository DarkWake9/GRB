TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1397
SUBJECT: GRB020525, optical observations

A. Henden (USRA/USNO), on behalf of the USNOFS GRB team,
and P. Nelson (Ellinbank Observatory, Victoria),
on behalf of the AAVSO International GRB Network, report:

We have observed the entire IPN error box for
GRB020525 (Hurley et al., GCN 1395) using unfiltered
exposures.  The NOFS 1.0m observations were made at
relatively high airmass, with scattered cirrus and
full moon; the Ellinbank 0.3m observations had clear
conditions but with full moon interference.
   This field is at galactic coordinates
278.1d longitude and 38.6d latitude and has several
faint galaxies.  Comparing with USNO-A and the USNO PMM
scans of the southern R plate, we find no new objects
to the plate limit.  The log of observations:

  UTmid      exp     tel   mlim
020528.178   9x5min  1.0m  22
020528.518  6x20min  0.3m  19

The brightest object not on the photographic plate is
at
      11:29:30.49  -20:18:41.9  J2000

but may be non-stellar.
