G. G. Williams (MMTO), and P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory) on behalf of 
the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box of 
GRB060502 (Swift Trigger 208169, GCNC 5047) at 03:20:46 UT, 1034 seconds 
after the burst (17.23 min; 33 seconds after the delayed GCN notice). 
Our initial observations include 5 x 10s exposures, 5 x 20s exposures, and 
30 x 60s exposures, all in the R-band.

Under thin cirrus we do not detect the Swift afterglow reported by La 
Parola et al. and Cenko et al. (GCN 5047 & 5048) in our earliest 60 second 
exposure to the following 3-sigma limiting magnitude estimated using 
nearby USNO-B1.0 stars:

t_mid obs (UT)	exp t (s)	t-t_0 (s)	Limit
--------------------------------------------------------
03:24:56	60 		1284 		R > 17.9

Additional observations and analysis, including image stacking, are 
ongoing.
