   S.Sinha, P.Sreekumar, K.Kasturirangan, on behalf of SROSS C-2 (INDIAN
GRB EXPERIMENT) team report:
   
    The hardness ratios (during the peak of the bursts) for GRB000801 and
GRB000730 were reported by us to be 0.27+-0.08 and 0.47 +-0.082
respectively. 
     Our hardness ratio is defined as [counts(100-1024 keV)/counts(20-100
keV)].
       For twenty-one SROSS C-2 GRBs that are common with BATSE, we find
the mean hardness ratio to be 0.97 +- 0.079 and the standard deviation of
this distribution is 0.37.
       The hardness ratios for the GRB000801 (GCN 768) and GRB000730 (GCN
772) may be interpreted on the basis of above mentioned data.
       This message is quotable in publications.
