report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We observed the error box of the INTEGRAL GRB081003B (Gotz et
al., GCN8317) with the 30cm BOOTES-1B in El Arenosillo and
with the 1.5m telescope at Observatorio Sierra Nevada.

BOOTES started obtaining unfiltered images at 20:48:49UT (41s
after the GRB trigeer), single images have a detection limit
of ~14 mag. The combination of the first 32 images with an
exposure mean time of 80s after the GRB has a limit of
~17.6mag (calibrated against GSC2). Neither shows any new
sources within the GRB errorbox.

The 1.5m telescope took a single I-band 300s exposure starting
at 21:21:59 (mid exposure ~26.5 min after the GRB), this image
does not reveal any new source in comparison with DSS-IR, but
goes deeper. Further comparison image would be needed to
exploit full potential of this observation.
