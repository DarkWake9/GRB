L. Izzo (DARK/NBI) and D. B. Malesani (DTU Space) report:

We observed the field of GRB 201208A (Fermi-GBM team, GCN #28998, Nadella et al., GCN #29001, Dirirsa et al., GCN #29003) with the Sinistro instrument mounted on the 1-m telescope of the LCO network located at the McDonald Observatory (Texas). Observations started on December 9 at 12:09:55 UT (1.25 days after the GRB trigger). We obtained a series of 5x120s images in r filter.

Within the XRT best candidate afterglow position at RA (J2000) = 10:33:17.64, Dec. (J2000) = -28:43:11.6, and with an error of 3.1" (see Evans, GCN #29002) we do not detect any optical afterglow candidate.  In our stacked image we measure an upper limit value of r > 23 (AB mag), calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS catalog stars.
