TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  15857
SUBJECT: GRB 140215A: WSRT radio observation
DATE:    14/02/18 09:22:49 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 140215A afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at February 17 14.69 UT to
February 18 02.66 UT, i.e. 2.44 - 2.94 days after the burst (GCN 15837).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical
counterpart (GCN 15852). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around
that position is 126 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for
a point source at the position of the optical counterpart is 51 +/- 42
microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining
these observations."
