The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:56:02 UT on 14 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200714A (trigger 616398967.25892 / 200714247).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 10.4, Dec = 57.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 41m, 57d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70.0 degrees.
