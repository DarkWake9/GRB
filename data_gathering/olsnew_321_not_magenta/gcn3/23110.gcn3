Toy (UMD) report:

We observed the field of GRB 180809B (Moss et al., GCN Circ. 23105) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/08 10.19 to 2018/08 10.29
UTC (8.2 to 10.6 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 1.42
hours exposure in the r and i bands.

We do not detect the UVOT and MASTER optical counterpart (Moss et al.,
GCN Circ. 23105; Lipunov et al., GCN Circ. 23109) to the following
3-sigma limits:

r > 23.6
i > 23.5

These magnitudes are in comparison with the USNO-B1, are in the AB
system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of
the GRB.

The optical counterpart has faded by more than 6 magnitudes between the
MASTER and RATIR observations.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
