SUBJECT: GRB 151027A: KAIT optical afterglow confirmation

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report
on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 151027A (Maselli et al.,
GCN 18478) immediately after receiving the trigger. Observations were
performed with an automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V,
and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image.
Inside the XRT error circle we detected an un-cataloged varying
source with coordinates of :

RA =  18:09:56.70 (J2000)
DEC= +61:21:13.01 (J2000)

The object location is consistent with the position reported
from UVOT (Maselli et al., GCN 18478). The object has clear band mag
of ~13.0 at the moment.

Follow-up observations are encouraged.
