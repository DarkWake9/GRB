E. Mazaeva (IKI), S. Nazarov (CrAO), A. Kusakin (Fesenkov Astrophysical 
Institute),  A. Volnova (IKI), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 170524A (trigger=754322) (Gropp 
et al., GCN 21135)  with Zeiss-1000 (East) of Tien Shan Astronomical 
Observatory and AZT-8 telescope of CrAO. We obtained several images in R 
filter. The TSHAO observations started on 2017-05-24 (UT) 20:31:45 under 
not optimal weather conditions.  Observations in CrAO started on 
2017-05-25 (UT) 00:18:50. Within enhanced XRT position (Evans et al. GCN 
21136)  we did not detect any  optical source in the first epoch. In the 
second epoch (CrAO observation) we detected an object which is on the 
edge of the  enhanced XRT position. The object has coordinates (J2000) 
21:17:56.30 +48:36:27.9 with uncertainties of about 1 arcsec in each 
coordinate and brightness of R=20.10 +/- 0.15 at 0.1992 days after the 
Swift trigger. For now we can not say anything about the object 
variability. However the object is barely visible in DSS2 (Red).
The preliminary results of field photometry are as follows

Photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars
