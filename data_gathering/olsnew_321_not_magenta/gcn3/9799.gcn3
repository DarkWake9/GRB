Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090814A (trigger #359951)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 9793).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 239.613, 25.586 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 58m 27.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 35' 09.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a few semi-overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-18 sec, peaking at ~T-13 sec, peaking at ~T+8 sec, and ending
at ~T+115 sec.  There is possible 10-sec precursor peak (3 sigma) at ~T-145 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 80 +- 8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-16.4 to T+73.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.81 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-12.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
