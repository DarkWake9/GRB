report on behalf of the GRACE collaboration:

"We have obtained two spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 040924 
(GCN #2735, 2734) with the FORS2 long slit spectrograph on the 
ESO VLT (Antu) on 10 October 2004, approx. 15.75 days after burst.  
The first spectrum was taken at 05:10 UT using the 300V grism, with 
an exposure time of 1800 s; the second spectrum was taken at 05:48 UT 
using the 300I grism, again with an exposure time of 1800 s. We used 
a 1 arcsec slit. The total wavelength range is approx. 400 - 950 nm. 

We find weak emission lines in the spectra, which we identify with
[OII] 3727, [NeIII] 3968.9, H gamma, H beta and [OIII] 4959,5007.
All of these lines are consistent with a redshift z = 0.859.

The presence of [NeIII] implies a galaxy with a significant 
population of massive stars. The isotropic energy of the burst is 
E_iso=1.48x10^52 erg, using the 25-100 keV fluence value from HETE 
and a cosmology with H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_matter=0.3 and 
Omega_lambda=0.7. As the lightcurve breaks fairly early on, the true 
energy is likely to be much lower.
The presence of continuum features relating to a supernova
can only be determined after further analysis: a SN1998bw-like bump 
would be expected to peak at approximately t_V~23.5 days, t_R~25 days and 
t_I~26 days with magnitudes V~25.4, R~24.6 and I~23.8.

We acknowledge excellent support from the staff of Paranal Observatory 
and ESO's PSO and USG."
