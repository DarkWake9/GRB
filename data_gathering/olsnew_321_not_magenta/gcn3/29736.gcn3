report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B triggered a long burst,
GRB 210330A, at 2021-03-30T12:45:46.600 UTC (denoted as T0).

GECAM alert data was promptly downlinked to the ground through the
short message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).
The time latency of the first BeiDou message relative to the trigger time
is about 1 minute.

According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of
a broad pulses with duration of about 20 s.

An automatic on-ground localization was calculated using the light curves
and counts spectrum in the BDS alert data.
Although the in-flight calibration of energy response and localization
has not been finalized yet, GECAM-B localized this burst to
the following position (J2000):
Ra: 164.3 deg Dec: -55.6 deg
Err: 5.1 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

Given that the location is close to the galactic plane, we cannot rule out
the possibility that this burst originated from a galactic source.

The GECAM preliminary location could be found here:

As the detailed science data are downloaded, all analyses would be improved.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
