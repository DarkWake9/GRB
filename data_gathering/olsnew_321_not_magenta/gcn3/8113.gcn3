Swift Team:

At 13:12:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a second outburst from a new SGR source 0501+4516 (trigger=321177)
which was previously reported as GRB 080822 (Holland et al, GCN Circ 8112). 
Swift was already looking at this location from the trigger on this source
of ~30 min earlier.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 75.265, +45.272, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 01m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 16' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
with a duration of less than 128 msec.  The peak count rate
was ~17000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.
