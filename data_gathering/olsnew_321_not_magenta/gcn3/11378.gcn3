report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:39:33.60 UT on 24 October 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 101024A (trigger 309613175/101024486)
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT
(De Pasquale et al. 2010, GCN 11370).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 142 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of three pulses with the first
pulse starting about 5 seconds before the trigger.
The event has a duration (T90) of about 24 (+/-2) s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.003 s to T0+19.456 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is 1.4 (+1.6/-0.8)  and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 56.25 (+5.96/-5.54) keV
(CSTAT 447 for 359 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.2 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.5 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 8.2 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
