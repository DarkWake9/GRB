WeiKang Zheng (UC Berkeley), Xianggao Wang (UC Berkeley, GXU, UNLV)
and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150811A (Evans et al.,
GCN 18119) about 10 minutes after the burst. Observations were
performed with an automatic sequence in the clear (roughly R), V,
and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image. 
Inside the XRT error circle we detected an un-cataloged source with
coordinates of :

RA =  19:25:21.40 (J2000)
DEC= -15:25:30.96 (J2000)

The object has I band mag of ~16.5 at ~15 minutes after
burst and is decaying. We suggest this is the afterglow of GRB 150811A.
Follow-up observations are encouraged.
