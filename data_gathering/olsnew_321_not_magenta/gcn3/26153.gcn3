A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (SSDC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 06:34:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR 1935+2154 (trigger=933083).  Swift did not slew to the source. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 293.743, +21.896, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 34m 58s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 53' 44"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
structure with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Swift did not slew to this source because the merit value of the 
source being observed by Swift was higher than the merit value 
for this known source.
