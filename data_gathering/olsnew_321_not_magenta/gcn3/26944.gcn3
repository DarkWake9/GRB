The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:59:56 UT on 30 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200130B (trigger 602071201.67246 / 200130417).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 137.5, Dec = -51.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 09m, -51d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 34.0 degrees.
