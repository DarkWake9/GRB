L. Vetere (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:26:13 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on 
what is probably a cosmic ray particle event.  However until we 
receive the full BAT event data set (in over three hours) we cannot
definitively rule out this being a short GRB.  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA,Dec 279.037,-42.733  {18h 36m 09s, -42d 43' 57"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This is a weak event and the currently available 
BAT light curve does not show much structure. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT and UVOT data products
to analyze. The field will become visible to the Narrow Field Instruments
at 18:28 UT.
