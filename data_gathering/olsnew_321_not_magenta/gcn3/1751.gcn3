TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1751
SUBJECT: GRB 021211, IR observations

We observed the position of the afterglow of GRB 021211
(Fox et al. GCN 1731) with the Magellan Baade telescope
and ClassiCam IR imager beginning Dec. 12.18 (UT). A point
source is well detected at the positon of the afterglow
and we estimate a brightness of J=21.76+\-0.11 based
on a number of Persson IR standards obtained during the
night. A second set of J-band images centered at Dec. 12.33 (UT)
provides a magnitude of J=21.73+\-0.12 and combined
with the observations of McLeod et al. (GCN 1750) gives
a color of R-J=1.5, implying an absence of a strong
Lyman break between the R and J bands. Thus, the
Lyman break is likely shortward of 600nm, placing a
limit on the redshift of about z<4 for GRB 021211.
