D. Bersier wishes to apologise for any confusion related to the wrong title of 
GCN  13307. The GCN Circular reports observations of GRB120521B, not GRB120521A. 
The title should read: "GRB120521B: Faulkes Telescope South observations".

I thank C. Guidorzi for drawing my attention to this mistake.
