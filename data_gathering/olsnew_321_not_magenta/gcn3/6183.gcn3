P. Roming (PSU) reporting on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT team is currently uploading enhancements to the UVOT 
software. Due to the fact that the code load has not been completed, the 
UVOT generated finding charts in all the UVOT color filters for GRB 
070309 (GCN 6182). Although this is not normal operating procedure for 
the UVOT, we want to make the community aware that the finding charts 
are valid data for the field of the GRB. We apologize for any confusion 
the code load has created.
