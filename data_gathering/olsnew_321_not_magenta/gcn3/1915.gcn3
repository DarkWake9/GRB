report:

"We have obtained a second epoch observation 
covering the INTEGRAL error box for GRB 030227 
(Gotz et al. GCN Circ. 1895, 1896) with the 2.5 m 
Isaac Newton Telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de 
los Muchachos (Canary Islands, Spain). Three R-band 
frames (600 s exposure time each) have been obtained 
on Feb 28.95 UT.  Within the X-ray source error box 
given by XMM-Newton (Loiseau et al. GCN Circ. 1901),
the object suggested by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN Circ. 1904)
as a possible afterglow candidate with R = 23.3 
(this value supersedes the one given in GCN Circ. 1904)
is not detected down to R = 24.2. This confirms its
relationship to GRB 030227, also proposed by Soderberg
et al. (GCN Circ. 1906) and Berger et al. (GCN Circ. 1910)."
