Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130419A (trigger #553918)
(Kuin, et al., GCN Circ. 14391). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 355.278, 9.900 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  23h 41m 06.7s
    Dec(J2000) = +09d 54' 00.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 82%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single long period of emission starting
about T+30 sec, peaking at T+60 sec and declining until T+140 sec.  There is
weak secondary peak at T+120 sec superimposed on the main declining emission.
A slew took the source out of the BAT field of view around T+280 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 75.7 +- 49.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+40.09 to T+169.51 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.43 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.8 +- 1.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+55.43 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
