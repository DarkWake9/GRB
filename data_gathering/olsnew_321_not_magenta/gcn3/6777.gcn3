H. A. Krimm (GSFC/USRA), C. B. Markwardt (CRESST/GSFC/UMD),
K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:57:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070911 (trigger=290624).  Swift automatic slews are
currently disabled, as we are currently recovering from a safehold. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 25.799, -33.473 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 43m 12s
   Dec(J2000) = -33d 28' 21"
with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty, however there is an uncalibrated boresight
shift due to operations with a different set of gyros than we have
used previously).  The BAT light curve showed a complex multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 150 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~8000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~36 sec after the trigger. 

Because we are in the process of resuming normal operations,
there is no automatic follow-up observation by
the XRT and UVOT. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
