SUBJECT: ANNOUNCEMENT ON INTEGRAL GRB ALERTS

FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

Dear IBAS User

On January 17, 2003 the INTEGRAL Science Data Center (ISDC) will begin to
distribute via internet the Alert Packets generated in real time by the
INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS).

A conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius)
will be added to the statistical error on the burst position reported by
the IBAS Alert Packets.  Refined positions of the bursts will be
distributed as soon as available. It is expected that the systematic
uncertainties will decrease significantly in the course of the coming
months.

More details can be found on the ISDC web pages

[GCN OPS NOTE: A quick scan of the "sites.cfg" file for the GCN Notices
shows that there are many sites who have not yet requested that INTEGRAL
Notice(s) be enabled.  People are busy, so that is some of the explanation.
Since the automated phase of IBAS is about to begin, I am sure that some
of those sites will want to take the opportunity to request that
INTEGRAL Notice type(s) be enabled for their site through GCN.]
