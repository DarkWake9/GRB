The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 18:17:42 UT on 5 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200605A (trigger 613073867.194696 / 200605762).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 93.0, Dec = 53.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 12m, 53d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 46.0 degrees.
