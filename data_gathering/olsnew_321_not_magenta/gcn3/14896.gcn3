G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 03:22:23.36 UT on 12 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130612A (trigger 392700146/130612141)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Racusin et al., GCN Circ. 14874).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 5.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.6 s to T0+2.3 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.3 +/- 0.3 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 61.9 +/- 10.5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.7 +/- 0.6)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.1 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
