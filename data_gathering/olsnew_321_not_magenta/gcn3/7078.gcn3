observing program at Crni Vrh Observatory:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 071112C (Perri et al., GCN 7059) with 60-cm
Cichocki robotic telescope at Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia in rather poor
seeing conditions. The series of nineteen 90 second connsecutive exposures
with Rc filter started at 18:35:51UT, 118 seconds after the GCN notice time.
We confirm optical afterglow found by UVOT. The object measured coordinates
are RA=02:36:50.95, DEC=+28:22:16.8 (J2000). The object was clearly detected
on first nine frames after which it dropped below the detection limit.

Photometry results are given in table below. The magnitudes are derived
using comparison stars from the USNO-B1 catalogue. The 3-sigma limiting
magnitude in R filter is around magnitude 18.2.

Time refers to exposure start.
