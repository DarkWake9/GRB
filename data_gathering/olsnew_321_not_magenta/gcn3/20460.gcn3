Xing Wen (IHEP), Yi Zhao (IHEP) and Hancheng Li (IHEP)
report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-01-12T23:16:09.00 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground 
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 170112B, 
which was also detected by the 
Fermi/GBM (trigger 505955774/170112970).

The POLAR light curve consists of a single peak,
with a duration (T90) of 13.54 s measured from T0-0.06 s.
The 1-s peak rate measured from T0+0.00 s is 509.0 cnts/s.
The total counts is about 1970 cnts. The above measurements
are in the energy range of about 80-500 keV.
