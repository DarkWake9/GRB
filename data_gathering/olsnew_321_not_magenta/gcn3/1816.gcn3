At 03:22:34.28 UTC (12154.28 s UT) on 15 Jan 2003, the HETE FREGATE, 
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2533, a long GRB. A GCN 
Alert was issued at 03:22:41 UT, 7 sec after the beginning of the 
burst.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a localization which was 
reported in a GCN Notice at 04:33:07 UT, 71 minutes after the burst. 
The WXM localization SNR was 22. The WXM location can be expressed as 
a 90% confidence circle that is 10 arcminutes in radius and is 
centered at

WXM:   RA = +11h 18m 41s, Dec = +15d 06' 54" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a further 
refinement in the location, which was reported in a GCN Notice at 
04:46:34 UT, 84 minutes after the burst. The SXC localization SNR was 
17. The SXC location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that 
is 2 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

SXC:   RA = +11h 18m 30s, Dec = +15d 02' 17" (J2000).

The SXC localization may be improved.

The burst duration in the 4-40 keV band was ~20 s. A total of 5030 
counts were detected during that interval, corresponding to a fluence 
of ~9 x 10-7 ergs cm-2. The peak flux was >1 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 
(ie >4 x Crab flux) in 150ms.
