The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:51:18 UT on 31 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200531A (trigger 612586283.524172 / 200531119).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 164.6, Dec = 31.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 58m, 31d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 124.0 degrees.
