SUBJECT: GRB 190427A: Swift detection of a short burst

A. Tohuvavohu (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
D. M. Palmer (LANL) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 04:34:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190427A (trigger=900730).  Swift's slew will be delayed
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 280.213, +40.322 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 40m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = +40d 19' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single short
structure with a duration of about 0.5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+43.4
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Tohuvavohu (aaronb AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
