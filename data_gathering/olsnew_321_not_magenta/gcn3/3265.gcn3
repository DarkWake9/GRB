S. Bradley Cenko and Derek B Fox report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-
Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of the Swift GRB050416 with the
automated Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  We find the presence of a bright,
stationary source not present in the DSS at the location:

RA: 12:33:54.6
Dec: +21:03:26.7
J2000.0

We tentatively identify this object as the afterglow of GRB050416
