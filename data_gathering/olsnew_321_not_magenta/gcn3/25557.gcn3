The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the position of ASKAP J005547-270433 (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/25487.gcn3), a candidate radio counterpart to the LIGO/Virgo event S190814bv (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/25324.gcn3) in the time range of 0.1 days before to 14 days after the gravitational wave trigger time (2019-08-14 18:46:39.010 UTC to 2019-08-28 21:10:39.010 UTC). 

Two track-like events are found in spatial coincidence with ASKAP J005547-270433 during this time period. These events are consistent (p-value = 1.0) with an atmospheric background-only hypothesis. Accordingly, we derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 4.35 x 10^-4 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. 

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.
