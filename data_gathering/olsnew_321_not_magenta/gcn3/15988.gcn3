N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), T. Kruehler (ESO Chile),
S. Schulze (PUC and MCSS), R. Karjalainen (ING) report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 140318A (Cenko et al. GCN 15986;
Schulze et al. GCN 15987) with the WHT using the ACAM spectrograph,
beginning March 18 02:06 UT, approximately 2 hours post-trigger.
The wavelength range covered was from about 5000 AA to 9500 AA.

In our provisional reduction, the continuum trace of the
aftergow+host is well detected, and a single emission line is seen
at ~7520 AA.  It is most likely that this is OII 3727, given the
absence of any other lines.  We therefore infer a redshift of
z=1.02, and tentatively identify this as the redshift of the burst.

Further analysis is ongoing.
