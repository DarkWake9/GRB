C. Pagani and  P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift-XRT has observed the error box of the IPN GRB 141202A (Golenetskii et al., GCN Circ. 17131) in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 12.3 ks spread over 7 fields; the maximum exposure within the sky observed was 2.7 ks. The observations started 93.5 ks after the IPN trigger and extended over ~50.8 ks.

Within these data no credible X-ray afterglow is detected. The 3-sigma upper limit is 5.2E-03 cts s^-1 (0.3-10 keV). The automated analysis of the XRT data detects three X-ray sources that are classified as possible afterglow candidates, but inspection of the data shows these to be artifacts due to contamination by the bright Earth.

The automated analysis is reported online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00033

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
