T. N. Ukwatta (MSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 01:32:02 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140118A (trigger=584136).  Swift did not slew to the burst
because the location is sun-constrained. The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 331.003, -17.948 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 04m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 56' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a broad triangle-
shaped peak structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count 
rate was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 07:34 UT on 2014 April 03. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (hans.krimm AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
