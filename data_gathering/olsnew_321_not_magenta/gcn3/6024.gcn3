Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), Suzaku (WAM), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
and RHESSI observed this intense, ~60 s long event at 26445 s.
Using Odyssey, Suzaku, and INTEGRAL data, it was triangulated
to two annuli, whose preliminary coordinates are RA, Dec, Radius=
96.685, 23.883, 20.068 +/- 0.041, and 82.803, 82.086, 50.831 +/- 4.47
degrees.

Swift was slewing at the time of the burst. A marginal source (of
insufficient significance to trigger a regular GRB response) was
detected in a routine image made after the slew was completed. The
source coincides with the intersection of the Odyssey-INTEGRAL and
WAM-INTEGRAL annuli. Ground processing of the image improves the
significance of the detection. The BAT ground-derived position is 

RA, Dec 117.850, +31.140 degrees

with a 2.5 arcmin radius error circle (estimated 90% confidence limit).
The detection implies that the burst was continuing in the BAT energy
range for > 4 minutes after T0.

A Swift ToO observation has been requested.  Details of the energy
spectrum will be reported later.
