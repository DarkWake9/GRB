C.A. Wilson-Hodge (NASA/MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:48:54 UT on 24 August 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and located
GRB 080824 (trigger 241307335 / 080824909). The on-ground calculated
location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 120.3, Dec = -3.2
(J2000 degrees)(equivalent to J2000 08h 01m, -3d 10'), with a statistical
uncertainty of less than 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment; there is
additionally a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3
degrees). The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17 degrees.

This GRB was single peaked with a tail. Estimated values (50-300 keV) for
T50 and T90 are 6.1 and 28 s, respectively. The time-averaged spectrum from
T-5.9s to T+6.4 s is best fit with a Band function spectrum with
alpha = -0.4 +/- 0.2, Epeak = 100 +/- 16 keV, and beta = -2.1 +/- 0.2. The
fluence (50-300 keV) is 2.3E-6 erg/cm^2."

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; the final
results will be published in the Fermi GBM GRB Catalog.
