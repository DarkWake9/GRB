NUMBER:  4691
SUBJECT: GRB060206: P60 Optical Observations

E. O. Ofek, S. B. Cenko, A. M. Soderberg (Caltech), and D. B. Fox (Penn
State) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of GRB060206A (Morris et al. GCN 4682),
with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope, starting 1.4 hours after the
GRB trigger.  Observations were taken under poor external conditions
(cirrus clouds and below-average seeing).

We find the afterglow reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN 4683) at J2000.0
coordinates:

	RA: 13:31:43.47
	Dec: +35:03:03.3

The R-band magnitude of the afterglow, ~3.44 hours after the GRB trigger
was about 17.2, assuming R=16.17 for the nearby USNO-B1 star 1250-0209088
(13:31:43.65 +35:02:31.4).
