George Younes (GWU), Chryssa Kouveliotou (GWU), Rachel Hamburg (UAH),
and Eric Burns (UAH) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"At 13:54:30.75 UT on 26 June 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered on a bright, SGR-like burst from the direction of
the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (trigger 488642074/160626580). This
burst also triggered Swift/BAT (GCN #19590, Barthelmy et al. 2016).

The burst has a duration of T90 ~ 700 +/- 20 ms in the energy range
10-200 keV. It is well-fit by a two blackbody model with temperatures
of kT1 = 8.0 +/- 0.1 keV and kT2 = 14.0 +/- 0.3 keV.  The
corresponding flux  in the energy range 10-200 keV is (2.49 +/-
0.01)E-05 erg/s/cm^2. The peak flux integrated over 16 ms is (3.6 +/-
0.1)E-05 erg/s/cm^2.

We note that the source has been undergoing an outburst since 2016 May
14, with a total of 39 GBM triggers. This is the third activation of the
source following its July 2014 and February 2015 outbursts. The
analysis results presented above are preliminary, and the full
analysis of the bursts from all three outbursts is underway."
