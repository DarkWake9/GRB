report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 16:07:46 UT on 2020-12-14, simultaneously with the Fermi GBM 
detection of GRB 201214B (GCN 29039), BAT triggered (Trigger=1012872) 
on a rate increase at the 0.064 s timescale and produced an image. 
This image shows a 6 sigma peak, which was not significant enough 
to trigger an automated ground notification and repoint. 
The on-board calculated location 
ra, dec = 188.032, +9.045 was refined by ground analysis 
to 187.9710, +9.1031 which is
 RA(J2000) = 12h 31m 53s
 Dec(J2000) = 09d 06' 11‚Äù
with an uncertainty of 2 arcminutes (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The currently-available BAT light curve shows
a ~0.1 second long peak, with a possible smaller peak 0.3 seconds earlier. 
The peak value on a 64 ms timescale is ~3000 counts/s (15-350 keV)
at the trigger time. 

Swift has begun XRT and UVOT observations of this source starting at T0+~28ks
using the on-board BAT location (GCN 29043). 
Automated analysis of the XRT data will be presented online at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021407

The BAT location is consistent with both the Fermi-GBM position and 
the IPN annulus (Svinkin, priv. comm.).  The temporal and positional 
coincidence with the Fermi GBM burst convinces us that the BAT
location is correct. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. K. Simpson (kira.simpson1984 AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
