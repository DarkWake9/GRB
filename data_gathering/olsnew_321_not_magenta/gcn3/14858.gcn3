report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 03:12:10.50 UT on 10 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130610A (trigger 392526733 /130610133)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cummings et al., GCN Circ. 14842).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.6 s to T0+25.7 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.0 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 294.9 +/- 42.9 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.1 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+8.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.5 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
