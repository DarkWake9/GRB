At 18:31:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 
located trigger 371210, which is the known source IGR J17511-3057.  
Swift slewed immediately to the location.  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is  RA, Dec 267.767, -30.979 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 51m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 58' 42"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve is consistent with
a type 1 thermonuclear X-ray burst, both in duration and because it
appears only in the lowest energy band (15-25 keV). 

The XRT began observing the field at 18:33:07.8 UT, 71.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright
X-ray counterpart located at RA, Dec 267.78641, -30.96082 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 51m 8.74s
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 57' 39.0"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 88 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle, and is consistent with the position obtained with Chandra 
(ATel #2215).
