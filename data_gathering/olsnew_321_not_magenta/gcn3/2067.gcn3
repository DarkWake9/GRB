report:

We continue to monitor the OT of GRB030329 (GCN  2005, 2028, 2050).

The OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985)  was imaged Cassegrain 38-cm
telescope of CrAO.  Several 240 sec. exposures in  R (Johnson) spectral band
were obtained. Based on filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN 2023)  we
estimate the OT magnitude as

Mid Time (UT)              exposure             OT (R)
Apr 1.8754                   4x240 sec       17.07+/-0.05

Also we refined our estimations of OT within March 29-31.
