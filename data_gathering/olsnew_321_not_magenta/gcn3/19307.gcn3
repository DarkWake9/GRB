S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), V. D'Elia (ASDC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC),
H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:39:22 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on noise
while entering the SAA  (trigger=682614).  Swift did not slew because of Sun
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 58.958, -8.346, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 55m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 20' 44"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a rapidly increasing background
due to entering the SAA.  This trigger is not astrophysical. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 04:53 UT on 2016 June 25. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time.
