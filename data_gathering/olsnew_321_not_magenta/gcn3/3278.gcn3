S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano) and N.Mowlavi (ISDC, Versoix)  on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

Based on positional coincidence, soft spectral shape, and duration of the 
event, we conclude that the IBAS Alert n. 2463 which occurred on 
2005-04-16 at 22:11:40 UT is most likely due to an outburst from the X-ray 
source AX J1754.2-2754 (Sakano et al. 2002, ApJS 138, 19) and not to a GRB
