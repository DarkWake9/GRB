Adria C. Updike (Roger Williams University) and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report on behalf of the AZTEC collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 141015A (Troja et al., GCN 16909) with the 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona under good conditions.  Super-LOTIS began taking images 81 seconds after the trigger and continued for 37 minutes, obtaining 10 sec, 20 sec, and 60 sec images in the R band.  We do not detect any source within the XRT error circle (Troja et al., GCN 16910):
