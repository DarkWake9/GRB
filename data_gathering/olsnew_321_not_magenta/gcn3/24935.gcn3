DATE:    19/07/01 10:25:41 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 190701A, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 28.0815, 58.9095 which
is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 01 52 19.56
   Dec (J2000) = +58 54 34.3
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% confidence).
Analysis of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/912310.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
