We observed the field of GRB 220117A detected by Swift (Melandri et al., 
GCN 31466) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. Observations automatically started at 16:21:57 UT on 2022-01-17 
(i.e., 186 s after the BAT trigger), and a series of 40 s, 60 s, 90 s, 
200 s frames were obtained in the Sloan r- and z- filters.

No uncatalogued optical transient is detected in our stacked images at 
the Swift-XRT position (GCN 31466), down to limiting magnitudes of 
r~19.6 and z~18.7, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.

Nevertheless, we note that from PanSTARRS there exists a source at the 
border of the Swift-XRT error circle at coordinates R.A. (J2000) = 
6:06:17.32 and Dec. (J2000) = -28:26:13.07, which has magnitudes of g 
~21.51, r~21.05, i~20.99, and z~21.02, rasing the possibility as the 
host galaxy of the GRB. This sky area is not covered by SDSS and Legacy 
Survey. SkyMapper covered the sky area with upper limits of r~19.0 and 
z~19.0, comparable to the NEXT's level. It is thus unclear if the 
PanSTARRS source is related to the GRB or not.
