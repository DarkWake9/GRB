(INAF-IASFPA) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 170115B in a series of observations tiled
on the sky. The total exposure time is 4.7 ks, distributed over 5
tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location was 3.3 ks. The
data were collected between T0+54.5 ks and T0+66.3 ks, and are entirely
in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

One uncatalogued X-ray source has been detected, it is below the RASS
limit and shows no definitive signs of fading. Therefore, at the
present time we cannot confirm this as the afterglow. Details of this
source are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  189.0597  =  12:36:14.34
  Dec (J2000.0): -46.8311  =  -46:49:52.1
  Error: 6.5 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: 0.0117 +/- 0.0029 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 163 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the tiled XRT
observations, including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are
available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00062.
