TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  552
SUBJECT: GRB000214: X-ray afterglow candidate 
DATE:    00/02/14 14:52:19 GMT
FROM:    Luigi Piro at IAS/CNR Frascati  <piro@ias.rm.cnr.it>

A BeppoSAX follow up of GRB000214 with the Narrow Field Instruments
started around Feb.14 at 13:11 UT, i.e. 12 hours after the GRB.

Preliminary analysis of the MECS (1.6-10 keV) data of the 1st orbit shows
a relatively strong, previously unknown source inside the WFC error box
at:

R.A.(2000)= 283.61
DEC(2000)= -66.477

with  an error radius of 1.5'.
