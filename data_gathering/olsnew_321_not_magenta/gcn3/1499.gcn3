on the behalf of the GROAR Team, report:

We have imaged the error box of the GRB020812
(G. Ricker et al. GCN 1468) from Campo Imperatore
Observatory with the 1.1 meters AZT-24 telescope
and the SWIRCAM Near Infra-Red camera. Observations
started on 12-08-2002 20:19:44 UT and ended on 
12-08-2002 01:27:10 UT.

About 40% of the error box has been imaged at IR
wavelengths both in J and K bands. No new source has
been detected and the counterpart reported by A.Pozanenko
(GCN 1481) is not detected down to a limiting magnitude
of J 18 and K 17.

The images can be found at http://grb.mporzio.astro.it.
