Antonino D'AÃ¬ (INAF-IASFPA) & Aaron Tohuvavohu (Uni. Toronto) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed further follow-up observations of the
Fermi/GBM (von Kienlin GCN 30340) and Swift/BAT-GUANO detected burst 
GRB 210626A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circ. 30325), collecting 7.9 ks 
of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+29.7 ks and T0+143 ks.

The X-ray source detected in the first 1.4 ks of data as possible 
GRB afterglow candidate  (Perri et al. GCN 30329)  has faded more 
than 3 sigma in the  latest observation, and it is thus confirmed as the 
X-ray afterglow of the burst.

The results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available
at https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/00021453/.
