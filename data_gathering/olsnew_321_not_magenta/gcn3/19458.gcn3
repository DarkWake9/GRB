report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 01:33:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160525A (trigger=687492).  Swift could not slew to the 
burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 103.530, -0.173 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 06h 54m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 10' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger, there
is no obvious variation in the immediately available lightcurve. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 12:15 UT on 2016 August 19. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Although the observing constraint prevents a confirmation of
this untriggered event, its significance (7.2 sigma) makes
it most likely to be a real astrophysical event.  A more
definite determination will require the full downlinked dataset. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Stamatikos (Michael.Stamatikos-1 AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
