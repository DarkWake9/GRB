Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:


"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward GRB
080120 (GCN 7194) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 January 8th at 
21.72 UT.
The GRB is undetected and the 2-sigma upper limit on the peak radio flux 
at the
SWIFT-XRT position (GCN 7199) is 100 uJy (rms 50 uJy).
