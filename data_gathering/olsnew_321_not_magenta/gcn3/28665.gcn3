The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:46:32 UT on 17 Oct 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201017A (trigger 624620797.629664 / 201017407).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 21.7, Dec = 63.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 26m, 63d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 100.0 degrees.
