Using the data set from T-239 to T+767 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210420B (trigger #1044382)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 29844).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 254.313, 42.558 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 57m 15.1s
   Dec(J2000) = +42d 33' 28.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 77%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~160 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 158.8 +- 29.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-21.30 to T+160.09 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.49 +- 0.19.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+21.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
