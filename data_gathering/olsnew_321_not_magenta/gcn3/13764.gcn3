Skynet observed the field of GRB120913B (GCN 13763, Swift trigger #533613) 
with four of the PROMPT telescopes located at CTIO in Chile in BVRI 
beginning ~58 seconds after the burst. We detect a fading source at RA 
14:14:38.46 DEC -14:30:57.2, within the BAT error circle.

The object peaked at a magnitude of ~15.9 in R (calibrated to nearby SDSS 
catalog stars) at ~4.2 minutes after the burst before beginning to fade.

Further observations are ongoing.
