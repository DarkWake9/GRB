Bret L. Little, Ben Boizelle, Kimberly Bates, Michael Abbott, and J.
Ward Moody report for
Brigham Young University’s ROVOR team:

We report our observations in the field of GRB 110210A (Swift trigger
445141, D'Elia et al., GCN 11687) on Feb 11 beginning 16.25 hours post-burst
at 02:09:18 UT. The 0.41m ROVOR telescope in Delta, Utah,
automatically imaged this location upon power up.

We combined sixteen 120 second exposures, four each in BVRI. No
detection of an afterglow
inside the XRT error circle (Goad, et al., GCN. Circ. 11689) was obtained
after stacking the images. An upper limit of 20.0 ± 0.5 mag in R2
was found by comparing against USNOB values.
