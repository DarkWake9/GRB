F. Yuan (U Mich), E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), W. Rujopakarn (Steward), H. Swan 
(U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 071112C (Swift trigger 296504; Perri, M. et. al., GCN 
7059). The first image was at 18:34:01.8 UT, 64.3 s after the burst 
(10.8 s after the GCN notice time). We detect the OT reported in GCN 
7059. The magnitude of the OT was roughly constant for the first few 
hundred seconds and then faded rapidly afterward. Further analysis is 
ongoing. The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO B1.0.
