and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 151210B (Fermi-GBM trigger #471401960) triggered the CALET 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:59:20.12 UT on 10 December 2015.  The burst 
was detected by all three CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the Soft Gamma-ray Monitor (SGM; 30 keV - 20 MeV) shows the main 
peak starting from T0-3 sec, peaking at T0 and ending at T0+~40 sec.   
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 39 +- 3  sec (40-460 keV).  

Currently, CALET is in the commissioning phase.  Further information about CALET and 
CGBM can be found at http://calet.jp/en/ and http://www.en.yoshida-agu.net/research/calet-gbm
