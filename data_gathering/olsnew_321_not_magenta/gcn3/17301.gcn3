K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has observed the error circle of the MAXI GRB 150110C in a
series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is
3.8 ks spread over 4 fields; the maximum exposure within the sky observed
was 2.4 ks. The observations started 54.2 ks after the MAXI trigger.
Within these data we detect an uncatalogued X-ray source at RA, Dec =
68.48007, -16.96802 which is equivalent to:
  RA (J2000.0)	= 04h 33m 55.22s
  Dec (J2000.0) = -16d 58' 04.9"
with an uncertainty of 7.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The source has
a mean X-ray (0.3-10 keV) count rate of 4.0 (+/- 2.2) x 10^-3 count s^-1.
The exposure at this location was 1.5 ks. At the present time we cannot be
sure whether or not this source is the afterglow.

The results of the automatic processing for this source are available
at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00037/index_1.php
