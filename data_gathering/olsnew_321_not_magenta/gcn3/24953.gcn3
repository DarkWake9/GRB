Trieste), report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190701ah at T0 = 2019-07-01 20:33:06.578 (UT),
an analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) data shows that the
S190701ah 90% c.l. localization region was entirely occulted by Earth at T0.

Therefore, there are no AGILE-MCAL triggered events related to the GW event
around the LIGO/Virgo T0.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
