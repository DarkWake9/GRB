The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=122203) at 23:09:20 UT on 17 May 2005
is not due to a real GRB or any other astrophysical source.
At this early time in the analysis, we have only the limited data products
that come down via the TDRSS link.  What we can say is that the RA,Dec values
given in the GCN Notices are wrong.  And we believe the BAT lightcurve
has data corruption problems.  It should it also be noted that due
to some of these irregularities in the data, the filtering within GCN
was not complete, and a small fraction of the GCN clients did in fact
receive some notices on this trigger (especially the BAT lightcurve notice).
