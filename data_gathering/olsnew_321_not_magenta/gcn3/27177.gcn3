TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  27177
SUBJECT: GRB 200224A: Tautenburg observations
DATE:    20/02/24 07:37:12 GMT
FROM:    Sylvio Klose at TLS Tautenburg  <klose@tls-tautenburg.de>

B. Stecklum, S. Klose, A. Nicuesa Guelbenzu, and S. Melnikov (all 
Tautenburg) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200224A (T0=03:24:49 UT; Ukwatta et al., GCN 
27173) with the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope equipped with the 
TAUKAM 6k x 6k CCD camera and the wide V-band filter (VB). The 
transmission curve of this filter closely follows the Gaia GBP filter. 
Observations started at 04:09:53 UT and consisted of 5x3 min exposures.

Based on several Gaia DR2 stars in the field within 1 arcmin radius about 
the afterglow position, we measure for the optical transient (Sota et al., 
GCN 27176) at RA, DEC (J2000) = 16:35:04.11, +41:36:42.4 (+/- 0.5 arcsec) 
the following preliminary Vega magnitude:

mean time t = Feb 24, 04:18:01 UT; t-T0 = 53m 12s;  VB = 21.83 +/- 0.10.


[GCN OPS NOTE(24feb20): This is the sixth Circular in the sequence of 8 circulars
which were all labeled A because of the sequence assigner being offline.  
This circular was correctly labelled A.]
