on behalf of the SVOM Gravitational Astronomy group report:

We observed about 5600 square degree (14 sky regions) of the skymap of the
advanced  LIGO trigger G268556, with Mini-GWAC (Mini Ground Wide Angle
Camera), at Xinglong Observatory of NAOC equipped with U9000 camera
(FOV~400 square degree/camera). Mini-GWAC, as a part of ground instruments
of SVOM mission, comprises 12 wide field angle cameras (aperture=7cm),
working with unfiltered band. The observations are operated in time-series
mode, taking one exposure in 15 seconds (10s exposure + 5s readout). The
limit magnitude is ~12 mag in R band. We estimate a 84.4% prior probability
that these 14 regions contain the true location of the source.  The
coordinates of the 14 regions and observation time are list following:

Mini-GWAC is working in sky survey mode. The first image was taken 2 hours
20 minutes after event.  No any significant transient is found in our
online pipeline.
The image analysis is ongoing in detailed processing with our offline
pipeline. Further observations  of these fields are planned.
