K. Misra, S. B. Pandey and Rupak Roy (ARIES, NainiTal, India, on bahalf 
of larger Indian GRB collaboration)

We have imaged the field of Swift GRB 070917 with the 1.04m telescope at 
NainiTal ~ 7.5 hours after the burst (Cummings et al. GCN 6791). 
Observations were performed in R band (5*300 sec) in poor sky conditions.

We notice that the field is crowded and a considerable amount of 
extinction (E(B - V) = 0.45 mag) is there in the burst direction. Visual 
comparison with DSS-II plate does not show any new source within the 
refined error-box (Tueller et al. GCN 6792). Photometry of the co-added 
frame put a 3 sigma upper limit of ~20.5 mag in comparison to the nearby 
USNO A2.0 star 0900-15768267 (R mag 16.6)
