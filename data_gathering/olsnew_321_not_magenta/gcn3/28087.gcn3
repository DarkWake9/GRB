Fermi-LAT detection: Crnogorcevic et al., GCN Circ. 28083;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200711A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 11:04:34.187 UTC on 11 July 2020
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1278500601/).
The burst signal was seen only by the SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a weak pulse which starts at T-0.9 sec and
ends at T+4.0 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
4.2 +- 1.3 sec and 2.1 +- 1.3 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
