We report the discovery of the fast optical transient ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) at coordinates (J2000, <0.5”):

RA = 07:48:19.32 (117.08054d)
Dec = +11:24:34.21 (+11.40949d)

ZTF21aagwbjr was first detected at r=17.11 mag on 2021-02-04 07:07 UT, hereafter labelled T_det, with an upper limit (g > 18.74 mag) 1.9 hours prior. It faded by ~2.1 mag in r-band in the next 0.9 days. The transient was most recently detected on 2021-02-05 06:07 UT at g = 19.70 ± 0.07 mag. The color appears to be red, with g-r~0.4 on 2021-02-05. The Galactic extinction along the line of sight is low, with E(B-V)=0.04 mag (Planck Collaboration et al., 2015).

We note that ZTF21aagwbjr falls in the center of the error region of GRB210204A (GCN 29390), a long burst triggered by Fermi GBM 45 minutes before T_det. ZTF21aagwbjr is temporally and spatially consistent with GRB210204A (see https://zwicky.tf/j0s), and likely the afterglow.

In the table below, we report photometry obtained on images processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al. 2019).

2021-02-04 07:07 | 17.11 | 0.02 | r

ZTF21aagwbjr is located off the Galactic plane, with Galactic latitude b_Gal = 17.7 deg. A possible faint host is listed in the Legacy Survey DR9 catalog (Dey et al. 2019, ApJ, 157, 5), at RA, Dec = 07:48:19.32, 11:24:34.3, with a small separation of 0.1 arcsec from ZTF21aagwbjr. The source has a galaxy morphological classification, according to the DR9 Tractor model. The possible host has reported magnitudes of g=24.60, r=23.74, z=23.26, and a photometric redshift of 0.92 ± 0.3.

We encourage spectroscopic classification and multi-wavelength follow-up of ZTF21aagwbjr, the likely afterglow of GRB210204A.


ZTF21aagwbjr was observed as part of the Caltech TESS shadowing survey (ATel #12952), and identified independently by two ZTF data mining programs: i) the “ZTF Realtime Search and Triggering” (ZTF-ReST) project, which aims at near real-time identification of compelling kilonova candidates in ZTF data using the methods described in Andreoni et al. (2020, ApJ, 904, 2), independently of gravitational-wave or gamma-ray triggers; ii) a filtering algorithm designed for fast transient discovery (Ho et al. 2020, ApJ, 905, 2).
