D. Pooley (UCB) and J. S. Bloom report:

"Inspection of the Swift UVOT Quicklook for GRB 050412 reveals a rapidly
fading source at position:
  12:04:31.5
  -01:11:53.8

This is not in the XRT error box. Further astrometric and photometric
calibrations are ongoing. For reference, there is a nearby source (with
the current astrometric solution from the Quicklook) at:
