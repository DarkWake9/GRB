Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080727A (trigger #318094)
(Immler, et al., GCN Circ. 8021).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 208.416, -18.572 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 53m 39.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -18d 34' 18.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single weak pulse starting 
at T+~0 and ending a T+~5 sec.  
T90 (15-350 keV) is 4.9 +- 1.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+5.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.25 +- 0.34.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.20 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
