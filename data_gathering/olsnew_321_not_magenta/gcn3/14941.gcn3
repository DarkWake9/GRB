D.Byrne (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:55:05.93 UT on 27 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130627A (trigger 394016108 / 130627372),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Oates et al. 2013, GCN 14933).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of a multiple pulses,
with a duration (T90) of about 28 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-13.31 s to T0+14.34 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.4 +/- 0.2 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 86 +/- 25 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.334 +/- 0.185)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.28 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.17 +/- 0.25 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
