The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S190928c is not considered to be a gravitational wave signal.
No notices or circulars were sent for this candidate due to problems with
the GCN server. The trigger was briefly public on the GraceDB server before
being retracted during the vetting process. To avoid confusion, it was
temporarily removed from public view.

The trigger was not confirmed by detailed offline cWB [1] analysis.

We have restored the superevent record to be publicly visible on the
GraceDB server.
