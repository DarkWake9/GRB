report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190727h at T0 = 2019-07-27 06:03:33
UTC (UT),
a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data
found no
event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the
LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 80% of the S190727h 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to
the AGILE-MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s
integration
time at different celestial positions within the accessible S190727h
localization
region, from a minimum of 1.6E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.4E-06 erg
cm^-2 (assuming
as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy
range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
