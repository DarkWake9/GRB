report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

AGILE observed the long GRB 190829A at T0 = 2019-08-29 19:55:53 (UT)
first reported by Fermi GBM (GCN 25551) and by Swift (GCN 25552).
The scientific ratemeters of the Anti-Coincidence (50-200 keV) and
Super-AGILE (SA; 18-60 keV) detected the burst.
The GRB 190829A was also seen at VHE gamma-ray energy by
H.E.S.S.(GCN 25566).

The GRB location was fully accessible to the AGILE MCAL, but no trigger
occured around +/- 100 sec from T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration
time at different celestial positions from a minimum of
1.16E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 1.36E-06 erg cm^-2
(assuming as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in
the energy range 0.4-100 MeV.

The GRB 190829A  position has optimal exposure also in the AGILE
field of View of the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and
further analyses are still in progress.
