A. Horesh (Weizmann Institute), L. P. Singer (Caltech), S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC),  M. M. Kasliwal (Carnegie Observatories/Princeton), and D. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration: 

We observed iPTF14aue, the afterglow candidate of GRB140508A (Yu & Goldstein, GCN 16224; Hurley et al., GCN 16225; Singer et al., GCN 16226) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The observations were undertaken on 2014 May 13 UT, 5.2 days after the Fermi trigger. We detected the source at 6.1 GHz (C-band) with a flux of 127 +/- 9 micro Jy. The source was also detected at 22 GHz (K-band). 

We thank the VLA staff for scheduling this target of opportunity.
