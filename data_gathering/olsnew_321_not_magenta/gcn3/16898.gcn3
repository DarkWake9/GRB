S. Schmidl (TLS Tautenburg), J. F. Graham, and J. Greiner
(both MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 141005A (Swift trigger 614415; V. D'Elia et
al., GCN #16882) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al.
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG telescope at ESO La Silla
Observatory (Chile).

We detect a source consistant with the position reported by Perley et al.
(GCN #16884). From coadded observations, starting on October 05 and
spanning from 23:50 to 00:04 UT, we report the following preliminary
magnitudes and upper limits (AB magnitude system) of:

g' > 21.6,
r' = 21.7 +/- 0.2,
i' = 21.7 +/- 0.2,
z' = 21.2 +/- 0.2,
J  > 20.5,
H  > 19.9, and
K  > 18.2.

Given magnitudes and upper limits are calibrated against SDSS as well as
2MASS field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic
foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.17 mag in
the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
