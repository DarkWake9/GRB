the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and HEND observed this burst at 64234 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~1.5 s, which
probably places it in the short-duration, hard spectrum GRB category.
Its 25-100 keV fluence was ~6E-6 erg/cm^2, and its peak flux over
0.5 s was ~1.4E-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to a
preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area is ~ 25 square arcminutes,
whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 19 h 31 m 15.61 s      4 o 55 '   6.19 "  (CENTER)
 19 h 31 m 52.52 s      4 o 58 '  39.23 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 30 m 51.29 s      4 o 54 '   1.77 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 31 m 39.88 s      4 o 56 '  10.05 "  (CORNER)
 19 h 30 m 38.55 s      4 o 51 '  31.67 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
