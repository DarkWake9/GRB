Using the data set from T-190 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170419A (trigger #748898)
(Sbarufatti et al., GCN Circ. 21013).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 79.854, -21.433 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  05h 19m 25.1s
  Dec(J2000) = -21d 25' 58.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 53%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0. The main emission ends at ~T+3 s, with a tail that
lasts till ~T+9 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.18 +- 2.00 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.39 to T+8.92 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.06 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.47 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
