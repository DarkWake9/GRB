The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:28:39 UT on 16 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200916A (trigger 621977324.956902 / 200916812).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 41.5, Dec = -4.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 46m, -4d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 96.0 degrees.
