E. Sonbas (NASA/GSFC/Adiyaman Univ.) report on behalf of the Swift
Team:

At 07:30:57 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140209A (trigger=586071).  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 81.335, +32.477 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 25m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = +32d 28' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~43000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 04:37 UT on 2014 February 11. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. B. Cenko (brad.cenko AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
