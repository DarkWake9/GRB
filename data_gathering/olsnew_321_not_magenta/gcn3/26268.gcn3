V. Shenoy (IITB), Y. Sharma (Caltech), V. Bhalerao (IITB), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed a strong detection of a short GRB 191119A.

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed single pulse of emission peaking at 2019-11-19 10:41:04.0 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 1798 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 338 cts. The local mean background count rate was 469 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 0.23 s.

It was also detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

There is no event reported at this time in Fermi sub-threshold triggers list.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
