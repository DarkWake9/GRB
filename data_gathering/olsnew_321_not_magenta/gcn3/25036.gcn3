A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 190706D has been detected by
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS trigger 8326), Konus-Wind,
and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 61381 s UT (17:03:01).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   324.618 (21h 38m 28s)  +9.901 ( +9d 54' 02")
  Corners:
   329.663 (21h 58m 39s)  +2.806 ( +2d 48' 22")
   334.060 (22h 16m 14s)  +7.015 ( +7d 00' 54")
   317.812 (21h 11m 15s) +15.409 (+15d 24' 34")
   312.109 (20h 48m 26s)  +9.995 ( +9d 59' 42")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is about 113 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 21.9 deg (the minimum one is 6 deg).
The Sun distance was about 130 deg.

This box may be improved.

The main fraction of the box was Earth occulted for Fermi.

This burst is spatially and temporally inconsistent with
LIGO/Virgo S190706ai (LVC GCN Circ. 24998) and
LIGO/Virgo S190707q (LVC GCN Circ. 25012).

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
