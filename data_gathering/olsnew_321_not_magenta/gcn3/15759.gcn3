MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in Blagoveschensk was pointed to the  GRB140122A (Fermi trigger 
412093190) 23 sec after notice time and 50 sec after trigger time at 
2014-01-22 14:20:37.228 UT. On our first (10s exposure) set we haven`t 
found optical transient  within 2 sq. degree part in middle part of  FERMI 
error-box (ra=03 36 07 dec=+15 27 00 r=5.26) with 5-sigma upper limit has 
been about 15.5 mag on first single image and 17.0m on coadd image  of 
first 6 sets with total exposure 230 sec.   So small covered area due to 
observations in polaroid bands, which cover only 25% of our FOV.

The coordinates of the MASTER II image centers (2.1 degrees rectangle):

03h 37m 16.9s +15d 34m 55s

03h 34m 11.7s +15d 25m 53s

Also we cover 95% of 1-sigma statistical + systematic FERMI  errorbox 
using MASTER VWF robotic very wide field cameras (FOV=2x384 square 
degrees, D=72mm, f/1.4, 1 pix = 22 arcsec, http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
installed on MASTER-II robotic telescope in  same time.  No credible 
transients have been found on our images. The 3 sigma upper limit on 
single 10 seconds exposure image is 10.5 and 12.0 on coadd of 15 images 
with total exposure 150 seconds.
The positions of first two iPTF optical afterglow candidates (Singer et 
al., GCN15758 ) are covered by out cameras since 50 sec. after the trigger 
but there are no flares up to 12.0 mag. on their place.
