report

We used SMA to observe the location of the Swift/XRT source #3 
(Evans, GCN Circ. 28015) as one of the afterglow candidates of
GRB200623A (Fermi/GBM Team, GCN Circ. 28011; DeLaunay et al., GCN
Circ. 28013, 28016).  The 230 GHz observation was started at ~1 days
after the burst.  No clear submm source at the Swift/XRT sources #3
position was found brighter than ~1 mJy.

We thank the staff of SMA.
