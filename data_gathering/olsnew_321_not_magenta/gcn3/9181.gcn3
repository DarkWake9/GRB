Global-rent-a-scope GRAS002 Tak Mewlon 0.30m telescope with SBIG ST-8E

CCD at Mayhill (New Mexico, USA) was used for follow-up observations of 

GRB090418B. The observations were started on April 19, at 03:55 UTC (19 hours

after the burst) and stopped at 05:35 UTC. Four unfiltered 600 seconds images

were taken.  We do not detect any new object with respect to POSSII F/USNO-B1.0

inside the BAT error circle. Upper limit for the observations is > 20.5 mag (3UL). Quoted

upper limit has been derived using POSSII F and USNO-B1.0 field stars as reference.
