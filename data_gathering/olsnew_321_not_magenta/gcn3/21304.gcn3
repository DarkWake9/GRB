Konus-Wind (KW) was observing the whole sky at the time of the LIGO
event G288732 (2017-06-08 02:01:16.492 UTC, hereafter T0;
LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration GCN Circ. 21221).

No triggered KW event happened from ~3 hours before to ~2.6 days
after T0. The closest waiting-mode event was ~7.5 hour after T0.
Using waiting-mode data within the interval T0 +/- 100 s,
we found no significant (> 5 sigma) excess over the background
in both KW detectors on temporal scales from 2.944 s to 100 s.

We estimate an upper limit (90% conf.) on the 10 keV â€“ 10 MeV fluence
to 8.3x10^-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 2.944 s and having a
typical KW short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with
alpha=-0.5 and Ep=500 keV). For a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band
function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the corresponding
limiting peak flux is 3.0x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (10 keV - 10 MeV, 2.944 s scale).

All the quoted values are preliminary.
