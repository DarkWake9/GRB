TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

P. A. Evans reports,

The enhanced XRT position for GRB 081021 just reported (GCN Circ. 7124)
was not the position of the GRB afterglow. This source is a serendipitous
source. We apologise for any confusion.

We are implementing further checks to ensure that circulars are only issued for
GRB afterglow candidates. Details of the XRT enhancement process are provided at
