L.  Vetere (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:00:21 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060322 (trigger=202442).  Swift did not slew to this burst
because the location is within the Moon observing constraint (8 deg).
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 274.245, -36.697
{18h 16m 59s, -36d 41' 50"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 
3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).
The BAT light curve shows a double episode of multi-peak structures.
The first episode starts at T-10 sec and lasts to T+35 sec.
The second episode starts at T+155 sec and lasts to T+200.  The total
duration is about 210 sec.  We note that this location is near
the Galactic Bulge, but that the light curve is much more like
a GRB than any galactic x-ray bursting source.  The peak count rate
was ~1600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger in the first
episode and the same rate at T+180 sec in the second episode.

This location will come out of Moon constraint at 09:00 24 Mar 06.
