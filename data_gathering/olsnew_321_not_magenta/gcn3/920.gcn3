A. Oksanen and M. Moilanen (Nyrölä Observatory GRB-team),
H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ. VSNET GRB-team), and
A. Henden (USRA/USNO) report:

We have observed the entire IPN error box of GRB010119 
(Hurley et al., GCN 916) as part
of the monitoring effort by the AAVSO GRB network.
This GRB was of the short-hard variety and so is of
considerable interest.  However, at a galactic latitude
and longitude of bII=4.9, lII=43.9, the burst occurred
in a dense starfield with no visible background galaxies,
indicating considerable extinction.
  The observation was made with the Nyrölä Observatory
0.4-m telescope and Rc-filter on 010121.17 UT, between
the two Palomar observations reported by Price, et al.
(GCN 919).  A total of 12 two-minute exposures were stacked,
yielding a limiting magnitude of approximately R=19.5 in
3.4arcsec seeing.  The resultant image can be found at

All objects on this image are also visible in the
scans of the POSS-2 red plate from the NOFS PMM pixel server.
