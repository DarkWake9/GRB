report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:19:54.47 UT on 30 March 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140330A (trigger 417845997 / 140330180),
which was also detected by Konus-Wind (S. Golenetskii et al, GCN 16056)
and localized by the Interplanetary Network (K. Hurley et al, GCN 16051).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the IPN location.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 13.6 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a FRED pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 34 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.768 s to T0+35.073 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.66 +/- 0.10 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 197 +/- 17 keV.
(Castor statistics 578.62 for 486 d.o.f.).
A Band function fits the spectrum equally well (Castor statistics
577.22 for 485 d.o.f.) with Epeak= 172 +/- 23 keV,
alpha = -0.57 +/- 0.13 and beta = -2.4 +/- 0.3.
This result is consistent with the analysis of the Konus observation
(S. Golenetskii et al, GCN 16056).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.6 +/- 0.3)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.640 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
