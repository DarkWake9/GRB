We have carried out optical observations of the field of GRB 040511 
(HETE trigger #3218, GCN 2588) using the C2 CCD Camera (12'x 12') 
mounted on the Swiss 1.2-meter telescope located at the ESO La Silla 
Observatory (Chile), beginning at 22:58 UT on 2004 May 11 (9.93 hours 
after the burst). We obtained four R filtered images, with exposure 
times of 180 and 480 s.

The comparison between these images with the USNO-A2 catalog does not 
reveal any new source down to a limiting magnitude of R < 19.4 inside 
the 80" error circle around the position provided by the HETE SXC Ground 
analysis (GCN 2588).
