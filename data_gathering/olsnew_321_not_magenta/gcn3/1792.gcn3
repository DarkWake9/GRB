K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 83938 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  8 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  8.9E-7 erg/cm2 s over 0.5 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA, Decl(2000)=
1.888, -37.630 degrees, whose radius is 14.843 +/- .137 degrees (3 sigma ).

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival direction
to a band between ecliptic latitudes -20 and -40 degrees, that is, to those
portions of the annulus north of RA, Decl= 349, -49 and 20, -35 degrees.

This annulus can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
