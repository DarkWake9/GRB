report:

We have analyzed the full 94.0 ksec (livetime) Chandra LETGS 
observation of GRB030328 (Villasenor et al, GCN1978), lasting from 
March 29.112 (t[burst] + 15.33 hr) until March 30.278 (t[burst] + 
43.32 hr).  The mean counting rate for the X-ray afterglow (Butler et 
al. GCN2007) is 0.012 counts/s (summed over the dispersed signal from 
the LETGS, and including the 0th order flux).  We observe that the 
brightness over the full observation decays with a slope -1.5 +/- 
0.1, consistent with the value reported by Ford et al. (GCN2027). 
(The chi^2 is 34.27 for 30 degrees of freedom, and the fit is 
rejectable at only 73% confidence.)  We see no evidence for a 
temporal break.  We fit the dispersed LETGS counts (+/-1 orders 
summed) and the counts in 0th order jointly by minimizing chi^2, 
requiring 12 or more counts per spectral bin.  In the 0.5 to 3.0 keV 
band, the data are well fit (chi^2/nu=48.45/48, rejectable at 54% 
confidence) by an absorbed power-law:

dN/dE = A * E^ (-gamma) * exp(-NH * sigma[E]) ,

where NH = ( 5 +/- 3 ) x 10^20 cm^(-2) is the line of sight column 
density, which is consistent with the anticipated galactic absorption 
in the source direction; A = ( 6.8 +/- 0.9 ) x 10^(-5) ph cm^(-2) 
s^(-1) keV^(-1); and gamma = 1.7 +/- 0.2 .  These are 1 parameter 
1-sigma confidence intervals.

Integrating the above model over the 0.5 to 3.0 keV band, the mean 
flux for the duration of the Chandra observation is ~1.9 x 10^(-13) 
ergs cm^(-2) s^(-1).

Our analyses are continuing, and more detailed results will be posted at:

We thank Harvey Tananbaum for his generous allocation of Director's 
Discretion Time to this observation, and the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory Operations personnel for the impressive promptness with 
which this observation was planned and carried out.

The preliminary results reported here may be cited.
