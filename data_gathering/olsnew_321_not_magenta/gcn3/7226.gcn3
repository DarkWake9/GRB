G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:06:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible GRB 080129 (trigger=301981). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 105.280, -7.827 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 07h 01m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = -07d 49' 35"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve for this event appears
to show a duration of about 80 sec with a peak of ~600 counts/sec 
(15-350 keV), at ~30 sec after the trigger although, as is usual
for image triggers, the TDRSS light curve is noisy. 
The location of the source, 1.4 degrees from the Galactic plane
raises the possibility that this is a Galactic transient. 
Further analysis will require the downlinked data from Malindi. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products
to analyze.  Swift will slew to this position at about T+3006 s, or 
about 06:56 UT. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Immler (immler AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
