The LCO 2-m unit at Haleakala Observatory (Hawaii) automatically began 
observing Swift GRB 180721A (Sbarufatti et al. GCN 22994) on July 21, 
11:21:40 UT (14.9 minutes after the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS i' 
filter. Within the Swift-XRT error circle we do not detect any source 
down to i'>20.2 mag at a mid time of 20.4 minutes post GRB with a 5x120s 
exposure, as calibrated against nearby SDSS objects.
