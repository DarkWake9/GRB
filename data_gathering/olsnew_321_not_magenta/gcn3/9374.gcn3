of the Swift Team:

At 08:27:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090516 (trigger=352190).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 138.271, -11.858 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 09h 13m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 51' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multiple-peaked
structure with a duration of at least 150 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger, with 
additional prominent peaks at T+35, T+90 and T+135. 

The XRT began observing the field at 08:30:37.4 UT, 166.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright, fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 138.26119, -11.85480 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 09h 13m 2.69s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 51' 17.3"
with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 36 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
4.47e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 0.1 s image was 1.96e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 176 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.05.
