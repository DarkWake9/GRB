A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), P. Curran (MSSL), K. Wiersema (U. Leicester)
and P. Groot (Nijmegen) report:

"We observed the location of the short GRB 090621B (Curran et al. GCN
9545) with the WHT, beginning at 23:48:33 UT. Observations were
obtained in the i-band, with a total exposure time of 1800s. Inside
the XRT error box we find a faint object at

RA = 20 53 53.07 
Dec = +69 01 40.8

with errors of approximately 0.5" in each axis. The object is
significantly fainter than the DSSII limit, and shows no obvious
variability between the first and last exposures (taken ~1.7 and
~2.3 hours post burst). Given the relatively high foreground
extinction the probability of a chance alignment within the XRT
error box is non-trivial. Hence we are unable to make strong
statements about the association of this source with GRB 090621B 
at this stage."
