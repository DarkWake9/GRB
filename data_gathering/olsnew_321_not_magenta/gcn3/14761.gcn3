S. B. Cenko (GSFC) and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the short-hard GRB 130603B (Melandri et al.,
GCN 14735) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Images were
obtained in the r' and i' filters beginning at 04:00 on 2013 June 4 (~
12.2 hr after the Swift trigger).

At the location of the optical afterglow (Levan et al., GCN 14742), we
detect a source mildly blended with the presumed host galaxy.  Using a
large aperture to include both objects, we measure a magnitude of r' =
20.8 at this time (calibrated with respect to several nearby point sources
from SDSS).
