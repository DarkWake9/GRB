P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 819 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT
image for GRB 100213B, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 124.28226, +43.44773 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 08h 17m 7.74s
Dec (J2000): +43d 26' 51.8"

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This position
is 3.7" from the object reported by Malesani et al. (GCN Circ. 10413) and
Cucchiara et al (GCN Circ. 10422).

Position enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and
Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

This circular  is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
