A. de Ugarte Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), D. B. Malesani 
(DTU Space), D. A. Kann (HETH/IAA-CSIC) report on behalf 
of the Stargate collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 190611A (Dâ€™Elia et al. GCN 24785) 
with FORS2, mounted on UT1 (Antu) of ESO VLT (Paranal 
observatory). Two V-band images were obtained in search of the 
possible afterglow, at a mean epoch of 12 June 08:10:32 UT 
(14.36 hr after the burst). In the combined exposure of 180s, no 
new source was detected within the enhanced XRT error circle 
(Goad et al. GCN 24786) down to a 3-sigma limit of V(AB) = 24.0 
mag. Photometric calibration was performed with respect to field 
stars from the NOMAD catalogue.
