The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:20:00 UT on 11 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220411A (trigger 671354405.530438 / 220411306).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 178.2, Dec = 25.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 52m, 25d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 6.0 degrees.
