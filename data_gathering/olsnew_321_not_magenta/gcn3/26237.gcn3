and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S191110af, T0 = 2019-11-10 23:06:44.183 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 26222), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-1 min to T0+31 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high 
energy trigger mode at the trigger time of S191110af. Using
the CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in the
10-100 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger 
time and found no candidates in the overwrap region with the
LIGO-Virgo high probability localization region.  The 90% upper
limit of CAL is 8.4x10^-6 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) when the
summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 40%. The CAL FOV
was centered at RA= 218.6 deg, DEC= -42.7 deg at T0.
