Adria C. Updike (Clemson University), G. Grant Williams (MMTO
Observatory), Peter A. Milne (Steward Observatory), and Dieter H. Hartmann
(Clemson University) report:

The 0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory began
observing the field of GRB 090429B 40 seconds after the trigger (Ukwatta
et al., GCN 9281) under good conditions.  Observations consisted sets of
10, 20, and 60 second exposures.  No new sources are found in the XRT
error circle.
The results of the stacked exposures are given below; time is given in
seconds after the trigger (midtime of stack).  Magnitudes were determined
relative to the USNO B1.0 catalog.
