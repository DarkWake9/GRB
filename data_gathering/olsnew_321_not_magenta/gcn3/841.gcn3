K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 17927 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approx. 375 seconds,
a 25-100 keV fluence of approx. 3.3E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
over 0.5 s of 7.1E-07 erg/cm2 s.  We have triangulated it to
a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose area is approx. 40
sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  4 h  5 m 52.26 s    -21 o 54 '  22.76 "  (CENTER)
  4 h  5 m 43.95 s    -21 o 53 '  46.46 "  (CORNER)
  4 h  6 m 21.73 s    -21 o 46 '  23.26 "  (CORNER)
  4 h  5 m 22.81 s    -22 o  2 '  21.58 "  (CORNER)
  4 h  6 m  0.58 s    -21 o 54 '  59.04 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
