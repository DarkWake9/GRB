(ASDC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Maselli  (INAF-IASFPA), B. Sbarufatti
(INAF-OAB/PSU) and D. Malesani report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 160504A (Malesani et al.
GCN Circ. 19382), from 80 s to 18.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 31 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Goad et al.
(GCN Circ. 19386).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=2.4 (+1.2, -3.4). At T+100 s  the decay
steepens to an alpha of 5.5 (+0.9, -0.7). The light curve breaks again
at T+209 s to a decay with alpha=0.15 (+0.08, -0.65),  before a final
break at T+4742 s s after which the decay index is 0.68 (+0.15, -0.14).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.97 (+/-0.15). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.1 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 8.1 x 10^19 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.4 x 10^-11 (4.2 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.1 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 8.1 x 10^19 cm^-2
Excess significance: 4.4 sigma
Photon index:	     1.97 (+/-0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.68, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.022 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 7.5 x
10^-13 (9.3 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
