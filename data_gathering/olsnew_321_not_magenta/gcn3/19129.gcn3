S. Dichiara (U. Ferrara, ICRANet), C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi
(LJMU), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath), on behalf of a
larger collaboration report:

The 2-m LCOGT Faulkes Telescope North began observing Swift GRB 160303A
(Beardmore et al., GCN 19126) on March 03, 11:18 UT (23 minutes after the
burst trigger) with i' filter. Inside the XRT error circle we find no
source down to i'> 21.2 mag in a 5x120s exposure (at 28.7 min, mid time),
as calibrated against nearby SDSS stars, in agreement with the limits
reported by Elenin et al. (GCN 19127).
