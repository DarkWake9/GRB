report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2018-11-19T14:32:27.200 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181119A (trigger ID: HEB181119605) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (trigger number 564330742)

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 14.82 s measured from T0-10.03 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+4.79 s, is 680.6 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 2060.5 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
