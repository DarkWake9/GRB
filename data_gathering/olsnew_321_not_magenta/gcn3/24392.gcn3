SUBJECT: IceCube-190504A - IceCube observation of a high-energy neutrino candidate event

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 19/05/04 18:25:18.39 UT IceCube detected a track-like, very-high-energy event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was identified by the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) selection. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state. HESE events have a neutrino vertex inside of the detector (to reduce background) and have a high light level (a proxy for energy).

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/766165_132518.amon), the detailed angular uncertainty is still being evaluated and will be published later. At this time we propose to use the preliminary values reported in the GCN Notice:

Date: 19/05/04
Time: 18:25:18.39 UT 
RA:  65.7866 (J2000)
Dec:  -37.4431 (J2000)
Error radius: 73.79 arcmin (90% containment)

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
