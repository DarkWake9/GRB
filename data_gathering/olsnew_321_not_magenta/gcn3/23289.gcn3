S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), D. M. Palmer (LANL)
and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

Swift BAT trigger 864882 is not an interesting astrophysical event. 
It is a detection of the Crab at normal intensity levels that
was mis-identified as being above threshold.
