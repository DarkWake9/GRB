report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 10:37:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located MAXI J1348-630 (trigger=885807).  Swift slewed immediately 
to the source. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 207.003, -63.265 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 48m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 15' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure.  The peak count rate was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), 
at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 10:48:44.0 UT, 650.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. The XRT centroided on a cosmic ray, so the automatic 
position notice is incorrect. There are no other data available at 
this time. 

There are no UVOT data available at this time. 

This source was discovered by MAXI at 03:16 UT this morning (ATel 12425)
