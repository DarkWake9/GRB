SUBJECT: GRB 140808A: Confirmation of the Swift-XRT afterglow

K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and S.B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

In GCN Circ. 16670, Page et al. reported the detection of an X-ray source
coincident with the iPTF optical source suggested to be the afterglow of
Fermi GRB 140808A (Singer et al., GCN Circ. 16668; Zhang, GCN Circ.
16669).

Starting 224 ks after the Fermi trigger, a second epoch of XRT data was
collected. The X-ray source is now no longer detected, having faded below
a 3-sigma upper limit of 2.46 x 10^-3 count s^-1 (0.3-10 keV). We
therefore confirm that this is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 140808A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
