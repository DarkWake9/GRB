The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:24:57 UT on 19 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190519A (trigger 579943502.3431 / 190519309).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 114.9, Dec = -35.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 39m, -35d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 85.0 degrees.
