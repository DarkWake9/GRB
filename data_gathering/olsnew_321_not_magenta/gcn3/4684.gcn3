The list of sources from the first 72-second V UVOT finding chart
exposure contains a bright, uncataloged optical source coincident
with the position reported by Fynbo et al (GCN 4683).

The UVOT source position is
         RA(2000) 202.9309
         Dec(2000) 35.0510

The mean positional error between known sources in the field and catalog
entries is 0.47".

The V magnitude is estimated to be approximately 16.7. No correction
has been made for the expected extinction of about 0.04 magnitudes.
