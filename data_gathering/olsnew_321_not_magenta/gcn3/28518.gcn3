The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:57:59.00 UT on 28 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200928A (trigger 622969084/ 200928290). This trigger was initially classified as Below Horizon event by the flight software, but is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 58.9, Dec = -14.4(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 3 h 56 m, -14 d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 68 degrees.
