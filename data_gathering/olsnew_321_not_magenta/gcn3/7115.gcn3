C. Guidorzi, P. Romano (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB),
A. Moretti (INAF-OAB) and T.N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU),
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We recalculated the XRT refined position of GRB 071117
(trigger=296805, Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 7098)
by excluding the first orbit data, which were affected
by the presence of a dead pixel column.
In 8.3 ks of Photon Counting mode data spanning 8.7-28 ks after
the trigger the position of the X-ray afterglow is
RA,Dec =335.04336,-63.44278 degrees, which corresponds to

RA(J2000) =  22 20 10.41
Dec(J2000)= -63 26 34.0

with error circle of radius 3.8 arcsec (90%, including
boresight uncertainties). The optical afterglow reported by
Bloom et al. (GCN Circ. 7110) now lies 1.5" away from the new
XRT centroid.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
