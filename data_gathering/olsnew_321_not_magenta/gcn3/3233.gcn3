 "The error region of GRB 050401 (Angelini, et al. GCN 3161; Barbier,
et al. GCN 3162) was observed with the ART 14-inch telescope. BVRcIc
imaging started at 2005 April 1, 14:22:23 UT (128-s after trigger) and
60-s exposure in each filter was repeated.

 The optical afterglow (McNaught & Price GCN 3163) is not detected in
our frames and the following 3-sigma upper limits are derived relative
to USNO-B1.0 magnitudes.
