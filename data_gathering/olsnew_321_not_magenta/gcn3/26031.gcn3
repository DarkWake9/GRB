and A. Tohuvavohu (Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 15:12:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191019A (trigger=930285).  Swift did not slew due to an observing
constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 340.038, -17.333, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 40m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 19' 59"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks in a FRED
envelope with a total duration of about 80 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+51.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. K. Simpson (kira.simpson1984 AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
