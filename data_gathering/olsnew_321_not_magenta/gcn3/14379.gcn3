SUBJECT: GRB 130418A: Bassano Bresciano Observatory optical observations
DATE:    13/04/18 21:58:31 GMT
FROM:    Ulisse Quadri at Bassano Bresciano Obs  <oabb@ulisse.bs.it>

U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130418A (de Pasquale et al. 2013; GCN
Circ. 14377) detected by SWIFT(trigger 553847) with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy.

The observations started 15 min. after the 
GRB trigger,with our schmidt telescope 
D=400 mm F/D=3.

Weather conditions were discrete for moon presence.

We co-added 14 unfiltered CCD exposures of 120s each.

We detect a new source of 16.3 Vmag in the error box given by SWIFT.
We detected the candidate couterpart at the following position (+/- 2 arcsec):

RA (J2000.0) =  09h 56m 08.90s 
DEC(J2000.0) = +13Â° 40' 02.8"

Magnitudes were estimated with the USNO-B1 cat. 
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
