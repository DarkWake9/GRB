K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and H.A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) report on 
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT started observing the field of the SuperAGILE GRB 081001 
(Lazzarotto et al., GCN Circ. 8305) 15.5 ks after the trigger. A single, 
fading source was identified within the SuperAGILE error circle, which we 
identify as the X-ray afterglow.

Using 4307 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 4 UVOT images, we find 
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment 
and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 
276.59076, -8.71903 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):   18 26 21.78
Dec (J2000): -08 43 08.5

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
