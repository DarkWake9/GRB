TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 080405: Swift-XRT position

V. La Parola, B. Sbarufatti, V. Mangano (INAF-IASF PA) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team.

The XRT began observing GRB 080405 (Cummings et al., GCN 7564) on
2008-04-07 at 04:25:49, ~43 hours after the trigger. The observation
is in PC mode and consists of 1.5 ksec split over two orbits. A
single uncatalogued source is detected in the whole XRT field of view,
with coordinates:
RA  = 10:50:23.64  (162.59850)
Dec = -04:17:18.5  (-4.288476)
with an uncertainty of 7.1 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This
position lies 2.3 arcmin from the BAT position (slightly outside the
BAT error circle).
The source has a count rate of 1.029E-02 ± 2.9E-03 c/s, corresponding to
an unabsorbed flux of 4.63e-13 ergs/s/cm-2  (assuming a standard
powerlaw spectrum with index 2.0 and a Galactic line of sight absorbing
column of 3.8e20 cm-2).
With these data we cannot assess if the source is decaying.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
