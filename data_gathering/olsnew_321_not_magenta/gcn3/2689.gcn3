TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2689
SUBJECT: GRB 040827 - Radio Observations
DATE:    04/09/01 17:50:41 GMT
FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

A. Soderberg (Caltech) and D. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of
a larger Caltech/NRAO/Carnegie collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 040827 (GCN 2670) with the
Very Large Array on August 31.98 UT. We do not detect
a radio counterpart to the X-ray/NIR afterglow candidate
(GCNs 2678,2680) and place an upper limit of 70 microJy
(2-sigma) at the position of the NIR transient.

One radio source is detected within the Integral error
circle (GCN 2672), with flux density 240 +- 35 microJy
at:

	RA: 15:16:56.77   Dec: -16:08:56.7 (J2000).

which is likely to be a pre-existing source, based on
the observed number density of radio sources across the
sky and the size of the Integral error circle."
