We are following up the GraceDB event (event UID: G268556) with Nanshan One-meter Wide field Telescope (NOWT) from Xinjiang Astronomical observatory (XAO). V band with 180s is used during this survey observation, and the maximum probability northern-skymap (Submitted by GraceDB Processor on Jan 4, 2017 3:07:44 PM) with 100 square degree is covered.


By cross-certification using the UCAC3 catalogue, here we reported two new transients close to Tonry et al., (LVC Circ. 20382) with 35", which were named as EWE001 and EWE002.

EWE001: HJD               RA(Deg.)         DEC(Deg.)      V_mag       M_err    
        2457761.12729148  138.30136        61.098523      15.024      0.086

EWE001: HJD               RA(Deg.)         DEC(Deg.)      V_mag       M_err    
        2457761.12729148  138.32121        61.098307      14.090      0.039

 Analysis and survey are ongoing.
