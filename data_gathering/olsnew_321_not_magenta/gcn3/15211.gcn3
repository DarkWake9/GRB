G.E. Anderson, R.P. Fender, T.D. Staley (University of Southampton),
A.J. van der Horst and B.A. Rowlinson (University of Amsterdam)
report on behalf of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 130907A afterglow at 15 GHz with
the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager at September 8 09.90 UT to 11.90 UT,
i.e. 12.2 - 14.2 hours after the burst (GCN 15183).
We detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
(GCN 15187) with a flux density of 1.06 +/- 0.11 mJy.

These observations were triggered via the system described in
Staley et. al (2013, MNRAS, 428, 3114).
Further follow-up observations are planned."
