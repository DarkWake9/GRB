During a follow-up observation on the SGR1806-20,
the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on Swift has detected two more outbursts,
indicating that this source is still in an active phase 
11 days after the 041227 giant flare.  Each burst was ~0.1 second 
long and was within BAT's partially-coded (35%) field of view
(fully-coded viewing was prevented by the Sun observing constraint).

At 2005-01-07 02:08:21 a small outburst (0.4 counts/cm^2, 15-100 keV)
was localized on-board at RA=272.154, DEC=-20.374 (J2000) (6 arcmin
from the VLA position, Gaensler et al., 2005 GCN#2920).

At 2005-01-07 13:12:27 a larger but softer outburst (1.6 counts/cm^2, 
15-100 keV) was localized on-board at RA=272.156, DEC=-20.409 (J2000)
(0.5 arcmin from the VLA position).
