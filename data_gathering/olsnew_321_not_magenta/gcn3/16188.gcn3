of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short-duration GRB 140428B (IPN triangulation: Golenetskii et al., 
GCN 16184) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=78275.456 s UT (21:44:35.456).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a total
duration of ~0.15 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 9.23(-0.95,+0.88)x10^-7 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.014 s,
of (1.43 +/- 0.38)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1.2 MeV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.80 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) yields
alpha = -0.75(-0.24, +0.26), and
Ep = 1050(-343,+1750) keV

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the quoted results are preliminary.
