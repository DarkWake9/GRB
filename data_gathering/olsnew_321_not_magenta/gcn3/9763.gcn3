The MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope performed a follow-up
observation of the BAT burst GRB090621A (Curran et al., GCN Circ. 9540).
The burst was also triggered by Fermi-GBM (Arne Rau, GCN Circ. 9556)
We received the GCN alert at 04:23:38 UT (T0+55s). Data taking with MAGIC 
started at 04:36:18 UT (T0+815s), when the GRB zenith angle reached
46 degrees. The observation continued for 1833 s.

No evidence for VHE gamma-ray emission above the analysis threshold
of 196 GeV was found. The observation was carried out in twilight 
condition.

A preliminary analysis, for the hypothesis of steady emission and 
assumption of a differential photon spectral index of -2.5, yields the 
following 95% CL differential flux upper limits, including a 30% 
systematic uncertainty on the telescope efficiency:

E(175 - 300  GeV): 0.25 * 10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1
E(300 - 1000 GeV): 0.10 * 10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1
for the whole time of observation (from 04:36:18 UT to 05:06:51 UT).

We can also exclude emission of a constant flux in any 100s time bin 
smaller than:

E(175 - 300  GeV):  2.74 * 10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1
E(300 - 1000 GeV):  1.01 * 10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1
for a time window from 04:36:18 UT to 05:06:51 UT
