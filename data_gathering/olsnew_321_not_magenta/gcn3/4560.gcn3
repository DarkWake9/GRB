V. Mangano, V. La Parola, T. Mineo (INAF-IASFPA), G. Tagliaferri, P.
Romano (INAF-OAB), P. O'Brien (UL), D.N. Burrows (PSU) on behalf of the
Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed the first 5 ks of XRT data of the Swift ToO observation
of the HETE burst GRB 060121 (M. Arimoto at al. 2006, GCN 4550).
The XRT observation started on 2006-01-22 at 01:21:37 UT, 2hr 56min 42.5s
after the HETE trigger.

We find a single bright fading source at 

RA(J2000) = 09h 09m 52.13s  
Dec(J2000) = +45d 39m 44.9s

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (90% containment).  This position includes
the latest XRT boresight correction.  This position is 69 acrsecond
from the refined HETE posizion (G. Prigozhin et al. 2006, GCN 4551),
well within the HETE error box.
