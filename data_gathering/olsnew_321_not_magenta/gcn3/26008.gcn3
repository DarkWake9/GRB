J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
M. J. Moss (GWU), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report
on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 04:09:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191016A (trigger=929744).  Swift did not immediately
slew due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 30.296, +24.501 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 01m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = +24d 30' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex structure
structure with a duration of at least 200 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~-6 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:17 UT on 2019 October 16. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

This source lies within the current (Sector 17) field-of-view of TESS camera 1. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J.D. Gropp (jdg44 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
