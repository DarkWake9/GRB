The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:08:32.77 UT on 4 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220804A (trigger 681271717 / 220804089).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 159.4, Dec = 9.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 38m, +9d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 81.0 degrees.
