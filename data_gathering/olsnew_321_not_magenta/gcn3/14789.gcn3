G. Masi (Ceccano, Italy) and F. Nocentini (Frosinone, Italy) report:

On June 6.96456 2013 UT, we imaged the field around GRB 130606A (Ukwatta et al. 
(GCN 14781) remotely using the the 0.43m-f/6.8 robotic unit part of the Virtual 
Telescope robotic facility in Italy, 124 minutes after the burst.

4, 300 seconds unfiltered CCD images were coadded and show an object at the 
following coordinates (J2000.0):

R.A. = 16 37 35.13
Decl. +29 47 46.7

We also performed photometry, assuming R-mags from UCAC-4 for the stars in the 
field, getting an estimate for the magnitude of 19.6 (CR).
