M. Ehle and R. Perez Martinez report:

Quick-Look-Analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of the
GRB 050326 field based on a 3 ks exposure in the EPIC pn 
camera that started at 19:34 UT, shows the presence of a 
source within the SWIFT/XRT error circle (Markwardt et 
al. GCN Circ 3143, Cummings et al. GCN Circ 3145, Moretti 
et al. GCN Circ 3147).

XMMU J002748.8-712217 (J2000):
R.A. = 00h 27m 48.8s  Decl. = -71deg 22' 17.6''
with an estimated EPIC/pn count rate of 0.68 [counts/sec];

At this stage of reduction the position error is expected to
be less than 6''.
