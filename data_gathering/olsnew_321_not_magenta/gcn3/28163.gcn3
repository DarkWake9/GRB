The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 28 July, 2020 IceCube issued an alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134327_10548129.amon) 
reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of astrophysical origin. However, after additional offline analysis by the IceCube collaboration, the event was found to clearly not be of astrophysical origin.  

Data collected by the IceCube surface component, IceTop, strongly suggests this event was caused by a very-high-energy atmospheric cosmic ray air shower event.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
