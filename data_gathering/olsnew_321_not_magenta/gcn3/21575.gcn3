S. Eikenberry, K.Ackley, and S. Klimenko (U. Florida) report:

We have investigated archival 2MASS (28 Apr 1998) and Spitzer (12 Oct
2014) infrared observations of the field of SSS17a (Coulter et al. LVC GCN
21529). We find no evidence of a point-like source at this location. While
the presence of the host galaxy somewhat complicates sensitivity
estimates, in the case of 2MASS we have a preliminary estimate for a
3-sigma upper limit of J(Vega) ~ 17.6 +- 0.2 mag, which corresponds to
J(AB) ~ 18.5 +- 0.2 mag. This is a factor of ~2.5 fainter than the
J(AB)=17.5 mag detection of Tanvir et al. (LVC GCN 21544), indicating a
variable or transient nature for this source. More detailed analyses of
the upper limits for both 2MASS and Spitzer are forthcoming.

was changed from Singer to Eikenberry.  Singer submitted as Eikeberry's proxy,
because Eikenberry's GCN account was not yet activated.]
