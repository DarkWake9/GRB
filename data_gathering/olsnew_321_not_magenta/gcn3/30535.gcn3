GRB 210726A, detected by Swift BAT and XRT (GCN 30523) appears likely
to be a short burst, despite the real time duration estimate (~3s)
reported in the discovery circular using limited data products. The
T90 estimate derived from the full downlinked Swift/BAT event data is
less than 0.5 seconds.
Follow-up is encouraged.
