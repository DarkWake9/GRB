K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets, S. Golenetskii, and D. Frederiks, on behalf of the
Konus-Wind and Helicon GRB teams, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and Helicon observed this burst at 33860 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of ~32 ms, a 25-100 keV fluence
of ~2E-7 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 32 ms of ~6E-6 erg/cm2 s.    We
have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl=
358.067, -35.896 degrees, whose radius is 80.722 +/- 0.044 degrees.  As
the center line of this annulus passes within 0.038 degrees of
SGR1900+14, we conclude that this event originated from that source.

The Ulysses time history shows evidence of precursor activity, as well
as hints of activity following the burst, suggesting that SGR1900+14
may be entering a new active phase (see GCN 1643).
