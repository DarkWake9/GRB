We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 23.31 to 2014/11 23.54 UTC (51.53
to 57.18 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.80 hours
exposure in the r, i and z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the
SDSS DR9, we obtain the following detections:

 r = 20.60 +/- 0.03
 i = 20.44 +/- 0.03
 z = 20.06 +/- 0.29

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The afterglow appears to have rebrightened by about 0.24 magnitudes in
r and i compared to our observations at 30 hours (Butler et al., GCN
17087).

Mártir.
