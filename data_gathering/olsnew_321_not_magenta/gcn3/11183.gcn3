C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB),
N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope South automatically began observing
GRB 100902A (Sakamoto et al. GCN Circ. 11181) on September 02,
19:34:38 UT, 164 seconds from the GRB trigger time and during
the major gamma-ray spikes (GCN 11181).
Within the XRT error circle we do not find any source
down to the following limiting magnitudes:

Mid time from      Exposure    Filter   Limiting Magnitude
trigger (s)           (s)
------------------------------------------------------------
169                   10          R > 15.6
203                 3x10          R > 16.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Calibration is against some nearby USNOB-1 stars.
The relatively poor limits are due to the vicinity to the Moon.
