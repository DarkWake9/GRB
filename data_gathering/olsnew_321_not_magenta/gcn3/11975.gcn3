Dong Xu (WIS), Maohai Huang (CAS), Bing Zhang (UNLV) report on behalf
of a large collaboration:

European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory is scheduled to
make far infrared photometric observations of GRB 110422A on 30 April
around 14UT in 70ìm and 170ìm bands, and two follow-ups on 2-3 May
(time to be decided) in 70,170,250,350,500ìm bands, and on 6-7 May in
250,350,500ìm bands. This would be the first time a cosmological GRB
is observed in 70-350ìm. Other facilities are encouraged to obtain
results of GRB 110422A across the spectrum on those Herschel observing
days.
