C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-211023A
(GCN 30957), the reported position:

RA: +253.30 (+1.05 / -1.08 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -1.72 (+1.16 / -1.11 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately from 0.1 minutes
prior until 34.4 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM
observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
