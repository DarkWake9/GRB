We searched IceCube online track-like neutrino candidates (GFU) detected in
a [-500,500] second interval about the LIGO-Virgo trigger G296853. We
compared the candidate source directions of 4 temporally-coincident
neutrinos to the BAYESTAR skymap, with the following parameters:

#            dt[s]     RA[deg]    Dec[deg]      E[TeV]  Sigma[deg]
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.         -310.02        65.9        -5.2        1.11         0.5
2.         -128.45        74.0       -29.2       52.68         0.2
3.          361.60       164.0       -14.6       20.50         0.5
4.          438.49       121.1       -64.8       81.83         2.1


(dt--time from GW in [seconds]; RA/Dec--sky location in [degrees];
E--reconstructed secondary muon energy in [TeV]; Sigma--uncertainty of
direction reconstruction in [degrees])

The analysis found NO COINCIDENT ONLINE TRACK-LIKE NEUTRINO CANDIDATES
detected by IceCube within the 500 second window surrounding G296853 within
the BAYESTAR skymap.

A coincident neutrino-GW skymap has been posted to GraceDB (<

coinc_skymap_initial_icecube.png,0>). A JSON-formatted list of the above
neutrinos can be downloaded from GraceDB at: <https://gracedb.ligo.org/

In addition, we are performing coincident searches with other IceCube data
streams, including the high-energy starting events (HESE) and Supernova
triggers.  HESE events have typical energies > 60 TeV and start inside the
detector volume, leading to a relatively pure event sample with a high
fraction of astrophysical neutrinos.  The SN trigger system is sensitive to
sudden increases in photomultiplier counts across the detector, which could
indicate a burst of MeV neutrinos.  We will submit separate GCN circulars
if coincident HESE or SN triggers are found.

operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.  For a description of
