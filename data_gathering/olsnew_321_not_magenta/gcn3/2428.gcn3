M.C. Nysewander, J.A. Moran, D. Reichart (Univ. of North Carolina) & M.
Schwartz (Tenagra Observatories) on behalf of the FUN GRB collaboration
report:

        We began observations in Ic of the error box of HETE trigger 2882
(GRB 031026) at 09:30:10 UT (3.9 hrs after the burst) with the 32-inch
Tenagra II telescope.  99% of the error box was covered in four pointings,
with a total integration time of 1350s per pointing.

        Comparison to the POSS2 Red & IR images yields no candidates down
to the approximate limiting magnitude of the plates, which we estimate to
be Ic ~ 19.
