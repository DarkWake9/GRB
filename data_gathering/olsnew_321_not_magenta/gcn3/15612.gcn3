SUBJECT: GRB 131226A: Swift detection of a burst
DATE:    13/12/26 06:01:22 GMT
FROM:    Mike Siegel at PSU/Swift MOC  <siegel@swift.psu.edu>

S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL), H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA),
N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 05:47:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 131226A (trigger=582123).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 301.307, -64.962 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 05m 14s
   Dec(J2000) = -64d 57' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~15000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 2014 January 27. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (samantha.oates AT ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
