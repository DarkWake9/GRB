"At 11:04:32.93 UT on 11 July 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 200711A(trigger 616158277 / 200711461),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Marshall et al. 2020, GCN 28078).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 77
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright pulse followed by some
extended emission with a duration (T90) of about 29 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+24.58 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.04 +/- 0.03 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 287 +/- 18 keV.
A Band function fits equally well, with Epeak = 215 +/- 23 keV,
alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.05 and beta = -2.04 +/- 0.10.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.510 +/- 0.042)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+3.64 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 16.3 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
