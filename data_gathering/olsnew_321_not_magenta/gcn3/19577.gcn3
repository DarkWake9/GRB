At 22:40:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160625A (trigger=701503).  Swift did not slew to the burst due to
an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 176.937, -65.114, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 47m 45s
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 06' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several peaks in the first 
40 sec and then a large peak at T+170 sec
structure with a duration of at least 180 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~14000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~175 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+20.3
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Maselli (maselli AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
