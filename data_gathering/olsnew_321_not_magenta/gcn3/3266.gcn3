Gemma Anderson, Marilena Salvo, Josh Rich and  Brian P Schmidt 
(Australian National University) report on behalf of a larger collaboration

"We observed a 6' region covering the BAT position of  the SWIFT burst 
GRB 050416
using the ANU 2.3m telescope on April 12.51 UT in R band.  The object 
identified by Cenko and Fox is mvisible and clearly has faded in 
comparison with their image.  This indicate that this object is likely 
the afterglow of GRB 050416
