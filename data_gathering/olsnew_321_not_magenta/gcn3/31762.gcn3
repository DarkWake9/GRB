The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2022-03-17 at 02:32:17.68 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 1.899 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136441_11435033.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2022-03-17
Time:  02:32:17.68 UT
RA: 155.74 (+2.23, -1.74 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 11.19 (+1.00, -1.39 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

One gamma-ray source listed in the 4FGL-DR2 Fermi-LAT catalog is located within the 90% uncertainty region: 4FGL J1018.9+1043 (154.74 deg, 10.73 deg J2000, 1.08 deg away from the best-fit neutrino position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
