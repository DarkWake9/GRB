The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-220221A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/31618.gcn3) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2022-02-21 00:33:59.106 UTC to 2022-02-21 00:50:39.106 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event  that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-220221A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220221A is 1.4e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 9e+04 GeV.

A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2022-02-20 00:42:19.106 UTC to 2022-02-22 00:42:19.106 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 0.41, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-220221A ranges from 1.6e-01 to 1.7e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can
