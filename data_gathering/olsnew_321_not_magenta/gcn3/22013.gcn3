The AMI Large Array triggered on the Fermi-LAT alert for GRB 171010A (Omodei et al., GCN 21985) as part of the 4pisky program. Our initial observations at 15.5 GHz on 2017 Oct 12 reveal an unresolved radio source consistent with the XRT afterglow location (D'Ai et al., GCN 21989), with a flux of ~2.5 mJy. Please note that due to the large AMI beam in this case (~ 100x30 arc-second), the detected source may be contaminated by other radio sources. However, the nearest radio source detected in the NVSS archival data is 6.9 arc-minute away. Further analysis is in progress and future AMI observations are planned. We encourage further radio followup observations. 

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/ <http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/>.
