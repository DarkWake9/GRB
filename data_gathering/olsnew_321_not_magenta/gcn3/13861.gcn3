The correct   formula (1) (Yurkov et al.,GCNC 13854) is:

"The light curve between 200 sec and 6600 sec is very simmetrical in
log(F) - log (t) coordinates (like to bell) with parabolic low :

    m - m_max  = A (log t/t_max)^2     (1)


A = 4.2 +/- 0.1

where t is time from GRB trigger in sec, t_max = 633+-11s, m_max =
16.60+/-0.02 . We
stress that this formulae does not depend on redshift."
