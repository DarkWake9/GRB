K. McGowan (UCL-MSSL), A. Morgan (PSU), K. Mason (PPARC),
T. Kennedy (UCL-MSSL) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the afterglow of
GRB 050802 at 2005-08-02T10:15:14, 286 s after the
BAT trigger (Band et al., GCN 3734).  In addition to our
reported detection from the initial V filter observations
(McGowan et al., GCN 3739), we now report that we detect
the afterglow in all six filters.

We extracted data using a 6 arcsec radius aperture
centered on the source position (McGowan et al., GCN 3739)
for the optical filters, a 12 arcsec radius for the W1 and
M2 filters, and 4 arcsec for the W2 filter.  If the
significance of the source detection was less than 2 sigma
we determined a 3-sigma limiting magnitude.

The detection in UVW2 implies that the Lyman Limit must be blueward
of 2000 A, and we estimate that the burst is at redshift z < 1.2.

We obtain the following photometry of the afterglow candidate:

W2       268           1240.5      20.73+/-0.27   detection
W2       3481          25890.5     >22.64         3-sig limit

where T_mid is the midpoint of the exposure post-trigger in seconds.

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
