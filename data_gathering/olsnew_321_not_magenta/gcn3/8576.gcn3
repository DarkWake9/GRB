M. Andreev, A. Sergeev,  (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy),  A. 
Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed   the field of GRB 081128 detected by SWIFT (Margutti  et al, 
GCN 8571) with the Z-600  telescope of Mt. Terskol observatory.  A set of 
90 s unfiltered exposures was taken starting (UT) Nov. 28 17:37.  In a 
combined image of  first exposures (3x90 s) we do not detect any new 
object  in the  enhanced XRT (Evans, et al, GCN 8573) up to 18.5m. In a 
combined image 18x90 s at mid time (UT) Nov. 28 18:08 we detect a faint 
object at coordinates (J2000) RA, Dec =  01 23 13.02 +38 07 38.1 with 
brightness of ~20.3m. A photometry and astrometry is preliminary and based 
on USNO-A2.0 and R mag of USNO-A2.0. Our photometry at ~ 50 min after 
burst is consistent with the photometry reported early (Wang et al, GCN 
8572, Lin et al, GCN 8575) suggesting non fading source within XRT error 
box.
