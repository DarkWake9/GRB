report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a 
long bright burst, GRB 220104A, at 2022-01-04T04:01:02.850 UTC (denoted as T0)，
which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #31380).

According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of a broad pulse
with a duration of about 2 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): 
ra: 192.9 deg
dec: 37.3 deg
err: 10.1 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration. 

The GECAM preliminary location could be found here:
http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/gecamb_sky_fit_94968062.png

This position is consistent with the Fermi GBM team localization 
(trigger #662961667) within the error.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
