behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190602aq at T0 = 2019-06-02
17:59:27.089 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event candidate within a time interval
covering +/- 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration time at
different celestial positions within the accessible 90% c.l. localization
region (LR) of S190602aq (about 100% of the LR), from a minimum of 1.6E-06
erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 9.4E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a
single power law with photon index 1.5). The LR is exposed at off-axis
angles greater than 100 deg.

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
