Swift UVOT team.

The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observing the field of 
GRB 050326 (GCN 3143) at 10:48:16 UT. The burst was within the Earth-limb 
constraint at the time of the BAT trigger and therefore Swift did not slew to 
this burst for about another 54 minutes. We detect no source at the location of 
the X-ray position (GCN 3147) in any filter. The 5-sigma limiting magnitude for 
the first 100s exposure taken in the V-filter is V > 18.91 +/- 0.12 mag, based 
on preliminary in-orbit zero points.
