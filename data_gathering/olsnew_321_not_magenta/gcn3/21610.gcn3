Spectra of an unresolved source at coordinates RA=197.4504, DEC=-23.3815
near the galaxy NGC 4993, obtained with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on
the Southern African Large Telescope at UT 17:07:19.703 on 18 August 2017
and at UT 16:58:32.764 on 19 August 2017 during early twilight.   The
spectra extends between 3600-8000 Angstroms with a resolution of ~300.  The
spectra is heavily blended with the host galaxy.  After subtraction of the
host galaxy spectra from the 18 August, the source shows a spectra
increasing in flux from 8000 A to 5000 A, which then decreases in flux
after 4500 A.   The spectra from the 19 August 2017 was taken early
twilight and too noisy to say anything definitive.
