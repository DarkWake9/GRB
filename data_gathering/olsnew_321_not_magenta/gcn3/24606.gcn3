Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190519A (trigger #904394)
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 24595).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 114.758, -38.813 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 39m 01.9s
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 48' 46.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 8%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure that starts at
~T-60 s and ends at ~T+15 s. The main peak occurs at ~T0. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 45.58 +- 2.86 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-56.97 to T+14.79 sec is best fit by a
power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.32 +- 0.24,
and Epeak of 90.0 +- 35.0 keV (chi squared 76.36 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-5 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T-0.21 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
20.6 +- 1.7 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.72 +- 0.06 (chi squared 85.04 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
