 (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) report:

 The field of GRB 090408 (Stroh et al. GCN 9110) was observed
with the 150 cm telescope of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Starting at 16:03 UT and 18.36 UT (1.03 and 2.58 hours after the
trigger), Rc and Ic frames were acquired for sets of 5 x 3-min
and 5 x 3-min exposures under a hazy sky condition.

  We did not detect any new point source within the BAT error circle
to limiting magnitudes below relative to USNO-B1.0 R2 and I magnitudes.
