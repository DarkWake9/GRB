G. Stratta (ASDC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 20:45:47 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071010B (trigger=293795). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 150.530, +45.731 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 02m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 43' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single FRED pulse
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~12,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations,
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled outside of
business hours (US EDT).  Therefore, there
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. B. Markwardt (craigm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
