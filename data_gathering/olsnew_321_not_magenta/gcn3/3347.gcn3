J. S. Bloom (UCB) and J. X. Prochaska (UCSC):

"In observing the field of Integral trigger 2486 with the PAIRITEL 1.3m we
note a bright source near the center of the localization error circular.
This source, at 13:24:03.027 +40:41:47 (J2000), is BD+41 2391 (=SAO
44596), is listed in the 2MASS catalogue with J=7.249, H=6.480 and
Ks=6.289 mag and is of spectral type K2. Aside from the spatial
coincidence, we have no other evidence connecting this source with the
Integral trigger."
