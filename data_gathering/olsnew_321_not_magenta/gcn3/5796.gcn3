TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  5796
SUBJECT: GRB 061110: ROTSE-III Optical Limits

B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), F. Yuan (U Mich), 
W. Rujopakarn (U Arizona), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIa, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, responded to 
GRB 061110A (Swift trigger 238108), producing images beginning 8.8 s after 
the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image at 
11:48:04.9 UT, 43.6 s after the burst, under fair conditions. We took 10 
5-sec, 10 20-sec and 10 60-sec eposures. These unfiltered images are 
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma BAT error circle and also within the XRT error circle, for both
single images and coadding into sets of 10;  the field is not crowded.
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 14.3-17.1; we set
the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
