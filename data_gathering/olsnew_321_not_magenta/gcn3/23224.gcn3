We have performed a search of hard X-ray/gamma-ray counterpart
to the IceCube neutrino event IceCube-180908A (The IceCube Collaboration,
GCN Circ. 23214) in the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data
around the event time at T0=19:59:31.84 UT on 2018 September 8.
The event position (RA, Dec (J2000) = 144.58 [-1.45,+1.55] deg,
-2.13 [-1.2,+0.9] deg) at that time was in the CGBM FOV at
favorable angles (the off-axis angles 19 deg and 16 deg for HXM
and SGM detector respectively).

No CGBM on-board trigger occurred around T0 (the nearest GRB triggered
CGBM at 20:28:41.478 UTC on 9 August 2018: Cherry et al., GCN 23116;
all subsequent CGBM triggers were due to local particles).
By using the CGBM time-history data (0.125 sec time resolution),
we found no statistically significant signal within T0 +- 800 sec interval
in either the HXM (7-3000 keV) or the SGM (40 keV - 28 MeV) data.
We estimate 7-sigma upper limit in the 40-1000 keV band as
6.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2/s assuming a simple power-law model with
a photon index of -2 and 7.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2/s assuming a GRB (Band) model
with the typical parameters for long GRBs: alpha = -1.0, Ep = 300 keV,
and beta = -2.5 (both in 1 sec exposure).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
