(U. Leicester), M.G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), E. Ambrosi	(INAF-IASFPA) ,
M. Capalbi (INAF-IASFPA), B. Sbarufatti (PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.
D. Gropp (PSU) and S. Laha report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.8 ks of XRT data for GRB 210419A (Laha et al. GCN
Circ. 29828), from 134 s to 64.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 143 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 29830).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.5 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.0 (+/-0.3).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.71 (+0.11, -0.10). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.4 (+0.4, -0.3) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 7.8 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.60 (+0.29, -0.27)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.9 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 2.6 x 10^-11 (4.8 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.9 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 7.8 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.9 sigma
Photon index:	     2.60 (+0.29, -0.27)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.0, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 4.3 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.1 x
10^-13 (2.1 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
