J. S. Bloom and W. Li (UC Berkeley) report:

The correct position from GCN 4465 should be (J2000)

04:50:57.9
  +28:25:49

We thank P. Milne for pointing out the 10 hour error in RA.

We further report that a check of Minor Planets (1) in the vicinity  
of GRB 060110 shows no known bright (V < 19) sources in the field at  
the time of the IR observations.

A comparison of the JHK imaging with the DSS is now posted (2).
