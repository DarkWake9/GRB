MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru)
located in Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB130907A 18 sec  after notice
time and 43 sec after GRB time at 2013-09-07  21:42:00 UT in two
polarizations. The observations were performed at low elevation (zenith 
angle 84 deg)and under the changing transparency conditions. The OT (Page et. al. 
GCN15183) appears on the 4th image in the series and is visible on four 
consecutive  images (20, 30, 40 and 50 sec exposures) in both tubes with 
the signal-to-noise ratio from 3 to 6. Starting with T0+5 min, the image 
quality was further deteriorating with the OT visible only on the sum of 
two pairs of synchronous images.

Our photometry results are presented in Table 1.

*) All time intervals in seconds.  P| and P- is an unfiltered magnitude 
with RA and DEC orientated polaroid correspondingly.
The sign '<'  before magnitude means the value is upper limit.

The epoch of our observations completely covers Swift BAT weak, soft peak 
from T+210 sec to T+240 sec (Cummings et. al. GCN15202).

Our first automatic and not so exact (due to difficult observing 
conditions) estimation of the  OT magnitude, given in the previous 
telegram (Gorbovskoy et. al GCN15184),  belongs to  epoch of the 5th 
exposure with t_mid=217 sec. after the trigger. This fact isn't clear from 
the telegram  text that could mislead some researchers.
We apologize for this inaccuracy.
