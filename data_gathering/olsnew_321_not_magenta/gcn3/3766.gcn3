The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=149118) at 18:04:00 UT on 05 Aug 2005
is not likely to be due to a GRB.  Although we detect an unknown source
in the BAT FOV at RA,Dec=331.154,+29.902 (J2000, 3 arcmin, radius, 90%,
sys+stat), we can not confirm that it is a GRB.  And given that we have
just come out of the gap in the data downlink passes and that there was
a prior backlog of data to download, we will not have access to the
full data set on this trigger for about 8 hours.

At 18:06:00 UT XRT attempted to centroid on the BAT position, 120 secs 
after the BAT trigger.  While the initial TRDSS lightcurve shows
a marginal spike in the count rate, the instrument drops immediately into 
Photon-Counting mode with a very low count rate for the next 100 sec.
Because of the low count rate, no position was acquired by the
on-board software.  We await ground analysis of the early XRT data
following the first Malindi pass.
