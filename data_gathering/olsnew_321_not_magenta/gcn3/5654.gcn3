At 19:55:01UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060929 (trigger=231702).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The on-board location (obtained from a Lightcurve SERS message) is RA,Dec (J2000)
263.164,+29.815 {17h32m39s, 29d48m54s}.  Because of a telemetry gap covering the 
first ~50 sec of the TDRSS messages, we can say nothing about the lightcurve until 
the full data set is downlinked. 

The XRT began taking data at 19:56:33 UT, 92 seconds after the BAT trigger.  
The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in the image, 
however analysis of prompt downlinked data reveals a faint, uncatalogued 
point source at the following location:
  RA(J2000) =  17h 32m 29.0s
 Dec(J2000) = +29d 50m 08.5s
with an estimated uncertainty of 7.3 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This source lies 154 arcseconds from the BAT position. 

At this time due to the telemetry gap, only a raw UVOT finding chart image (no sky 
coordinates) obtained with the white light filter is available. We have attempted 
to perform pattern matching with the DSS and no obvious afterglow candidate is 
seen.
