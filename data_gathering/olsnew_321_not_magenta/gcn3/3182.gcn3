The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began settled 
observations of the field of GRB 050406 (Parsons et al; GCN 3180) at 
16:00:16 UT, 88s after the BAT trigger.  The first data taken after 
spacecraft settling was a 100s V image with pixel size 0.5x0.5 arcsec 
and a field of view of 17x17 arcmin. Mid-exposure time was 138s after 
the trigger. A comparison against the Digitized Sky Survey reveals no 
new sources in the field down to a 3-sigma background limit of V = 
18.8. This limit is based upon preliminary flight calibrations.
