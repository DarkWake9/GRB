K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and
S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed this burst at 85773 s.  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration ~25 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
area is approximately 35 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are
