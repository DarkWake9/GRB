report:
     
We have imaged in J, H and Ks bands with VLT/NACO the field of SGR
1806-20 on March 9th, 10th, 16th and 17th 2004. Observations were
activated after the X-ray burst that occurred on March 9th (Mereghetti
et al., GCN 2541). We have detected several sources within the Chandra
error circle reported in Eikenberry et al. 2001 (ApJ 563, L133)
including those reported in GCN 2607 (Kouveliotou et al.). 
         
The monitoring of these objects did not show any variability more
significant than 2sigma in the Ks band on time scales from hours up to
days. The limiting Ks magnitude was about 21.5.
         
Both the lack of IR variability correlated to the X-ray burst activity
and the relatively high IR flux for the proposed counterparts (GCN 2607)
suggest that these objects are unlikely the IR counterpart to SGR
1806-20.
