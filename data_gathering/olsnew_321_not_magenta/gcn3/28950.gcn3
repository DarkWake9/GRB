The AMON,  IceCube and HAWC collaborations report:

The AMON NuEm stream channel found a coincidence alert from the
IceCube online neutrino selection + HAWC daily monitoring analysis.
The analysis looks for IceCube neutrino events -mostly atmospheric
in origin- around the position and transit time of a HAWC cluster of
likely gamma rays, as identified in the integrated observations from
a single transit, in this case having a duration of 5.99 hours.

The HAWC transit interval is  from 11, 24, 2020 08:14:10 UT to
11 24, 2020, at 14:13:37 UT
(End of the HAWC transit time)
The location of the coincidence is reported as
RA (J2000): 134.99 deg
Dec (J2000): 7.74 deg
Location uncertainty (50% containment): 0.23 deg (statistical only).
Location uncertainty (90% containment): 0.42 deg (statistical only).

The false alarm rate (FAR) of this coincidence is 2.96 per year.
We encourage follow-up observations of the alert region contingent on
availability of resources and interest, given the quoted FAR.

AMON seeks to perform a real-time correlation analysis of the
high-energy signals across all known astronomical messengers. More
