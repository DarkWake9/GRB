A. Moskvitin (SAO RAS) report:

We observed the GRB160310A field 17h 57m 26s after the trigger (Fermi
trigger number 479262182) in R-band with a total exposure of 13 x 120 s.
We detected a source brighter than in SDSS images at
RA = 06:35:14.4
Dec = -07:03:49.0
with the R magnitude 20.34. The magnitude is not corrected
for the Galactic extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.53
in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
The photometry is based on USNO-b1 stars.
