GRB team report:

A SGR-like burst 050811 triggered Konus-Wind
at 48952.617 s UT (13:35:52.617).
It was also detected by Integral SPI-ACS.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 301.581 deg, Decl(2000) = -17.751 deg,
whose radius is 28.122 +/- 1.686 deg (3 sigma).
As the center line of this annulus passes 0.23 degrees (0.41 sigma)
from the position of SGR 1806-20
and the Konus ecliptic latitude response indicates
that the source of the burst is near ecliptic plane,
we conclude that this burst originated from SGR 1806-20.

The burst had a duration of ~2.3 sec,
fluence (1.70+/- 0.17)10-5 erg/cm2,
and peak flux on 48-ms time scale (1.8 +/- 0.1)10-5 erg/cm2 s
(both in 20-200 keV range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst is well fitted by the OTTB
spectral model:
dN/dE ~ E^{-1} exp(-E/kT),
with kT = 18.2 +/- 0.6 keV.
