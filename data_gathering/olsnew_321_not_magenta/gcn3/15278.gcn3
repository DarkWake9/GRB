Eight IPN spacecraft observed GRB 130925A (Lien et al. GCN 15246,
Markwardt et al. 15247).  When the responses of all the spacecraft are
considered, the IPN had an uninterrupted view of this event from
roughly 900 s before the Swift BAT trigger, to ~7100 s after it.
Constraints on the arrival directions of the four main emission
episodes strengthen the case for their common origin, as suggested by
Savchenko et al. (GCN 15259).  The following table details the
observations.  The times are relative to the BAT trigger at 15084 s UT
(04:11:24).  N/O means the episode was not observable.

*also observed and localized by MAXI (Suzuki et al. GCN 15248)

We conclude from these observations that the total duration of this
event in >25 keV gamma-rays above the IPN flux/fluence threshold was 
at least 5260 s, and ~7150 s long when the later episodes, observed only
by BAT (GCN 15257), are included.
