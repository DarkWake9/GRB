W. Li and J. Bloom (University of California, Berkeley), on behalf
of the KAIT GRB team, report:

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 060906, detected with Swift
(Trigger 228316; Racusin et al. GCN 5528). The automatic sequence
started at 08:34:32, 106 s after the burst. In a 15 s unfiltered 
image, no afterglow candidate is detected to a limiting magnitude
of 18.2 (from comparison with the USNO B1.0 catalog). We detected
the optical afterglow reported by Cenko et al. (GCN 5529, 5531)
in a 45 s unfiltered image started at 336 s after the burst, with
the following precise (+/- 0.2") position:

RA = 2:43:00.84   Dec = +39:21:41.9 (J2000.)

A table of photometry (3-sigma limits and detections) is reported
below.
