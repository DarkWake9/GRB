report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

GRB 111022A: Swift/UVOT Non-Detection

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the white filter
starting 815 seconds after the BAT trigger.  This field is very crowded,
but no credible afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data
products.  The 2.7' x 2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle.
The estimated 3-sigma upper limit is white > 20.0 mag.  No correction has
been made for the expected Galactic extinction corresponding to a reddening
of E_{B-V} =  0.66 mag.  Due to the low Galactic latitude of this burst the
extinction is highly uncertain.
