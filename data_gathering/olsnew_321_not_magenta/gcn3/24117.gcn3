report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-04-11T09:45:46.000 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190411A (trigger ID: HEB190411406) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (trigger number 576668753);

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 34.10 s measured from T0+2.32 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+4.50 s, is 19416 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 110320 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
