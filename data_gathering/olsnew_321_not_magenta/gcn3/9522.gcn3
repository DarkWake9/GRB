   We observed GRB090618 (Schady et al. GCN 9512) in R using
  the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) operated by
  the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute.
   The observation started about 50min after the BAT trigger.

   The first image taken with the mid-point at June 18,
  09:52 UT (53m42s after the BAT trigger) shows a clear detection
  of the afterglow at R=15.9 +- 0.1 mag, reported earlier by a number of
  groups (GCN 9513, 9514, 9515, 9520).
   The photometry was calibrated against R1mag of USNO-B1 stars
  in the vicinity of GRB.
   More data were taken, and they are being analyzed.

   We thank the LOAO operator, Y. Baek for her assistance of this
  observation.
