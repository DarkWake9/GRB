D. M. Palmer (LANL) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 01:25:25 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160220A (trigger=674670).  Swift could not immediately
slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 236.925, -18.555 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 47m 42s
   Dec(J2000) = -18d 33' 17"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.1
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
