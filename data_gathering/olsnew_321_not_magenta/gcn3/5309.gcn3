S. B. Cenko and E. O. Ofek (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060712 (Cummings et al; GCN 5301) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of 5 x 180 s
exposures in the Kron R and Sloan i' filters taken at a mean epoch of
approximately UT July 13.22 (~ 8.3 hours after the burst).  Inside the
revised XRT error circle (Vetere et al; GCN 5305), we find no evidence
for any sources.  The limiting magnitude of our observation is R < 20.5.
