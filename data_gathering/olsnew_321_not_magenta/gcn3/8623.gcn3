Guy Pooley (MRAO/Cavendish Astrophysics, University of Cambridge) reports:

We used the AMI large array (the rebuilt/upgraded Ryle Telescope)
in the band 14 - 17 GHz to observe the field of the optically 
bright GRB 081203A (GCN 8595). There was no detection of the afterglow on 
either of two observations. The measured flux densities at the optical 
position are:

2008 Nov 04.26   116 +- 300 microJy
2008 Nov 05.24    80 +- 200 microJy 

(cf Chandra & Frail, GCN 8613, for an upper limit at 8.46 GHz)
