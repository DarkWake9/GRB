K. Kinugasa (Gunma Astronomical Observatory)  report:

 The field of GRB 080229A (Cannizzo et al. GCN 7335) was observed
with the 150 cm telescope of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Starting at 18:19 UT (1.25 hours after the burst), Rc, and Ic frames
were acquired for 5 x 3-min exposures  under a poor seeing (~3.5arcsec)
condition.

 The enhaunced XRT position (Beardmore et al. GCN 7343) is close to 
a bright star, so the field are strongly contaminated  with the light 
from this star. We do not identify the optical counterpart reported
by Yoshida et al. (GCN 7341) to 3-sigma limiting magnitudes of Rc=19.3
and Ic=18.7 relative to USNO-B1.0 magnitudes.
