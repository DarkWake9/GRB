S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), M. M. Chester (PSU),
J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), J. A. Kennea (PSU), V. Mangano (PSU) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 02:58:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on a noise
fluctuation on the rising background while entering the SAA. 

The XRT began observing the field at 03:00:00.6 UT, 89.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger and centroided on a cosmic ray hit. 

Because this is a marginal significance BAT image peak, as Swift was 
entering the SAA, and there is no corresponding source at the correct 
location in XRT, we believe that this is not an astrophysical source.
