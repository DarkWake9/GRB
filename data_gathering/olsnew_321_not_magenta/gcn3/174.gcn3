TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  174
SUBJECT: GRB981226, BeppoSAX Christmas GRB
DATE:    98/12/28 05:03:57 GMT
FROM:    Luigi Piro at IAS/CNR Frascati  <piro@alpha1.ias.rm.cnr.it>

L. Piro and the BeppoSAX team report:


A GRB (GB981226) was detected by the GRBM and WFC of BeppoSAX on Dec.26,
around 9:47 U.T. 

Preliminary coordinates from WFC are:
R.A.(2000)=352.433
DEC(2000)=-23.942

The error radius is about 8', including a systematic error due a 
less-than-optimal attitude configuration.

A follow-on with NFI is being planned.



[GCN OP NOTE:  This Circular was received 26 Dec 1998 15:00 UT.  However,
it was not sent to the automated system, and I was away on holiday without any
computer access to catch it sitting in my inbox.  I am distributing it
for the record even though most of the community knows of this burst, and
several have made follow-up observations: GCN Circulars 169, 172, and 173.
I will attempt to correct such shortcomings plus the GCN Notice format problem
for future events.]
