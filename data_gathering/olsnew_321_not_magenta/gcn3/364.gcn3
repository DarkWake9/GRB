A BeppoSAX follow-up of GRB990704 started about 8 hr after the burst.
Preliminary analysis of the first three orbits of the MECS data at SOC
shows a previously unknown source inside the WFC error circle.

Preliminary coordinates  are:

DEC(2000)= -3.840

The error radius is 1.7'.

BeppoSAX is continuing its observation.
