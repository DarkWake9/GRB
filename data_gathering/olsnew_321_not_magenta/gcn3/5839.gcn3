Burrows (PSU),  F. Marshall (GSFC), P. Roming (PSU), T. Sakamoto 
(GSFC), G. Sato (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

The Swift team declares GRB 061121 to be a "burst of interest".  It 
is bright in BAT, XRT and UVOT.  It was observed by Konus-Wind, 
RHESSI, XRT, UVOT and ground-based optical telescope observations 
during the prompt phase, giving broad-band coverage of the 
burst.  The Epeak and redshift have been determined.  The X-ray 
afterglow has been observed by XMM.  Swift will continue intensive 
observations of the afterglow as long as it is detectable.  We 
encourage multiwavelength observations of the burst throughout its lightcurve.

Swift observations of GRB 061121 are discussed in GCN Report 15.1 
(http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/reports/report_15_1.pdf).
