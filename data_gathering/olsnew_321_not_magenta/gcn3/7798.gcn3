Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080516 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 311762) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 64.6s after the GRB trigger
(49.9s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased
from 48 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were excellents.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-05-16T00:17:07.296

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect the OT noticed by Filgas et al.
(GCNC 7740) with a limiting magnitude of:

t0+64.6s to t0+124.6s : R > 13.5
(the poor detectivity is due to the 10 magnitude
close star).

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:

t0+131.0s to t0+161.0s : R > 15
(we substracted an image taken at t0+20 min to
minimize the effect of the 10 magnitude close star).

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=244.1279 lat= +2.4429
and the galactic extinction in R band is 1.1 magnitude
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
