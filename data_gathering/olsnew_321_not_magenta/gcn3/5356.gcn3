P. Goldoni report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

The 60cm robotic telescope REM (La Silla) observed automatically
the field of GRB060719 starting observations on July 19.2858,
i.e. 42 s after receiving the alert and 64 s after the BAT trigger
(Stamatikos et al. GCN 5339), and continued to observe the field
until July 19.350 UT. Preliminary results on the early observation
have been already reported in GCN 5343.

All frames acquired in the J and H filters were summed to obtain final
images in each filter for a total exposure time of 900s and 1200s
respectively. We do not detect the infrared afterglow candidate proposed
by Malesani et al. (GCN 5354). We derived the 3-sigma upper limits of
J >18.2 and H >17.8, obtained on the first 450s images.
