Klotz A. (CESR-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC),
Boer M. (OHP-OAMP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 111209A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 509336) with the TAROT robotic
telescope (D=25cm) located at the European Southern
Observatory, La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 358s after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from
13 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detected the candidate couterpart mentioned
by Hoversten et al. (GCNC 12632)
at the following position (+/- 1 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 00h 57m 22.7s
DEC(J2000.0) -46d 48' 05"

OT peaked at R~16.2 about 680s after GRB.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
