 (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) report:

 The field of GRB 090410 (Grupe et al. GCN 9122) was observed
with the 150 cm telescope of the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Starting at 18:33 UT (1.60 hours after the trigger), Rc and Ic frames
were acquired for 3 x 3-min and 5 x 3-min exposures under a high airmass
(sec z ~3) condition.

  We did not detect any new point source within the ground-calculated
BAT error circle (Barthelmy et al. GCN 9123) to limiting magnitudes
of Rc=19.0 and Ic=19.0 relative to USNO-B1.0 R2 and I magnitudes at the
meantime of 18:41 UT and 18:56 UT, respectively.
