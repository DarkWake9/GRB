A. Moskvitin on behalf of the larger GRB follow-up team report.

We observed the field of the GRB 200412B (The Fermi GBM team,
GCN 27547; Longo et al. GCN 27557) with the 1-m telescope
of SAO RAS, equipped with the Multi-Mode Photometer-Polarimeter.
We obtained 6 x 300 sec. images in Rc band on 2020.04.14
00:09:20--00:41:40 UT, T_mid - T0 = 1.6367 days.

The OT (Lipunov et al., GCNs 27555, 27556; Kumar et al., GCN
27564; Belkin et al., GCN 27566) is clearly visible in individual
images and stacked frame with the brightness of R = 20.8 +/- 0.1.
The photometry is based on R2 magnitudes of nearby USNO-B1 stars.
