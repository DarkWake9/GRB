K. D. Alexander (Harvard), T. Laskar (NRAO / UC Berkeley), and E. Berger
(Harvard) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Swift GRB 161219B (Dâ€™Ai et al. GCN 20296) at multiple
frequencies with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning 2016
December 20.26 UT (11.4 hours after the burst). At a mean frequency of
14.75 GHz, we detect a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.9
mJy at

RA (J2000) = 06:06:51.428 +/- 0.001
Dec (J2000) = -26:47:29.52 +/- 0.01

consistent with the position of the optical afterglow and the refined
Swift/XRT position (Beardmore et al. GCN 20297). Follow-up observations are
planned.

We thank the VLA staff for rapidly executing these observations.
