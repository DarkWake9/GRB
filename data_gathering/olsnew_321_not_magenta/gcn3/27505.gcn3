A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,
report:

The short-duration GRB 200405B (DeLaunay et al., GCN Circ. 27497)
was detected by Swift (BAT), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind,
at about 14018 s UT (03:53:38).
The burst was found in ground analysis of Swift (BAT) data
with low partial coding.

We have triangulated it to INTEGRAL-Konus annulus centered at
RA(2000)=354.104 deg (23h 36m 25s) Dec(2000)=-6.682 deg (-6d 40' 55"),
whose radius is 71.411 +/- 18.656 deg (3 sigma) and
to a BAT-INTEGRAL annulus centered at
RA(2000)=59.460 deg (03h 57m 50s) Dec(2000)=-50.201 deg (-50d 12' 02"),
whose radius is 8.804(-8.804,+15.572) deg (3 sigma).
These annuli intersect to form a very large region
with an area of ~1600 sq. deg.

The Swift-BAT position reported in DeLaunay et al.
is consistent with the IPN localization.

The Swift (BAT) event data used for the IPN localization
came from the GUANO system (https://www.swift.psu.edu/guano/).
