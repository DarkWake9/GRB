FROM:    Youdong HU at IAA-CSIC  <youdong@iaa.es>

Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), I. 
Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), M. D. 
Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ) and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a 
larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 200612A (Sonbas et al. 
GCNC 27915). The first image (clear filter) was obtained starting at 
09:51:32 UT(~ 5.2 hr after trigger). In the co-added image (20 exposures 
60s each), no source is found at the position reported by Swift/XRT 
(Sonbas et al. GCNC 27915) and MASTER-Net (Lipunov et al. GCNC 27917) 
down to 20.3 mag.

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
