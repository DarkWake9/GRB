Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121102A (trigger #537266)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 13938).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 270.896, -16.951 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 03m 35.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -16d 57' 03.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FED peak starting at ~T-0.2 sec,
peaking at ~T+6 sec, and ending at ~T+95 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
24.7 +- 3.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.30 to T+35.25 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.88 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.9 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+5.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
