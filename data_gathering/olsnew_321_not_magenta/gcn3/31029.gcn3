The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:06:03 UT on 2 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211102A (trigger 657533168.218864 / 211102338).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 30.8, Dec = 56.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 03m, 56d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 17.0 degrees.
