P. S. Marrocchesi (U of Siena) and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) was operating at the trigger time 
of G211117 (GCN Circ. 18728).  No CGBM on-board trigger occurred at the time 
of the event.  Based on the updated LIGO sky map (GCN Circ. 18858), 
the southern arc of the high probability area was in the field-of-view of CGBM.  

Based on the analysis of the light curve data with 0.125 sec time resolution 
from -60 sec to 60 sec from the trigger time, we found no significant excess 
around the trigger time in either the HXM (7-1000 keV) or the SGM (0.1-20 MeV) 
data.
