The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 22:00:08 UT on 16 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190716A (trigger 585007213.119332 / 190716917).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 345.6, Dec = -0.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 02m, 0d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
