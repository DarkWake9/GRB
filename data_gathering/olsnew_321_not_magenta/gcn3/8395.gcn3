Swift Team:

At 14:23:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081022 (trigger=332399). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 226.619, +12.416 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 06m 28s
   Dec(J2000) = +12d 24' 58"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This was an image trigger in BAT, but the 
light curve shows a long, smooth, 100 second wide peak with a maximum 
of ~500 cts/sec at T+50 seconds. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is G. Stratta (giulia.stratta AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
