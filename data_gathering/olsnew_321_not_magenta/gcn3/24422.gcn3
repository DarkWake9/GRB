The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:16:29 UT on 7 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190507B (trigger 578963794.637806 / 190507970).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 287.8, Dec = -22.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 11m, 22d -49'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75.0 degrees.
