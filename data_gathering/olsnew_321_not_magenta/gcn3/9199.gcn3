Brajesh Kumar, Rupak Roy, Brijesh Kumar and S. B. Pandey (ARIES,
NainiTal, India, on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

We have imaged the field of swift GRB 090418A (GCN 9149) with the 104
cm Sampurnanand Optical telescope at ARIES Nainital on 18th April 2009
at 19.815 hrs UT.
We do not detect any afterglow candidate in our co-added R_c and I_c
band images (exp time 1400sec in each band) within the error circle of
XRT (GCN 9163).
The Photometry of the co-added frames put a 3 sigma upper limit of R ~
20.64 and I ~ 19.65 mag in comparison to the nearby USNO - B1 stars.
