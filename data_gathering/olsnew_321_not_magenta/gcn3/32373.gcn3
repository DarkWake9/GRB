D. Svinkin, D. Frederiks, A. Ridnaia, A. Lysenko,
and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

E. Bozzo and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, D. Palmer, and A. Tohuvavohu
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 220711C
was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 679248723),
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT)
at about 58318 s UT (16:11:58).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg  Dec(2000), deg
   ------------------------------
   Center:
    79.625         -47.309
   Corners:
    64.292         -35.777
    64.270         -36.123
    94.188         -53.124
    93.862         -52.805
   ------------------------------
The error box area is 5.5 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 27 deg (the minimum one is 12 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 72 deg.

This box may be improved.

The IPN localization is consistent with, but reduces the area of, the
Fermi-GBM final localization (glg_healpix_all_bn220711675_v00).

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
