The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 20/11/15 IceCube issued an alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134701_49508272.amon) 
reporting the detection of an event with a high chance of being of astrophysical origin. Upon further examination by the IceCube collaboration, the event 
was found to likely not be of astrophysical origin.  

Data quality checks using the IceTop surface array indicate this event is likely due to a very high energy cosmic ray interaction and not a high energy astrophysical neutrino.  

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
