S. Covino, D. FUgazza, V. D'Elia report on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of GRB 130816A (Holland et al., GCN 15097) simultaneously in the optical and near-infrared with the the 60-cm robotic telescope REM at La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started at 01:47:56 UT, about 1 min after the GRB.

We detect a faint source compatible with the XRT position and not present in the 2MASS catalogue with coordinates:

RA (J2000) = 13:08:33.80
DEC (J2000) = -58:56:41.2

with an estimated uncertainty of +- 0.5 arcsec.
Preliminary photometry indicates that the sources was at H = 15.0 +- 0.20 (Vega) about 100 s after the burst. 

Further observations are in progress to assess its variability.
