At 17:53:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071101 (trigger=295779).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 48.194, +62.473 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 12m 46s
   Dec(J2000) = +62d 28' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 3 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 17:58:29 UT, 283 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source in the
image and no prompt position is available.  We are waiting for down-linked
data to detect and determine a position for the source. 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 82 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the large, but uncertain extinction expected. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. McBreen (smcbreen AT mpe.mpg.de). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
