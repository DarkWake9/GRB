TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1684
SUBJECT: GRB 021112: R-band search
DATE:    02/11/12 21:50:55 GMT
FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <anl@star.le.ac.uk>

A.J. Levan (Leicester), J.J. Kavelaars (HIA/NRC) and J.E Rhoads (STScI)
report for a larger collaboration.

The error box of GRB 021112 (GCN 1682) was imaged with the KPNO-4m using
the Mosaic imager beginning on November 12th 06:43 UT (3.25 hours after
burst).  Four R-band images were obtained dithered to cover the entire
HETE-2 error circle.  Most of the area was covered by all four
exposures, yielding a net total exposure time of 1680s.

Visual comparison of the stacked image with the DSS-2 (R-band) reveals
no obvious new sources.

Further observations are planned.
