The long-duration GRB 150530A (Swift-BAT trigger #642018:
Starling  et al., GCN 17888; Markwardt et al., GCN 17890;
Fermi GBM detection: Yu, Younes and Meegan, GCN 17891)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=42136.529 s UT (11:42:16.529).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse lasting from  ~T0-4 s to ~T0+6 s.
The emission is seen up to ~1.2 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.54(-0.26,+0.28)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0+0.082 s,
of 1.06(-0.43,+0.43)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1.2 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.63(-0.38,+0.46),
and Ep = 114(-17,+23) keV (chi2 = 59/58 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index:
beta < -3.07 (chi2 = 59/57 dof).
