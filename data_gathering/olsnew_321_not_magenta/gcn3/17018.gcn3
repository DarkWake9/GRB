We observed the field of GRB 141031B (Gompertz, et al., GCN 16998) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 1.10 to 2014/11 1.11 UTC (11.34 to
11.75 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36 hours
exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

For a source within the enhanced Swift-XRT error circle (Goad, et al., GCN
17009), in comparison with the SDSS DR9, we obtain the following upper
limits (3-sigma):

  r > 22.98
  i > 22.81
  z > 19.91

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
