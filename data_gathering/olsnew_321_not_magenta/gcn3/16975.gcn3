GBM team, report:

GRB 141028A (Bissaldi et al. GCN 16969, Roberts et al. GCN 16971) has
also been observed by MESSENGER, so far.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary,
3 sigma annulus, centered at RA, Dec = 16.520, +5.123 degrees, with radius
R=54.469 +/- 0.200 degrees.  This annulus intersects the LAT error circle
at two points:

	RA		Dec
     322.487 deg	-0.619 deg
     322.416 deg        +0.002 deg

forming an error box whose area is approximately 0.03 degrees.
This triangulation may be improved.
