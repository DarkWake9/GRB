report on behalf of GRAWITA: 


We observed the targets listed below, within the updated 90% probability region of S190814bv 
(LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25333), with the 3.6m Italian TNG 
telescope (Canary Islands, Spain), equipped with the NICS infrared camera in imaging mode.

desgw-190814c / AT2019nqq 01:23:49.22 -33:02:05.0
DG19qabkc / AT2019nqc 01:29:03.67 -32:42:18.5


Observations were carried out on 2019 Aug 19 between 03:32 and 04:31 UT.

These targets were reported as possible candidate counterparts of S190814bv (Andreoni et al., GCN Circ. 25362; 
Herner et al., GCN Circ. 25373; Dichiara et al., GCN Circ 25374; Tucker et al., GCN Circ. 25379; 
Goldstein et al., GCN Circ. 25391).

We observed the two targets with the J filter, with an exposure of 20 minutes per target.

With aperture photometry we measure for the source desgw-190814c / AT2019nqq a magnitude J= 20.0 +/- 0.2 (AB). 
We note that such a value can suffer from contamination from the host galaxy light.  
The source DG19qabkc / AT2019nqc is not detected down to a 3sigma limiting magnitude of J ~ 20.6 (AB). 

The photometry is calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue.
