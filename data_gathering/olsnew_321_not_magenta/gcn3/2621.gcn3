 report:
 
 "We have imaged the entire XRF 040701 error box provided 
 by HETE-2 (Barraud et al. GCN #2620) with the 0.6-m 
 telescope (+ MOA camera) at Mt.John Observatory starting 
 on July 4.459 UT. Observations were performed with the MOA 
 broad R-band filter with individual exposure times of 300 s. 
 Visual comparison of the stacked first three images with 
 the DSS-2 red plate revealed no optical counterpart
 candidate brighter than R~20.2."
