C.A. Alvarez Iglesias (IAC-ULL) report:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale et al. GCN
14377) with the 10.4m GTC telescope starting at 21:45 UT (2.75 hr after the
burst). Observations consisted of 2x600s using the R1000B grating, with a 
resolution of R~1000 in the range 3600 - 7900 A.

The spectrum shows a high S/N trace, with very weak MgII features at a 
redshift of z = 1.218, which we identify as the redshift of the GRB.
