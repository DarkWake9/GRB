At 11:42:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB050701(trigger=143708).   The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA,Dec 227.287d  -59.419d
{+15h 09m 09s, -59d 25' 06"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 3-sigma, including estimated systematic uncertainty).  The
detection significance in the image plane is 14.2 sigma.
The BAT light curve showed a complex multipeaked structure
with a duration of about 40 seconds.  The peak
count rate of 5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV) was measured by
BAT in the 1-sec time interval centered on T+15 sec after the trigger.

Because this burst was 40 arcminutes from a known source
(PSR 1509-58) it was incorrectly classified on-board
and so Swift did not automatically slew to observe this burst.
A target of opportunity observation is being planned.
