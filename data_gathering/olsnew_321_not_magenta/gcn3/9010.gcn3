team, report:

The long GRB 090315 localized by IPN (Hurley et al., GCN
9009) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=15180.047 s UT (04:13:00.047).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.10(-0.30, +0.32)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+5.920 s
of 5.56(-1.33, +1.38)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+14.080 s) can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 5 MeV
range) by GRB (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.55(-0.15, +0.19),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.62(-0.91, 0.34),
the peak energy Ep = 247 +/- 33 keV (chi2 = 84.8/73 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
