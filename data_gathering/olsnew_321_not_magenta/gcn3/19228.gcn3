L. M. McCauley (PSU) and E. Sonbas (Adiyaman Univ.) report on behalf of
the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 74 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =        01:02:36.28 =  15.65118
  DEC(J2000) = -72:41:46.8  = -72.69634
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc sec. This position is
5.35
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle and consistent with the
position
 reported by Fugazza et al. (GCN Circ. 19223).

Preliminary detections and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric
system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures
are:

Filter         T_start(s)   T_stop(s)      Exp(s)           Mag

white_fc              74          160          86           15.48+-0.03

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.04 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
