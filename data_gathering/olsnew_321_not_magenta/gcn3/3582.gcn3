D. Malesani (SISSA), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), E. Palazzi (INAF/IASF, Bo), 
G.L. Israel (INAF, OARm), G. Chincarini (Univ. Milano-Bicocca), L. 
Stella (INAF, OARm), M. Pedani (INAF, TNG) report on behalf on a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 050713 (Falcone et al., GCN 3581) with the 
Italian TNG telescope, located at the Canary Islands.

The object was observed after twilight, with a seeing of ~1.4", starting 
at 5.274 UT (0.8 h after the GRB). A 2-minutes exposure was acquired in 
the I filter.

Inside the XRT error circle, we detect one source at the coordinates 
(J2000):

  alpha = 21:22:09.6,  delta = +77:04:29
   
with an uncertainty of ~1".

We note two further objects lying just outside the nominal XRT error circle:

  1: alpha = 21:22:11.8,  delta = +77:04:27
  2: alpha = 21:22:08.4,  delta = +77:04:39

All these object are fainter than the DSS limit, so we cannot confirm if 
any of them is related to the GRB. Further analysis is in progress.
