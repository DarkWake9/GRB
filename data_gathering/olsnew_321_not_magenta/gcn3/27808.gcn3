Paul Kuin (MSSL/UCL) and Kim Page (Leicester University)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 200524
36366 s after the LAT trigger (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 27798).
The initial Swift UVOT follow up missed the likely afterglow of 200524A as
reported by Ho et al, GCN Circ. 27799, and confirmed by Kumar et al.
GCN Circ. 27800/27804/27806, Rumyantsev et al. GCN Circ. 27802,
Sanwal et al. GCN Circ. 27803, Perley et al., GCN Circ. 27805 and de
Ugarte Postigo et al, GCN.Circ. 27807. The UVOT field of view is smaller
than the XRT field of view and  XRT source 6 (Evans et al., GCN Circ.
 27798), which is consistent with the PTF source, falls outside the field
observed by Swift UVOT.
