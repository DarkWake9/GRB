D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, RHESSI, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB
at 35106 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately  10 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
5.8E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 349.492, -41.979 degrees, whose radius is 22.224 +/-  0.137
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
