V. D'Elia (ASDC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA),
D. M. Palmer (LANL), B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and
M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:13:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 141005A (trigger=614415).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 291.108, +36.069, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 24m 26s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 04' 10"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 05:14:39.5 UT, 92.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 291.09313, 36.09517 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 24m 22.35s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 05' 42.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 103 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.56
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting 93
seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been found
in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of the XRT
error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board
covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete
to about 18.0 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.17. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
