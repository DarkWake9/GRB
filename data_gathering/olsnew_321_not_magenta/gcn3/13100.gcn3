The long GRB 120324A (Swift-BAT trigger #518507:
Zhang et al., GCN 13090; Cummings et al., GCN 13096)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=21550.757s UT (05:59:10.757)

The light curve shows multiple peaks
with a total burst duration of ~65 s.
The emission is seen up to ~9 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120324_T21550/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (4.5 ± 1.2)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.768 s,
of (3.7 ± 0.9)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+41.216 s)
is best fitted in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.02 (-0.10, +0.11),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.3 (-1.0, +0.3),
the peak energy Ep = 445(-80, +117) keV,
chi2 = 82.3/86 dof.

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is best fitted
is best fitted in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.87 (-0.12, +0.15),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.6 (<-2.1),
the peak energy Ep = 504(-103, +135) keV,
chi2 = 90.9/86 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
