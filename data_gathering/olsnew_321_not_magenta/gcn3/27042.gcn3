The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S200213t during
real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO
Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2020-02-13
04:10:40.328 UTC (GPS time: 1265602258.328). The candidate was found
by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.

S200213t is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as
estimated by the online analysis, is 1.8e-08 Hz, or about one in 1
year, 9 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:
https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S200213t

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending
probability, is BNS (63%), Terrestrial (37%), BBH (<1%), MassGap
(<1%), or NSBH (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability
that the lighter compact object has a mass < 3 solar masses (HasNS) is
>99%. Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the
probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is
>99%.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the
GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.fits.gz,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR
[2], distributed via GCN notice about 2 minutes after the candidate
event time.
 * bayestar.fits.gz,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR
[2], distributed via GCN notice about 7 minutes after the candidate
event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.fits.gz,1. For the
bayestar.fits.gz,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 2587 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 224 +/- 90 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).
