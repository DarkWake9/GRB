The long-duration, intense GRB 141215A
(IPN triangulation: Hurley et al., GCN 17186)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=48373.645 s UT (13:26:13.645).

The light curve shows a multi-peaked structure with
a total duration of ~15 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of 2.8(-0.3,+0.3)x10^-5 erg/cm2, and a 64-ms peak flux,
measured from T0+10.560 s, of 7.7(-0.8,+0.8)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+13.824 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 15 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.29 (-0.14,+0.14),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.80 (-0.69,+0.25),
the peak energy Ep = 241 (-17,+28) keV,
chi2 = 102/97 dof.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
