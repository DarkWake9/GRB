J. R. Cummings (UMBC/CRESST/GSFC) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

The probable new Galactic transient reported in GCN Circular # 14821 was not
a new source. It was a known source (4U 1700-377) reported in an incorrect
position.  The cause of the error of ~0.4 degrees is not yet known.  The
Swift star tracker was correctly locked during the observation and the source
was found in the correct position in all image sub-intervals that made up the
summed image interval that resulted in the erroneous report.  We regret any
inconvenience.
