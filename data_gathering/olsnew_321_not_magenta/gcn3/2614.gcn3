report:

We observed the field of GRB 040624 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 2613) with
the Tautenburg 1.34-m Schmidt telescope equipped with the Schmidt focus
CCD camera under good observing conditions but high airmass. Observations
were performed on 24.885 UT (0.54 days after the burst) in I and on 24.889
UT in R. A first visual inspection of the images does not reveal any new
source down to the DSS2 red limit.
