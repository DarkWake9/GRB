We observed the location of the Swift J014008.5+343403.6 (Emery et al., 
LVC GCNs 21733, 21758; discovered 1.95 days post-LVC trigger) with the 
AMI Large Array. Our observations at 15 GHz carried out on Aug 31.06, 
Sep 02.15 and Sep 08.12 UT (5.5d, 7.6d and 13.6d post-trigger 
respectively) do not reveal any radio afterglow associated with the 
optical transient, with 3sigma upper limits of 111 uJy, 160 uJy and 127 uJy.

We thank the AMI-LA staff for scheduling these observations.
