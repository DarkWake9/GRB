report:

We observed the field of GRB 130606A (Ukwatta, et al., GCN 14781) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/06 8.18 to 2013/06 8.46 UTC (31.14 to
37.86 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.96 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 2.07 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and
H bands.

The optical/NIR afterglow (Jelinek, et al., GCN 14782; Xu et al., GCN
14783) is well detected.   In comparison with SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain
the following detections and 3-sigma upper limit:

 r'  >24.06
 i'  24.06 +/- 0.27
 Z   21.50 +/- 0.09
 Y   21.41 +/- 0.12
 J   21.16 +/- 0.12
 H   20.78 +/- 0.12

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  In comparison to our observations
on the previous night (2013/06/07; Butler, et al., GCN 14799), the
afterglow has faded by about 3 magnitudes in all bands.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
