D. Frederiks, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:

Assuming z=0.356 (Thöne et al., GCN 14744),
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,
Omega_M = 0.27, and Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
we estimate the following rest-frame parameters of GRB 130603B
from the Konus-Wind observation of the burst (Golenetskii et al., GCN 14771):
the isotropic energy release E_iso is (2.1 ± 0.2)x10^51 erg,
the peak luminosity (L_iso)_max is (4.4 ± 0.8)x10^52 erg/s,
and the rest-frame peak energy Ep,i = (900 ± 140) keV
