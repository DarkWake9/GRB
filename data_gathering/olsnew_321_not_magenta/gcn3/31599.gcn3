The short-duration GRB 220211A
(Fermi-GBM detection: The Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 31570;
Veres and Meegan GCN Circ. 31591;
Swift/BAT-GUANO detection: Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circ. 31582;
IPN triangulation: Ridnaia et al., GCN Circ. 31584)
triggered Konus-Wind (KW) at T0=4070.727 s UT (01:07:50.727).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with
the total duration of ~54 ms (20-1500 keV).

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB220211_T04070/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had
a fluence of 3.86(-0.53,+0.82)x10^-7 erg/cm^2 and
a 16-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0-0.040 s,
of 9.6(-2.1,+2.6)x10^-6 erg/cm^2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the main fraction of the burst emission was detected
before the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modelling the time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0-0.050 s to T0+0.004 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep),
yields alpha = 0.77(-0.62,+1.32) and Ep = 413(-74,+88) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 68% confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
