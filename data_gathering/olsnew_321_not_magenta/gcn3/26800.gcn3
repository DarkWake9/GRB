The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:24:06 UT on 17 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200117A (trigger 600956651.532182 / 200117517).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 129.7, Dec = -62.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 38m, -62d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 133.0 degrees.
