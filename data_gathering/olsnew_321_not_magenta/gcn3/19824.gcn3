We observed the field of the Fermi GRB 160816A (Mailyan, et al.,
GCN 19804) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at
the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir
from 2016/08 19.16 to 2016/08 19.50 UTC (2.43 to 2.77 days after
the GBM trigger), obtaining a total of 5.58 hours exposure in the
r and i bands and 4.56 hours exposure in the Z and J bands.

For the source reported in Troja, et al. (GCN 19809), in comparison
with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the  following
detections:

   r    23.45 +/- 0.15
   i    23.18 +/- 0.12
   Z    22.64 +/- 0.12
   J    22.37 +/- 0.16

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
