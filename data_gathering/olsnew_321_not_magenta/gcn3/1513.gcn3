Mike Gladders (Carnegie Observatories) and Pat Hall
(Princeton/Catolica) report: 

"A total of 37 images (16 in I, 10 in R, 11 in V) of the OT associated
with GRB020813 were acquired with the Baade 6.5m (Magellan I)
telescope and TEK5 camera on the night of August 13 UT, under
conditions of excellent seeing and transparency. A further 15 images
(5 in I, 4 each in BR and 2 in V) were acquired on the night of August
14 UT, under similar conditions, though with some possible cirrus.

"A preliminary analysis of these images yields the magnitudes below
for the OT associated with GRB020813. Magnitudes have been computed
differentially relative to approximately 20 stars straddling the
magnitude range of OT, located in the same field (2x2 arcminutes).
Internal uncertainties (estimated from residuals in the differential
corrections) are about 0.01 magnitudes on August 13 UT, and about 0.02
on August 14UT, and the systematic uncertainty in the calibration of
the zero-points is less than 0.05 magnitudes in most cases. The B-band
zero-point, established on August 14 UT, may be affected by light
cirrus on the science frames, and is questionable."
