A. S. Moskvitin,  V. N. Aitov (SAO RAS)
on behalf of GRB follow-up team report.

We observed the field of the GRB 200829A (Siegel et al., GCN 28307)
with Zeiss-1000 (1-m telescope of SAO RAS) equipped with
Multi-Mode Photometer-Polarimeter (MMPP) on August 30. We obtained
5 x 300 sec. frames in Rc band and similar sequence in Ic band.

The OT (Siegel et al., GCN 28307; Pozanenko et al., GCN 28308;
Kuin and Siegel, GCN 28311; Lipunov et al., GCN 28315; Vinko et al.,
28316; Hentunen and Nissinen,  GCN 28318; Zhu et al., GCN 28324)
is clearly detected in individual images as well as stacked frames
with the brightness of R =  20.37 +/- 0.13 (T_mid - T0 = 1.1492 days),
I = 20.14 +/- 0.10 (T_mid - T0 = 1.1662 days).
Preliminary photometry is based on R2 and I magnitudes
of the same nearby USNO-B1 stars (Moskvitin and Aitov, GCN 28322).
