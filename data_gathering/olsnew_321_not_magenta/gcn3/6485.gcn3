D. Shakhovskoy, V. Rumyantsev (CrAO),  V. Biryukov (CrAO, SAI MSU),
A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB070520B (Moretti et al., GCN 6425) with AZT-11
(1.25m)  telescope of CrAO  in R-band under not optimal weather conditions
(seeing ~3.6 arcsec) on May 20 between (UT)18:47 and 19:21, i.e. starting 1
hour after burst onset. The weather condition No object is found in a
refined XRT error box (Moretti et al., GCN 6438 ). Limiting magnitude of a
combined image is based on USANO A2.0:

Mid time (UT),  Exposure,    R_Lim (3sigma)
May 20.753      6x300        21.0
