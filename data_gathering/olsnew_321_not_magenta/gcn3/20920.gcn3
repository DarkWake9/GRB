We observed the field of GRB 170317A (LaPorte et al., GCN 20885) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/03 19.13 to 2017/03 19.30
UTC (41.26 to 45.37 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
2.84 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 1.19 hours exposure in the
Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the enhanced Swift-XRT error circle (Beardmore et
al., GCN 20887), in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we
obtain the following detections and 3-sigma upper limits:

 r	23.70 +/- 0.10
 i	23.93 +/- 0.26
 Z	> 23.07
 Y	> 22.51
 J	> 22.27
 H	> 21.75

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source has faded by about a magnitude in r and i since our earlier
observations (Watson et al., GCN 20911).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
