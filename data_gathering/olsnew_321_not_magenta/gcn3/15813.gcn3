U.Quadri, L.Strabla and R.Girelli report:

We imaged the field of GRB 140206A detected by SWIFT(trigger 585834)
with the robotic telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory, Italy (member of ISSP:Italian Supernovae Search Project)

The observations started  85h 35m after the GRB trigger,  
with our schmidt telescope D=320/400 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added 2 series of 15 exposures of 120 sec each.

We did not found any optical counterpart
in the error box of the XRTcandidate.
