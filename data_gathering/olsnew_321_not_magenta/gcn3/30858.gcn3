We carried out follow-up observations of GRB210919A (A. Tohuvanohu et al.
GCNC #30846) with Keck II, using the NIRC2 instrument with the wide camera.
Observations began on September 19 at 13:48:32.649 UT , ~13.3 hours after
the GRB trigger. We took 6 X 107s exposures using the Kp filter. No GRB IR
counterpart was found in the NIRC2 data within the XRT error area (M. R.
Goad et al. GCNC #30850).

No GRB IR counterpart was found in the NIRC2 data within the XRT error area
(M. R. Goad et al. GCNC #30850) to an upper limit of Kp > 21.5 mag (AB,
with no Galactic extinction correction).
