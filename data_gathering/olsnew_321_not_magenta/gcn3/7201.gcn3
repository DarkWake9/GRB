The position of XRF 080109 / SN 2008D was observed by Giant
Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) as ToO at 1280 MHz. The observation took
place from UT 20.68 to 21.00 January, 2008. It was started after 11.11
days of the beginning of the burst (GCN 7172). The preliminary
analysis suggest that the upper limit of the flux density at the
position of XRF 080109 (GCN 7190, GCN 7178) is 160 microJy with 235
micro Jy three sigma noise level. One sigma rms noise of the image is
45 microJy.

We thank the staffs of the GMRT who have made this ToO observation
possible and have given the data to us. GMRT is run by the National Centre 
for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
