report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 05:15:28.02 UT on 20 June 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered
and located GRB 140620A, which was observed by the intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory beginning 10 minutes after trigger time, and was reported
in GCN 16425 (Kasliwal, Cenko, and Singer) as iPTF14cva.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 278, DEC = +43 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 18h 34m, +43d 0.0'), with an uncertainty
of 2 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 46 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4 s to T0+35 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.1 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 77 +/- 5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.3 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 6.3 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
