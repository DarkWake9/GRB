report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, the ground search of GECAM-B data found
a long burst, GRB 210207B, at 2021-02-07T21:52:14.050 UTC (T0), which
was also reported by Swift/BAT (GCN #29420, #29435), Konus/Wind (GCN #29426),
AGILE (GCN #29428) and Insight-HXMT/HE (GCN #29434). 
The later bright pulse also triggered GECAM-B in-flight.

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 8 keV-4 MeV, this burst
mainly consists of multiple pulses with a duration (T90) of 45.0 +/- 4.5 s
starting from T0 - 1.8 s. The 1-s peak counts rate is about 1300 cps
while the total counts is about 4600 counts.

Although the in-flight calibration of energy response and
localization has not been finalized yet, GECAM-B localized this burst to
the following position (J2000):

Ra: 275.00 deg Dec: 51.57 deg
Err: 8.23 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)

The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

This position is consistent with Swift (GCN #29420) within the error.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
