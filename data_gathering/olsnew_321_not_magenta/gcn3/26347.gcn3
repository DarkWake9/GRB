The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:46:20 UT on 5 Dec 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191205A (trigger 597260785.441392 / 191205741).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 14.0, Dec = -34.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 56m, -34d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 21.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 42.0 degrees.
