behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We imaged the field of the Swift GRB 121017A (Grupe et al., GCN Circ.
13875) with the 1.23m Calar Alto telescope. The observations were carried
out in the R-band on Oct. 17.85440--17.86153 UT (1.11--1.29 hours post
burst) with a total exposure time of 2x300s. No optical source brighter
than R~20 was found within the XRT error circle."
