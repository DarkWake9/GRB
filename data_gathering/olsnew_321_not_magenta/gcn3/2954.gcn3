After  SWIFT alert  (GCN 2951)  MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had  imaging  the
corresponding area of the sky  under the bad weather conditions.  We have
50  unfiltered images of the error box (45s exposition, 6 square degrees
field) started at 17 Jan 2005	14:58:40 UT (2 hours after  GRB time).
The limiting magnitude on the summ of the best 10 images was about 19.0.

There is no  OT within  the 0'5 SWIFT error circle.
The central part of the JPG-images  are available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/SRG1806-20/050117/summ10.jpg
