B. Sbarufatti, V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA), report on behalf of the Swift- 
XRT team:

Swift began observation of the XRF detected by INTEGRAL  (Paizis, et  
al., GCN Circ. 9603) on 2009 July 2 at 14:15 UT, 3.5 hours after the  
trigger. In the XRT field of view we detect a single faint,  
uncatalogued source inside the IBIS/ISGRI error circle with a 5.5  
sigma significance. The XRT position obtained using a 6ks Photon  
Counting mode exposure is RA, Dec =
175.89800, 11.50219 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  11 43 35.5
Dec (J2000): +11 30 07.9

with an uncertainty of 4.9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is  
0.6 arcmin away from the INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI position. The count-rate  
is (6.8+/-1.2)E-3 counts/s, for a total of 40 observed photons from  
the source. With the current amount of data we are unable to see if  
the source is fading.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
