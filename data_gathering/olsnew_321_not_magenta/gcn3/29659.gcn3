The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:08:29 UT on 17 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210317A (trigger 637664914.045098 / 210317381).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 154.2, Dec = -64.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 16m, -64d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 159.0 degrees.
