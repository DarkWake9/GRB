D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The Palomar 60-inch robotic telescope responded to the Swift alert for 
GRB 150203A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 17377) and began automatic follow-up at 
04:11:42 UT, 155 s after the BAT trigger.  The telescope acquired a 
series of cycling 60-second r, i, and z exposures under good seeing 
conditions.

We detect no source in or near the XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 
17378), in any individual exposure or in a stack of the first several 
minutes of imaging acquired in each filter.  An approximate limiting 
magnitude of the r-band stack (7 minutes of imaging at a median time of 
13.0 minutes post-trigger) is >21.5 mag, calibrated relative to USNO B1.0.

Given the low galactic latitude, no further follow-up is planned.
