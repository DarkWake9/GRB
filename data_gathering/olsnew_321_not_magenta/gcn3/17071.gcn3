report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team

Swift-XRT has observed again a field in the error box of the IPN GRB  
141104A (Hurley et al. GCN 17026). The total exposure time of the new  
observation, which started ~ 10 days after the IPN trigger, is 9 ks.  
Source #2 reported in D'Elia & Izzo (GCN 17036) is still detected with  
a consistent count rate, while source #1 is marginally detected at a  
S/N level just below 3. The count rate of the new detection clearly  
implies fading between the two epochs. Despite the slow temporal decay  
(t^-0.55) and the flux variation of a factor of just two that can not  
exclude another origin, source #1 is the best afterglow candidate for  
GRB 141104A. Further observations are Sun constrained until February  
2015.
