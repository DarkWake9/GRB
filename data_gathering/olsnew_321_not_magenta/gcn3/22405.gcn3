report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 22:58:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) detected
the known RS CVn star HD 8357 (trigger=809217) in a 320s image. 
Swift slewed immediately to the location.  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is 
RA, Dec 20.786, +7.444 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 23m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 26' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger,
no obvious variation is detectable in the immediately available
BAT rates lightcurve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:05:26.8 UT, 387.4 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright X-ray source located at RA, Dec
20.7371, 7.4200 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = +01h 22m 56.90s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 25' 12.0"
with an uncertainty of 4.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 194 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, outside the
BAT error circle. This position is 1.9 arcseconds from that of a known
X-ray source: 3XMM J012256.8+072510 in the XMM-NEWTON XMMSSC catalogue
and is consistent with the position of HD 8357. 

Assuming a typical GRB power-law spectrum (NH=3e21 cm^-2, gamma=2), the
XMM catalogue entry for this object is equivalent to a 0.2-10 keV flux of
6.2e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1; the flux in the 2.5 s XRT image was 7.63e-09
erg cm^-2 s^-1. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

Because HD 8357 is a known bright star (V=7.31) UVOT did not
take data. 

This appears to be the first time that this source has triggered
BAT in the on-board imaging.
