Minaev, P., Pozanenko, A.,  Chelovekov, I., Grebenev, S. report on 
behalf of GRB IKI FuN:

We report results of analysis  of INTEGRAL observations of GRB 210704A. 
We used  publicly available data. GRB 210704A was initially reported by 
X-/gamma-ray experiments (Ursi et al., GCN 30372; Berretta et al., GCN 
30375; Prasad et al., GCN 30378; D'Ai et al., GCN 30379; Malacaria et 
al., GCN 30380; Ridnaia et al., GCN 30388). The burst was detected by 
SPI-ACS at (UTC) 2021-07-04T19:33:24.5. Its duration in the SPI-ACS 
energy band (> 80 keV) is T_90 = 3.5 +/- 0.7 s. Comparing fluences of 
long-duration GRBs simultaneously recorded by SPI-ACS and Fermi/GBM 
(Chelovekov et al., in preparation) we estimated the GRB 210704A fluence 
to be 1.8e-5 erg/cm^2 in the 10-1000 keV band (the 95% confidence region 
which includes systematics was 5.2e-6 â€“ 6.3e-5 erg/cm^2).  We did not 
detect any signature of an extended emission in the SPI-ACS energy band 
(> 80 keV). GRB 210704A was also detected by ISGRI detector as 106 
degrees off-axis event.  The light curve of both SPI-ACS and ISGRI can 
be found at
