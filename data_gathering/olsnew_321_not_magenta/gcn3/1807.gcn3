report:


Further analysis of the 1.5-m OSN B-band images
obtained covering the GRB 030115 error box, suggests
that the optical candidate previously reported (GCN
Circ. 1805) seems to be a reddened object that is also
present in the DDS-2 (R and B). Taking into account
that there is no other obvious optical counterpart within
the HETE-2 error box down to R about 20 on Jan 15.220
UT (i.e 1h 55m after the trigger),  this GRB would be a
good candidate for an optically dim/dark burst. Deeper
optical and IR observations are encouraged.
