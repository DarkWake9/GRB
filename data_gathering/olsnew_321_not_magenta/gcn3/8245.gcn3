Adam Goldstein (UAH) and Alexander van der Horst (NASA/MSFC) report on
behalf of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Team:

"At 00:12:45 UT on 16 September 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located the bright GRB 080916C (trigger 243216766 /
080916.009). The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data,
is RA = 121.8,  Dec = -61.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 8h 07m,
-61d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of less than 1 degree (radius,
1-sigma
containment) and an additional systematic error which is currently estimated
to be 2 to 3 degrees. The angle from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
boresight is 52 degrees.

This GRB has several peaks, with T90 (50-300 keV) = 66 s and
T50 (50-300 keV) = 33 s. This burst is detected up to several MeV;
spectral analysis is ongoing."
