The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 05:30:49 UT on 30 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201130A (trigger 628407054.55185 / 201130230).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 165.9, Dec = 29.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 03m, 29d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 21.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
