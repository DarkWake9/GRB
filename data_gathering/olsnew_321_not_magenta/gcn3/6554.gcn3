T. Ishimura, Y. Yatsu, T. Shimokawabe, N. Vasquez, Y.kudo, and 
N. Kawai (TokyoTech) report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the error box of GRB070616 (Starling et al. GCN 6542)
with the 3-color 50cm MITSuME Telescope at Akeno, Japan starting
at 16:52:26 June 16 UT, 22m53s after the trigger under a poor sky
condition with clouds and a high airmass.
In the co-added images of Ic, Rc, and g' bands, we did not detect
any afterglow candidate in the XRT error circle.  The 3-sigma limiting
magnitudes based on USNO-B1.0 (I-band) and NOMAD (R-band,g'-band)
stars are following.
