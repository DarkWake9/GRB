We observed the field of GRB 181103A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 23402) 
using the Nanshan-1m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We 
optained 5¡Á300s, 1¡Á400s, 1¡Á600s R-band frames, starting at 23:07:05 UT 
on 2018-11-03, i.e, 18.73 hr after the Swift trigger.

No optical source was detected in the stacked image at the XRT position 
(Evans et al, GCN 23403), down to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 21.3 mag 
at the median time of 19.31hr post-burst, calibrated with the nearby 
SDSS field.
