TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2175
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030426 (annulus)

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 84600 s.  As
observed by INTEGRAL, it had a duration of approximately 50 s.  Peak
fluxes and fluences cannot be estimated at this time.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 152.962, 38.145 degrees, whose radius is 83.022 +/-  0.027
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as this
event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot
be obtained for it.
