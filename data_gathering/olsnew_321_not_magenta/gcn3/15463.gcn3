We again observed the field of GRB 131030A (Troja, et al., GCN
Circ. 15402) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from
2013/11 7.09 to 2013/11 7.33 UTC (173.34 to 178.87 hours after the
BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.40 hours exposure in the r
and i bands and 1.41 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison
with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r     > 23.52
  i     > 23.11
  Z     > 22.69
  Y     > 22.17
  J     > 21.87
  H     > 21.35

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for
Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB. The upper limits
obtained in the r and i bands are consistent with the reported
decay from previous epochs of RATIR observations (Littlejohns, et
al., GCN Circ. 15462).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
