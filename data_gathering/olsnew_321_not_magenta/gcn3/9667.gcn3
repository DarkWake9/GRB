S. B. Pandey (U Mich), S.A. Yost (College of St. Benedict), W. Zheng,
F. Yuan (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to the short-hard GRB 090715A (Swift trigger 357498,  Racusin J. L., GCN 9666), producing images
beginning 7.1 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took
the first image at 17:26:05.1 UT, 25.9 s after the burst, under fair
conditions.
We took 10 5-sec and 10 20-sec exposures and imaging is ongoing.
These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). 

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources
within the 3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle, for both single images and
coadding into sets of 10.
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 15.4-16.6; we
set the following specific limits.
start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
