S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo 
(ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 130 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 20:20:30 UT of April 1, 2016.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=  89.7377  deg
DEC.=  26.6758  deg

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.7 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 1e-6 erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
