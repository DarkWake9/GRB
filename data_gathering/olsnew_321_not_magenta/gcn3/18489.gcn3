Swift performed follow-up observations of the rapidly-brightening
optical transient LSQ15bjb reported by Rabinowitz et al (GCN Circ.
18473) inside the LIGO error region for trigger G194575. The
observations began at 01:20 UT on October 27.

No X-ray sources are found in the image. At the location of the La
Silla-QUEST source there are no events recorded in 2ks of exposure time.
The 3-sigma upper limit deduced from these data is 3.5e-3 ct/sec,
corresponding to an approximate flux of 1.4e-13 erg/cm^2/s.

UVOT took an exposure of 1370 s with the U filter starting at 01:20:05
UT, and a second exposure of 585 s with the U filter starting at
02:36:43. The source LSQ15bjb is detected with a preliminary u magnitude
of 16.79 ± 0.07 in the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011,
AIP Conf. Proce. 1358, 373) in the first exposure and 16.73 ± 0.07 in
the second. We caution that the source is not well separated from the
nearby galaxy.

The magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction due to the
reddening of E(B-V) = 0.03 in the direction of the source (Schlegel et
al. 1998).
