Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of the iPTF transient 15fhl (Cenko et al. GCN 18762);
RA(J2000)=12h 28m 13.60s Dec(J2000)=+17d 37â€™ 01.4''), located in the error
region of LIGO/Virgo G211117 (LVC et al., GCN 18728), with the Karl G.
Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA). The observations started on 30 Dec 10:28:35 UT,
ended
on 30 Dec 11:28:15 UT, and were carried out in C-band (central frequency of
about 6 GHz) with the VLA in its D configuration. Analysis is ongoing and
further observations are planned.
