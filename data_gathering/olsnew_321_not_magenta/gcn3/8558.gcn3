Andreev M., Sergeev A.,  (Terskol Branch of Institute of Astronomy),  A. 
Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed   the field of GRB 081126 detected by SWIFT (trigger 335647, 
Margutti et al GCN8554 ) with the Z-600  telescope of Mt. Terskol 
observatory.  A set of  90 s unfiltered exposures was taken starting (UT) 
Nov. 26 22:07:20.  In a combined image of  3x90 s we detect a new object 
not presented in DSS2(R), in near vicinity to the object of USNO-A2.0 
1350-14391154. A preliminary astrometry of the new object based on 
USNO-A2.0  is RA, Dec (J2000) = 21 34 03.56   +48 42 38.62 with 
uncertainty of 1", which is formally outside of  enhanced XRT position 
(Osborne et al GCN 8556).  It is not clear at this moment relation of the 
new object with GRB  081126.
