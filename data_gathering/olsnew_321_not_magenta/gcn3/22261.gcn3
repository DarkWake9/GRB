P. Dâ€™Avanzo, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift team: 
Swift-XRT has performed a second epoch of observations of the Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 171210A (Bissaldi et al. GCN Circ. 22228), collecting 4.4 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+563.0 ks and T0+662.2 ks. None of the five XRT-detected sources reported in Burrows at al. (GCN Circ. 22235) show any sign of significant fading between the two epochs of observation. We conclude that we have not detected the GRB afterglow. 
This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
