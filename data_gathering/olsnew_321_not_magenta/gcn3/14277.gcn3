Using 11 seconds of event data covering part of the burst, we present
further analysis of GRB 130305A (Cummings and Palmer, GCN # 14257).  This
was a ground-detected burst on the edge of the BAT field of view.  The
best BAT position is RA, Dec 116.774, +52.037, which is:

RA (J2000)   07h 47m 05.8s
Dec (J2000)  52d 02m 11s

with an estimated uncertainty radius of 1.8 arcmin (90% containment).  This
position is 1.0 arcmin from the XRT afterglow position (Malesani et al,
GCN # 14263).

The BAT mask-weighted lightcurve does not show more detail than the raw
lightcurve due to the extreme partial coding (2.5%).  There is a single
peak, approximately symmetrical, a total of about 20 seconds long.  Note,
however, the much longer duration mentioned at high energy by the
Konus-Wind team (Golenetskii et al., GCN # 14262.

The following spectral results appear to cover about 90% of the total flux
of the burst, based on the raw lightcurve excess over constant background.
Again, the partial coding makes the uncertainty of the fit parameters large.
A fit to a simple power law function has a photon index of 0.78 +/- 0.20.
This is harder than most other BAT-detected long GRBs.  The fluence from
15-150 keV was (4.8 +/- 1.8) x 10^-6 ergs/cm^2.
