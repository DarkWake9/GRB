A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Combining all of the data for this event (GCN 1786, 1787, 1790, and
1792) constrains the annulus given in GCN 1792 further.  The arrival
direction is that portion of the annulus (centered at RA, Decl(2000)=
1.888, -37.630 degrees, radius 14.843 +/-  0.137 degrees) between RA,
Decl = 344, -34 degrees, and 348, -49 degrees.  Only small improvements
to this localization are expected at this stage.
