Brajesh Kumar, S. B. Pandey and Rupak Roy (ARIES, NainiTal, India, on
behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration)

GRB 081128, localized by Swift (Margutti et al. GCN 8571), was observed
with 1.04m telescope at NainiTal starting ~ 2.5 hours after the burst
in R_c filter.

Photometry of the co-added R_c frames (300 sec x 5) does not detect the
optical afterglow candidate (Wang et al. GCN 8572) down to a limiting
magnitude of ~ 20 mag in comparison to nearby USNO stars.
