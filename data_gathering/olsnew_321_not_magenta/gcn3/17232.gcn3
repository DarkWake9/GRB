D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), T. Augusteijn (NOT), and P. Jakobsson (Univ. 
Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 141225A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 17229) with 
the Nordic Optical telescope equipped with the MOSCA camera. 
Observations started at 23:25:08 UT (0.40 hr after the GRB trigger) and 
were conducted in the SDSS r band.

Consistent with the XRT position (see 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/), we detect a bright source not 
present in the DSS, which is likely the optical afterglow of GRB 
141225A. Its coordinates are (J2000):

RA = 09:15:06.89
Dec = +33:47:30.8

and an approximate magnitude of R ~ 19.5 (Vega; assuming R = 16.2 for 
the USNO star at RA = 09:15:09.46, Dec = +33:47:48.7).

This is the same source reported by Gorosabel et al. (GCN 17230) and 
Guidorzi et al. (GCN 17231).
