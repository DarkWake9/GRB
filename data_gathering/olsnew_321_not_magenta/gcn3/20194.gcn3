Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161117A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 722604) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 26s after the GRB trigger
(14s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
48 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

A difficulty is the presence of the bright star
NOMAD1 0603-1050209 (ra=322.0444192 dec=-29.6163561)
of magnitude R=11.060 located at 25 arcsec from the
the GRB provided at by Marshall et al. (GCNC 20190).

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:

t0+26s to t0+86s : Rlim = 16.8

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
