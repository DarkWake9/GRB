GRB 120514A: TAROT Calern observatory optical observations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120514A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 522197) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 534s after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
37 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures.
We do not detect any OT in the XRT error box
with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+534s to t0+909s : R > 18.1

Galactic coordinates are lon= 29.2060 lat= -2.0542
and the galactic extinction in R band is 4.3 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
