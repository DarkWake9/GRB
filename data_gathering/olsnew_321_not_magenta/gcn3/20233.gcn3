Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161202A (trigger #725036)
(Sbarufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 20227).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 356.904, 19.652 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  23h 47m 36.9s
  Dec(J2000) = +19d 39' 06.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.

The first peaks of the burst occurred before it came into the BAT field of view
at ~T-67 s. The mask-weighted light curve shows more than ten pulses that
last till ~T+80 s.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-63.41 to T+65.79 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.55 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.6 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
