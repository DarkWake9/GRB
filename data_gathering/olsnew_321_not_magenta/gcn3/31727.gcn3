The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:55:07 UT on 10 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220310B (trigger 668573712.866702 / 220310122).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 63.8, Dec = 69.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 15m, 69d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 128.0 degrees.
