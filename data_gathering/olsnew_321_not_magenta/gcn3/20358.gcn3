D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space) and K. L. Page (U Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:32:00 UT, Swift-BAT triggered (trigger number 729600) on what 
appears to be noise during the count rate rise associated with entry 
into the South Atlantic Anomaly. The image significance is low (6.1 
sigma) and there is no significant peak in the light curve. There is
also no detection of a source by the XRT. Thus we believe that this
trigger is not due to a GRB or other astrophysical  event.
