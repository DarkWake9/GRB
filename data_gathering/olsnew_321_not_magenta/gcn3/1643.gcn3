TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1643
SUBJECT: SGR1900+14: burst on October 10 2002
DATE:    02/10/17 20:46:01 GMT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets, S. Golenetskii, and D. Frederiks, on behalf of the
Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed this burst at 84276 s.  As observed by
Ulysses, it had a duration of ~150 ms, a 25-100 keV fluence of ~7E-7
erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 32 ms of 3E-6 erg/cm2 s.  The burst
triggered Ulysses, but was observed in waiting mode (~ 3 s resolution)
by Konus, which had triggered on a solar flare.  We have triangulated
it to an annulus centered at RA, Decl= 356.131, -36.621 degrees, whose
radius is 79.502 +/- 0.056 degrees.  As the center line of this annulus
passes within 0.049 degrees of SGR1900+14, we conclude that this event
originated from that source.

Only small improvements to this localization are expected.

A subsequent short burst was detected by Ulysses on October 11
at 35680 s (Ulysses time).  This burst has not yet been confirmed
by any other spacecraft, but if it originated from SGR1900+14,
its Earth-crossing time would have been around 35420 s.

As of October 16, no other short events have been detected
by Ulysses.
