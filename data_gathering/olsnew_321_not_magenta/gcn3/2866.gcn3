TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2866
SUBJECT: GRB 041219 - A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    04/12/19 03:31:58 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), S.Shaw, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix),
J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A very long (about 9 minutes ) and bright GRB has been detected with the
INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS) on December 19 at 01:43 UT. The GRB has
been detected with IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band (IBAS Alert # 2073).

Its coordinates (J2000)  are:

  RA:  6.1075 [degrees]
 DEC: +62.8349 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin  (90% c.l. radius)

The brightest part of the burst saturated the available telemetry.
Therefore at the moment we can only estimate a lower limit to the peak
flux in the 20-200 keV range. This is about 12 photons/cmsq/s (1E-6
erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).
