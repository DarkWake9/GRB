larger Indian GRB collaboration

We observed INTEGRAL/Swift GRB 041219 localization by Gotz et al. (GCN 
2866) with 1.04m telescope at ARIES NainiTal. In a single 900 sec R_c 
band frame, we did not detect the optical afterglow at the IR afterglow 
position of the source by Blake & Bloom (GCN 2870). We put an upper 
limit ~ 21 mag, around 13 hours after the burst.
