Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 090417B (GCN 9135) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Apr. 19.37
UT. The GRB radio afterglow is undetected within the Swift-XRt error
circle (GCN 9155). We place the three-sigma upper limit of 120 uJy on
the GRB afterglow.
