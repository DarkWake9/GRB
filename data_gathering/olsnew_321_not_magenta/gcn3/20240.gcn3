The long-duration GRB 161203A (Konus-Wind trigger time on 18:41:06.318;
INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger #7641) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (CGBM) at 18:41:07.71 on 3 December 2016.  The burst signal was
seen by all CGBM instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground
alert processing script, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically
for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows at least two overlapping peaks.  The first
peak starts at T-1 sec, peaks at T+0.5 sec and ends at T+2 sec.  The second
peak, which is the brightest peak, starts at T+2 sec, peaks at T+3.5 sec and
ends at T+6 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
5.4 +- 0.8 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
