Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 141015A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 615399) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 55s after the GRB trigger
(19s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
42 degrees above horizon but it was dawn
(sun elevation -11 deg).

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+55s to t0+115s : R > 12.2

Later images were acquired in tracking mode until 521
seconds after the trigger. We detect no optical afterglow
at Rlim = 12.5

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
