D. Xu (DARK/NBI) and T.M. Zhang (NAOC) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration

We observed the field of GRB 130215A (D'Elia et al., GCN 14204) using
the Xinglong 2.16m telescope, located in Heibei China and equipped
with the BFOSC camera. Observations started at 10:57:59 UT on
2013-02-15 (i.e., 9.941 hr after the BAT trigger), and 3x300s R-band
and I-band frames were obtained, respectively.

The optical afterglow (Zheng et al., GCN 14205; LaCluyze et al., GCN
14206; Cenko, GCN 14209; Butler et al., GCN 14212; Gendre et al., GCN
14213) is clearly detected in each of our images. Compared with the
measurements in previous GCN reports, it decayed to R=19.1 mag at the
mean time of 10.08 hr post-trigger, in the staked image and calibrated
with nearby USNO B1 stars.

We thank Feng Xiao for carrying out these observations.
