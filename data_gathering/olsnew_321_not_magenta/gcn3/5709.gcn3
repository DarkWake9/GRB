We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 061007 (GCN 5706, 5707, 5708)
with the 2m Faulkes Telescope South (Siding Spring).  At 142 sec after
trigger time, we measure a magnitude of mR=10.15 +/- 0.04 (calibration based
on USNOB1 R2 mag, which may introduce a 0.3 mag systematic uncertainty).
When compared to the magnitude measured by ROTSE (m=13.6, GCN 5706),
this implies a subtantial brightening in the first 2.5 minutes (more
than a factor of 10 between 26 and 142 seconds).

From 142s on, the OT is seen to decay. For the next three hours,
the decay followed a power law with an index of about -1.55 +/- 0.05.

The position of the afterglow is 03:05:19.56, -50:30:2.7 +/- 1.2"

Observations and analysis are continuing.
