D. Fugazza (INAF-OABr), L.A. Antonelli, V. Testa (INAF-OAR), L. Di 
Fabrizio, G. Tessicini (INAF-TNG), and D. Malesani (SISSA), report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the field of GRB 050421 (Barbier et al., GCN 3296) with the 
Italian 3.6m TNG. Observations were carried out under moderate observing 
conditions (seeing ~0.8"), just before the dawn. Exposures were acquired 
in the K filter, for a total integration time of 20 min, starting on Apr 
21.2313 UT (mean time Apr 21.2453 UT, 1.7 h after the GRB).

We find no sources within the XRT error circle, down to a limiting 
magnitude K = 18.6 (3 sigma).
