TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  222
SUBJECT: GRB990123 IPN annulus
DATE:    99/01/25 18:10:30 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN3 team, and M. Feroci, on
behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report: 

We have obtained a preliminary IPN3 annulus for GRB990123
by triangulation using Ulysses and the BeppoSAX GRBM.  The
annulus is centered at RA(2000)=163.7197 degrees, Dec(2000)=
-9.4661 degrees, with a radius of 81.3372 degrees and a
3 sigma width of 2.67 arcminutes.  This annulus reduces slightly
both the 2' radius SAX WFC error circle (BeppoSAX MAIL 99/2)
as well as the 1.5' MECS error circle (BeppoSAX MAIL 99/3),
and contains the optical transient (Bloom et al., GCN 206).
An image may be found at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990123/.
Considerable reduction of the annulus width is possible.
This report was delayed due to the fact that Ulysses data
are not processed and distributed over the weekend.
