Using the data set from T-240 to T+602 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110625A (trigger #456073)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 12088).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 286.751, 6.755 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 07m 00.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 45' 17.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 5%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a series of peaks starting at ~T-12 sec,
with major peaks at ~T-5, ~T+2, ~T+13 and ~T+18, followed by a long tail
ending at ~T+350 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 44.5 +- 10.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.2 to T+140.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.44 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+13.74 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 49.5 +- 2.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
