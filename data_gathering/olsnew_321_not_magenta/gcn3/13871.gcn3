we observed the position of GRB 121011A (Racusin et al., GCN 13845) with 
the Interferometer of the Plateau de Bure on 2012-10-11, starting at 
15:30 UT for 1.46 hours, at frequency 130 GHz. The observing conditions 
were good, with a stable atmosphere (phase rms below 35 degrees), 
Tsys~200 and water vapor about 6 mm.

No afterglow has been detected, with an upper limit of 214 micro Jy.

Given the radio non detection (van der Horst, GCN 13868) and the 
faintness of this object as seen in X-ray (Burrows et al., GCN 13857), 
no further observations are planned.

We thank the technical staff of IRAM for fast support of the trigger.
