K.L. Page (U. Leicester) & C.B. Markwardt (GSFC/UMD) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed the first orbit of data (930 seconds in Photon Counting
mode) for GRB 070531 (trigger number 280958) and find an uncatalogued,
fading X-ray source at a position of RA, Dec 6.73989, 74.3131, which is

RA(J2000)  =  00 26 57.57
Dec(J2000) = +74 18 47.0

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This is 69 
arcsec from the on-board BAT position (GCN Circ. 6475, Markwardt et al.), 
within the BAT error circle.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
