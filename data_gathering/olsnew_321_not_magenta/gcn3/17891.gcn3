report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:42:15.61  UT, on 2015 May 30, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150530A
(trigger 454678938 / 150530488) which was also detected
by Swift (Starling  et al. 2015, GCN 17888). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position. The angle from the
Fermi LAT boresight is about 46 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two peaks with a duration (T90) of
7 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.6 s to
T0+6.7 s is well fit by a BAND function with Epeak = 126 +/- 14 keV,
alpha = -0.8 +/- 0.1, and beta = -2.4 +/- 0.2.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.1 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+2.8 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 6.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
