K.L. Page (U. Leicester) & C.B. Markwardt (CRESST/GSFC/UMD) report on 
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT performed a Target of Opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL 
GRB 081003B (Gotz et al., GCN Circ. 8317), starting ~29 ks after the 
trigger. No source is detected within or near to the INTEGRAL error circle 
during a 3.6 ks Photon Counting mode observation. The 3-sigma upper limit 
on the count rate is 0.002 count s^-1, corresponding to an approximate 
observed 0.3-10 keV flux of 1x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (using a standard 
counts to flux conversion factor).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
