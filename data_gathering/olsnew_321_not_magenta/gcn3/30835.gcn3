the AGILE Team:

The AGILE satellite clearly detected the two bright bursts from the
SGR1935+2154, at T1 = 2021-09-10 00:45:47 s (UTC), reported by Konus-Wind
(GCN #30804), Fermi GBM (GCN #30806), and GECAM (GCN #30822), and at T2 =
2021-09-12 20:16:10 s (UTC), reported by Fermi GBM (GCN #30831).

The bursts are clearly visible in the AGILE scientific ratemeters of the
SuperAGILE (SA; 20-60 keV) and AntiCoincidence (AC; 50-200 keV) detectors.

The first event lasted about 2 s and it released a total number of 560
counts in the SA detector (above a background rate of 65 Hz), and 8730
counts in the AC detector (above a background rate of 3450 Hz). The AGILE
ratemeter light curves can be found at
http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/burst210910_AGILE_RM.png . At T1, the
SGR1935+2154 was 150 deg off-axis for AGILE.

The second event lasted 2 s and it released a total number of 620 counts in
the SA detector (above a background rate of 100 Hz), and 8170 counts in the
AC detector (above a background rate of 3500 Hz). The AGILE ratemeter light
curves can be found at
http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/burst210912_AGILE_RM.png . At T2, the
SGR1935+2154 was 37 deg off-axis for AGILE.

Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
