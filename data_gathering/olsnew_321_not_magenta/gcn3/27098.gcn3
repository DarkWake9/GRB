Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200215A (trigger #956639)
(Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 27079).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 34.100, 12.775 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 16m 24.1s
   Dec(J2000) = +12d 46' 31.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.


The mask-weighted light curve shows a single symmetrical peak from roughly

-10 sec to +6 sec, peaking at T+0 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 11.7 +- 2.2 sec

(estimated error including systematics).


The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.97 to T+5.37 sec is best fit by a simple

power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is

1.41 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
