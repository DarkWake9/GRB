D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 200 s with a multi-peaked structure has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 20:12:43  UT of February 20, 2019.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 242.4512 deg
DEC.= -21.1314 deg

with an uncertainty of  2.0   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.2  counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration  time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 3.6e-6
erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
