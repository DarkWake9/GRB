During a MASTER-net  inspect of LIGO/Virgo S191216ap (Lipunov et al., GCN 
26457)   MASTER-Amur robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State Pedagogical 
University) started inspect of the LIGO/Virgo S191216ap  IceCube  neutrino 
counterpart  errorbox (GCN 26460,26463)   41727 sec after trigger time at 
2019-12-17 09:17:25 UT, with upper limit up to  17.4 mag. Observations 
started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith distance = 50 deg. 
The sun  altitude  is -16.2 deg.

MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope  located in Russia (Applied Physics 
Institute, Irkutsk State University) started inspect of the LIGO/Virgo 
S191216ap  IceCube  neutrino counterpart   errorbox  44823 sec after 
trigger time at 2019-12-17 10:09:01 UT, with upper limit up to  19.0 mag. 
Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith 
distance = 50 deg. The sun  altitude  is -10.0 deg.

MASTER OF J212806.11+023221.9s - Optical Flare known CV.

MASTER-Tunka auto-detection system ( Lipunov et al., "MASTER Global 
Robotic Net", Advances in Astronomy, 2010, 30L )
  discovered OF at  (RA, Dec) = 21h 28m 06.11s +02d 32m 21.9s on 
2019-12-17.43984 UT.

This flash falls off with the position of the famous CV CSS 151110: 212806 
+ 023221 (U Gem type).

The OT magnitude in 'C' filter is 17.0m
(mlim18.3=).

The OT is seen in 2 images. There is no minor planet at this place.

We have reference image on 2010-08-29.64730 UT with  unfiltered mlim= 
18.8m.

Spectral observations are required.


Real time updated cover map and OT discovered available here:
