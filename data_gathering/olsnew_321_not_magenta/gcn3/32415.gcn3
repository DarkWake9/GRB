The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:05:31 UT on 19 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220719A (trigger 679932336.585264 / 220719587).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 258.6, Dec = -68.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 14m, -68d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 169.0 degrees.
