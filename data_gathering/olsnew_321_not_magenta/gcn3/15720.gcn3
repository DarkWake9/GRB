SUBJECT: GRB 140110A: Reported UVOT OT not GRB afterglow

J. A. Kennea and M. M. Chester (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team:

The UVOT detected optical transient reported by Xu (GCN 15719) is not 
related to GRB 140110A (Bissaldi et al., GCN 15714). The transient appears 
at different locations in two observations taken by UVOT as part of the 
Swift target-of-opportunity observations of GRB 140110A (Evans, GCN 
15715). We believe that this transient is most likely an optical artifact.
