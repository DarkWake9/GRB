The values for magnitude UVOT's white filter were listed as 99th magnitude
in the previous circular and have been corrected here.

GRB 190109A: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

K. K. Simpson (PSU) and J. D. Gropp (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 190109A
181 s after the BAT trigger (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 23642).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(Osborne et al. GCN Circ. 23644)
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
