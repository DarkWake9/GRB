TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5041
SUBJECT: GRB 060501: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    06/05/01 09:19:00 GMT
FROM:    Eli Rykoff at U of Michigan/ROTSE  <erykoff@umich.edu>

E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), S.A. Yost (U 
Mich), R. Quimby (U Texas), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 
060501 (Swift trigger 208050, GCN 5040), producing usable images 
beginning 92 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the 
first image at 08:22:4.6 UT, 426 s after the burst, under fair 
conditions with high airmass. We took 7 20-s exposures before bad 
weather forced the system to close. These unfiltered images are 
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma error circle. Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging 
from 16.3-16.4; we set the following specific limits.

  start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
