In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S191215w at T0 = 2019-12-15
22:30:52.333 (UT), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter
(MCAL) triggered data found no event  candidates within a time interval
covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 60% of the S191215w 90% c.l. localization region was
accessible to the AGILE MCAL.Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained
for a 1 s integration time at different celestial positions within the
accessible S191215w localization region, from a minimum of 1.2E-06 erg
cm^-2 to a maximum of 1.6E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming as spectral model a
single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the
energy range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
