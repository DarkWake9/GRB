We have observed the field of GRB 070521 (GCN 6431) with
the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started from 11:47:35 UT
on May 21(4.9 h after the trigger).
After co-adding a set of 32 images (11:47:35 - 12:46:04 UT) of 30 sec 
exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 17.8mag.
