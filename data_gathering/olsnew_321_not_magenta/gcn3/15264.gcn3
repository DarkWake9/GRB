FROM:    Ashley Zauderer at CfA  <bevinashley@gmail.com>

A. Zauderer, E. Berger (Harvard), and G. Petitpas (SMA) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of GRB 130925A (Lien et al., GCN 15246) beginning
2013 Sep 26.31 UT
(dt = 1.1 d) with the SMA at a mean frequency of 230 GHz.  We find no
significant radio emission
at the position of the enhanced Swift-XRT position (Evans et al., GCN
15250) to a 3-sigma limit of 1.89 mJy.
Observations are ongoing.

We thank the SMA staff for prompt execution of these observations."
