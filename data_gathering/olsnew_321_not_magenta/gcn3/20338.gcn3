A. Cholden-Brown (PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 161224A, from 28.3 ks to
52.2 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are entirely in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. A fading X-ray source is found in the BAT error
region. Using 617 s of PC mode data and 1 UVOT image, we find an
enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT
field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 204.81579, -18.02909
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 13h 39m 15.79s
Dec(J2000): -18d 01' 44.7"

with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=2.8 (+0.8, -2.1).

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.8, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 8.4 x 10^-4 count s^-1
