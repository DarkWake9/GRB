and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

A gamma ray burst lasting about 3 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 13:32:23  UT of February 8, 2021.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.=  260.1976  deg
DEC.=  -12.6667 deg
with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 0.9  counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 2e-7  erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
