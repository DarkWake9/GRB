P.A.Milne (Steward Obs), G.G. Williams (MMTO),
on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team reports:
 
We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 060206 (GCN 4682, GCN 4683) using
the 60cm Super-LOTIS telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona. Imaging began at
08:59:30 UT, 4.2 hours after the burst, and consisted of 20 one-minute
exposures in both the R and V filters. The optical counterpart was
detected at the following magnitudes:
 
UT Start    UT End    FILTER    Magnitude
08:59:30   09:25:50     R       17.87 +/- 0.12
09:27:00   09:52:20     V       18.37 +/- 0.22
 
Magnitudes are based upon comparison with 9 & 5 stars, respectively,
from the Nomad-1 catalog, accessed through the USNO catalog service.
