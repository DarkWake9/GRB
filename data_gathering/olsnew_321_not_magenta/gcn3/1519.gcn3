Mike Gladders (Carnegie Observatories) and Pat Hall (Princeton/Catolica):

On the basis of previous experience with the public release of GRB
data taken by us at LCO (GCN #1209), we have decided to release the
Baade 6.5m (Magellan I) data taken of GRB 020813 on the nights of
August 13 and 14 UT for general use by the community. We anticipate
that this high-quality data, which provides several hours of early
photometry of the burst under sub 0".5 seeing conditions, will be of
use to a number of researchers. As before, we anticipate that
appropriate collaboration(s) will evolve as circumstances
dictate. Meanwhile, the pre-processed data, including a README file
detailing observing conditions and preliminary zeropoints for the
images, can be downloaded by anonymous ftp from:

ftp.ociw.edu

pub/gladders/GRB/GRB020813

Raw science frames, as well as extensive calibration data can be
provided if necessary; please contact Mike Gladders
(gladders@ociw.edu) to arrange for this.
