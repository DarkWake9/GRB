report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:33:46.807 UT on 19 April 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 170419B (trigger 514330431 / 170419898).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Cholden-Brown et al., GCN 21016). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 41 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 24 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.5 s to T0+5.1 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 116 +/- 19 keV,
alpha = -0.03 +/- 0.29, and beta = -2.07 +/- 0.15.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.4 +/- 0.2)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.8 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
