H. Swan (U Mich), I. Smith (Rice), C. Akerlof (U Mich), and M.  
Skinner (Boeing) report on behalf of the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS telescope, located at the  
Maui Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, observed the fading
counterpart to GRB070529 (Swift trigger 280706 (GCN 6466)). The  
images are unfiltered 10s exposures which started less than 30
minutes after the trigger and ended ~ 2 hours later.

We detect the OT first identified by S. T. Holland et al (GCN 6466).  
A preliminary analysis gives a magnitude of approximately 19.41
+/-0.04 at 13:20:35 UT. We calibrated the OT to the USNO-B1.0 R2 band  
magnitude of the nearby 17.35 mag star located at (J2000) RA =
283.73991, DEC = 20.657206. We find that the ABC data fades as a  
power law decay with  index  ~-1.1.

Further analysis is in progress.
