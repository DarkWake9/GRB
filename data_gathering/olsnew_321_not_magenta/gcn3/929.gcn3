"Photometry of the object pointed out by us in GCN 924: 
start time Jan 27.0451;  R = 21.3 +- 0.2 ; exp. time 30 min 
start time Jan 27.0687;  R = 21.3 +- 0.4 ; exp. time 20 min 
Calibration star: USNO U350_08031605. 
The hypotized short term variability (GCN 924) is excluded. 
Although these values are well above the detection limit of DSSII-red, 
the object is not present on it. This behaviour is consistent with a 
long term, large amplitude variable or an  eclipsing binary.
Our two CCD images can be retrieved by secure shell ftp at the address:
