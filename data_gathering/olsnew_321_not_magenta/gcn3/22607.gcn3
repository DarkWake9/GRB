The long-duration, hard-spectrum, bright GRB 180404C triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 21:42:08.587 UTC on 4 April 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.  This GRB is also clearly
seen by the publicly available INTEGRAL SPI-ACS light curve.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts at T+1.7 sec, peaks at
T+5.5 sec and ends at T+34.1 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations measured
by the SGM data are 25.4 +- 3.1 sec and 9.5 +- 1.4 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
CGBM HV was turned off at ~T+65 sec due to entering the radiation belts, so
no CGBM data are available from that time until ~T+1000 sec.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
