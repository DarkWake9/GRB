Optical Observations of GRB 980425

J.S. Bloom, S.R. Kulkarni, S.G. Djorgovski (Caltech), P. McCarthy
(OCIW) and D.Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the Caltech-OCIW GRB
effort: "Kaspar von Braun (U.  Mich) imaged the field of the X-ray
source reported in IAUC 6884 (Soffitta et al.) on the 40-inch at Las
Campanas Observatory in Chile.  Two sets of images were obtained in the
R band at April 27.4 UT and April 28.4 UT.  We scrutinized the images
in the vicinity of the two BeppoSAX NFI sources reported by L. Piro and
Pian et al. (GCN #61).  In the 1-arcmin error circle of  the fading
X-ray source SAXJ1935.3-5252 we found no source with variability
greater than 0.2 mag for R < 21 mag.

We thank Kaspar von Braun and Mario Mateo for their help on these
observations. "
