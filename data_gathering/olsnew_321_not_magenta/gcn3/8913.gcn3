S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, P.
Oleynik, M. Ulanov and T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,
report:

Two very bright SGR bursts triggered Konus-Wind
at 2009-02-21 T0=55653.101 s UT (15:27:33.101) and 2009-02-22 
T0=1694.689 s UT (00:28:14.689). The first was also detected by 
Fermi/GBM (trigger 256922856). The GBM location is consistent with the 
AXP/SGR 1E1547.0-5408 position. The Konus ecliptic latitude response 
indicates that the source of these bursts is in the south ecliptic 
hemisphere. So, we believe they originated from AXP/SGR 1E1547.0-5408.

Preliminary estimations yields for the first burst
a fluence of ~1.6x10^-5 erg/cm2, a peak flux on 2ms time scale of 
~2.3x10^-4 erg/cm2/s (both in the 20-300 keV), and Ep ~50 keV for the 
time-integrated spectrum,
and for the second burst a fluence of 4.3x10^-6 erg/cm2, a peak flux on 
2ms time scale of ~1.4x10^-4 erg/cm2/s (both in the 20-300 keV), and Ep 
~40 keV for the time-integrated spectrum.

Since January 29 (Golenetskii et al., 8863) seven bright bursts from the 
AXP/SGR 1E1547.0-5408 have triggered Konus-Wind:
