CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al,
2020, arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 210709A, which
was also detected by Fermi-GBM (GCN 30427).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The
light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-07-09 04:49:04.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with
the burst is 201 (+40, -42) cts/s above the background in the combined
data of four quadrants, with a total of 909 (+221, -239) cts. The local
mean background count rate was 386 (+4, -4) cts/s. Using cumulative
rates, we measure a T90 of 14 (+4, -4) s. 

It was also detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the
100-500 keV energy range. 

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb [1]. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC,
and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and
facilitated the project.
