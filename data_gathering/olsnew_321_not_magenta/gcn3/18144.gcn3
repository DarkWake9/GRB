We observed the field of GRB 150817A (V. D'Elia, et al., GCN 18143) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/08 17.14 to 2015/08 17.16 UTC (1.29 to 1.70 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We find an uncatalogued source within the Swift-XRT error circle at RA, Dec = 16:38:31.98, -12:3:11.5 (J2000, +/-0.5").  In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following detections and upper limit (3-sigma):

   r = 21.50 +/- 0.20
   i = 21.26 +/- 0.10
   z > 17.83

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Further observations are planned.
