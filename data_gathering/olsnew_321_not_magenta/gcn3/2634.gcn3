(ISDC) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

A 50 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on July 30 at  02:11:55 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band (IBAS Alert # 1888)
Its coordinates (J2000)  are:

R.A.  15h 53m 16s
Dec. -56deg 27' 03''

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin  (90% c.l. radius)

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 0.4
photons/cmsq/s (4E-8 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).
