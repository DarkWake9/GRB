report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:46:10.09  UT on the 10th of August 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 140810A
(trigger 429389173 / 140810782), which was also detected by the LAT
(Bissaldi et al. 2014, GCN 16678). The trigger resulted in an
Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was accepted. The GBM
on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 122 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks with a duration (T90)
of about 82 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from
T0-3.58 s to T0+107.01 s is well fit by a power law function with an
exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.01 +/- 0.01
and the cutoff energy, parameterised as Epeak, is 302 +/- 7 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(110.42 +/- 0.07)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux
measured from T0+6.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band, is
35.98+/-0.65 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
