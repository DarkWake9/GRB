Z.Y. Lin, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata(RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou (THCA) on behalf of EAFON report:

"We have imaged the GRB 050713A afterglow position (Malesani et al.;
Hearity et al.; Guziy et al.; and Monfardini et al.) at 10.3 hours
after the burst using Lulin 1-m telescope. The afterglow was not
detected in our R band co-add image (300s x 5 frames). Compare with
USNOB1.0 stars, we estimate the afterglow would be fainter than 22.4
mag during our observations.

This message may be cited."
