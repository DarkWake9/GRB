S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), report on behalf of the Swift Team:

This is a corection to the recent GCN Circ 19874 (Barthelmy et al).  The location given was incorrect.
The proper on-board determined location is 270.760 {+18h 03m 02s}, -20.248 {-20d 14' 53"} (J2000).
However, we repeat that this trigger (710022) is very likley noise, and that there will be
a final determination when the full data set is downlinked.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
