Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT trigger 645340 (Marshall et al., GCN Circ. 17950).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 244.988, -15.638 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  16h 19m 57.1s
  Dec(J2000) = -15d 38' 15.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
This position is consistent with the location of Sco X-1 (with separation
of 0.51 arcmin).

The BAT spectrum of this source is quite soft, which is consistent with
the spectral feature of Sco X-1 (Baumgartner et al. 2013;
http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/bs70mon/SWIFT_J1620.1-1539)

Therefore, we confirm that BAT trigger 645340 (GCN #17950)
was due to Sco X-1 and not to a new source.
