report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We continue observations of the afterglow  (Singer et al., GCN 14967) of GRB 
130702A  (Cheung  et al., GCN 14971; Collazzi  et al., GCN  14972) with 
AZT-22 telescope of Maidanak observatory.  A preliminary photometry of 
combined images is based on two SDSS stars suggested by Schulze et al. (GCN 
14978) and used in our previous observations (Pozanenko et al, GCN 14988)

The light curve is based on the photometry of this CGN circular and our 
previous observations (Pozanenko et al, GCN 14988)  and can be found at 
http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB130702A/GRB130702A_MAO_R_lc.png

One can see flattening of the lc after 4 days (initially reported by Butler 
et al., GCN 14993)  and possible re-brightening on 6.6 days which can 
confirm re-brightening of the afterglow (Schulze et al., GCN 14994) and 
emerging supernova.
