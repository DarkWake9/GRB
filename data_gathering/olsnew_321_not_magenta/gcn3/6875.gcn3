Using the data set from T0 to T+13 sec (which covers only one of the
minor peaks in the burst), we report further analysis of
BAT GRB 071006 (trigger #293250) (Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 6858).  
The best BAT position is RA, Dec = 335.294 -23.147 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 21m 10.4s
   Dec(J2000) = -23d 08' 47"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 6%.
 
We do not have a mask-weighted light curve for this event. The raw
light curve based on the whole detector rate shows 3 peaks of 
increasing amplitude, the two minor peaks at T-2 and T+10 sec, and the 
main peak at T+32 sec. The two smaller peaks are each about 6 seconds 
long and the larger about 30 seconds long. All the peaks are roughly 
symmetric. T90 is 50 +- 10 seconds (estimated error including 
systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0 to T+13 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.75 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. 

The 1-sec peak photon flux occurs where no event data is available.
By comparing the portions of the raw light curve and the mask-weighted
light curve that do overlap, we extrapolate a peak flux of 
13 +- 3 ph/cm2/sec in the 15-150 keV band.  Similarly, we extrapolate a 
total fluence of  1.0 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
