Notes:

1. Confirmed event; triangulation annulus agrees with the
position of SGR1900+14.  Earth crossing time given.

2. Unconfirmed event for the moment.  Time is the time at
Ulysses.  To get the Earth crossing time for SGR1900+14, 
subtract ~248 s.

Prior to this episode, the last bursts from this source
appear to have been on November 4.
