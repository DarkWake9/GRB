G.Bourban, F.Carrier, G.Burki, T.Courvoisier and L.Weber (Geneva
Observatory) report:

We have carried out observations of the field of HETE GRB 030115(=H2533)
using the C2 CCD Camera (12'x 12') on the Swiss 1.2-meter telescope
at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile), beginning at 05:31 UT 
on 2003 January 15.  We have obtained eight images in band V, with
exposure time of 30, 90, 120 and 400sec.  We find no new object to the 
limit V < 19 of the DSS in the HETE SXC error circle for the burst,
confirming the result reported in GCN Circulars 1806 (Flaccomio et al.)
and 1808 (Blake et al.).

This messages may be cited.

[GCN OPS NOTE:  This circular was received at 20:42 UT 15 Jan 2003,
but was delayed in distribution due to a variation in the accountname.]
