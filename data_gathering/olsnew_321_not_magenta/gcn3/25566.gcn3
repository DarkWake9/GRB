The H.E.S.S. array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes was used to carry out follow-up observations of the afterglow of GRB 190829A (Dichiara et al., GCN 25552). At a redshift of z = 0.0785 +/- 0.005 (A.F. Valeev et al., GCN 25565) this is one of the nearest GRBs detected to date. H.E.S.S. Observations started July 30 at 00:16 UTC (i.e. T0 + 4h20), lasted until 3h50 UTC and were taken under good conditions. A preliminary onsite analysis of the obtained data shows a >5sigma gamma-ray excess compatible with the direction of GRB190829A. Further analyses of the data are on-going and further H.E.S.S. observations are planned. We strongly encourage follow-up at all wavelengths.

H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for the detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources and is located in the Khomas Highlands in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers from Armenia, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia.
