The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:01:45 UT on 26 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210826A (trigger 651654110.161386 / 210826293).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 64.6, Dec = -77.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 18m, -77d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 48.0 degrees.
