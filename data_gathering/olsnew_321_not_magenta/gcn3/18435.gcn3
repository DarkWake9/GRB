report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 151021A (Melandri et al., GCN 18425)
in Ks-band with a wide-field near infrared imager at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan).  The imager has effective
aperture of 0.91 m.

Observations started from 10:42 UT on 21th October, 9.2h after
the BAT trigger, to 11:11 UT. The total exposure of 11.7 min
was successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within
the enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN 18428) down
to limiting magnitude of Ks=14.5 (Vega, S/N=10). The photometric
calibration was made against 2MASS field stars.
