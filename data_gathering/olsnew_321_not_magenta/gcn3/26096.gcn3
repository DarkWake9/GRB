B. Biltzinger, J. Greiner (both MPE Garching) report:

The BALROG localization of GRB 191027A (Fermi Trigger 593882352 / GRB 191027638)  
(https://grb.mpe.mpg.de/grb/GRB191027638/?data_version=0)
published in Biltzinger et al. 2019 (GCN Circ. 26079) was sent by mistake, as
it suffered an obvious problem in the automatic background fit (e.g. n1, n5).
Corrected files have now been uploaded on 
https://grb.mpe.mpg.de/grb/GRB191027638/?data_version=zzz_bkg_corrected

The history of the original fits will remain on the page.
  
We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
