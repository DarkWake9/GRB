A.Tiengo, S.Mereghetti, A.De Luca (IASF-Milano) report:

A preliminary analysis of the XMM-Newton TOO observation (Gonzalez-Riestra
and Rodriguez-Pascual GCN 2533) of the INTEGRAL GRB 040223 (Gotz et al.
GCN 2525) gives the following results for the X-ray afterglow:

The average spectrum is well fit by a steep power law with photon index
2.8+/-0.2, absorption (1.75+/-0.2)x10^22 cm^-2, and observed flux
2.6x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 keV).

The source is fading, with a temporal decay well described by a power law
with index (1.0+/-0.2).

The ~40 ksec long XMM-Newton observation started at 18:54 UT of February
23, 2004.
