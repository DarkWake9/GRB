MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) located in 
Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB141026A 22 sec after notice time and 99 sec 
after trigger time at 2014-10-26 02:38:31 UT in two polarizations. On our first 
single and coadd images we haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT 
error-box (Hagen et. al. GCN 16950). The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 
16.5 on single (20s exposure) and 17.5 on coadd image (from first 3 images with 
total exposure 80 sec). The message may be cited.

The publication delay was due to time zone changes during this night.
