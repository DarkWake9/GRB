TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  909
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB010103

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,
T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams,
and E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the KONUS-WIND GRB team, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, and KONUS-WIND observed this GRB at 58275 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   10.
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  7.8E-07 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  5.7E-07 erg/cm2 s over  .25 seconds


We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with approximate area 375.
sq. arcmin. whose coordinates are:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:   8 h  3 m 46.52 s    -16 o  7 '  24.09 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  8 h  3 m 26.07 s    -16 o  1 '  26.37 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  8 h  5 m 35.32 s    -16 o  1 '    .33 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  8 h  1 m 58.85 s    -16 o 13 '  44.83 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  8 h  4 m  7.00 s    -16 o 13 '  21.71 " 

This error box may be improved.
