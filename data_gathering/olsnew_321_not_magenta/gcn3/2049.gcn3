(Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We are conducting time-resolved photometry of GRB 030329 (HETE 
trigger #2652, Ricker et al., GCN 1997) with the TEK 1K CCD mounted 
on the 1-meter telescope of Wise Observatory, Israel.

During 3 hours of observations, starting at March 31 17:00 UT, the OT is 
constant (to within 0.1 mag), with a mean magnitude of approximately 
R=16.8, consistent with the findings of Zeh et al (GCN 2048).
