D. Xu, B.Y. Yu, Z.P. Zhu (NAOC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 190829A (Dichiara et al., GCN 25552) using 
the Half Meter Telescope (HMT-0.5m) located at Dabancheng, Xinjiang, 
China. Observations started at 20:49:03 UT on 2019-08-29 (i.e., 52.3 min 
after the burst), and a series of 150s unfiltered frames and photometry 
is still ongoing.

We detected an uncatalogued and evolving optical source at coordinates

R.A. (J2000) = 2:58:10.580
Dec. (J2000) = -8:57:29.82

with an uncertainty of ~0.3 arcsec, fully consistent with the XRT error 
circle (Dichiara et al., GCN 25552). Preliminary analysis gives 
m(r)~16.0 mag for the source in our first image. We thus conclude that 
this source is the optical counterpart of the bust at z=0.079.
