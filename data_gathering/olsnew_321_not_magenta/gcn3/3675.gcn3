P. D'Avanzo (INAF/OABr), D. Malesani (SISSA), G. Tagliaferri (INAF/OABr), G. Chincarini (Univ. 
Milano-Bicocca) and L. Stella (INAF/OAR), on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration, report:

Using the FORS1 instrument at the ESO VLT, we obtained a spectrum of the 
object indicated by Antonelli et al. (GCN 3666), also named as object B 
by Bloom et al. (GCN 3672). This object is liying close to the XRT 
errorbox center (Covino et al., GCN 3665; Romano et al., GCN 3669). 
Observations were obtained on 2005, July 24, starting at 23:16:00 
UT, under good seeing conditions. We used the grism 300V with a slit of 
1.0 arcsec. The integration time was 900 s.


The object is identified with a star trough Ca, CN, G-band, Hbeta, Na 
and Halpha faint absorption lines. It has therefore no likely 
association with GRB 050724.

We thank the excellent work by the ESO staff in performing these 
observations.
