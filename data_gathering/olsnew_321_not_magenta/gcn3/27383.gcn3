report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"At 01:41:36.62 UT on 13 March 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)

triggered and located GRB 200313A (trigger 605756501 / 200313071).


The location for this GRB was reported in the Fermi GBM Final Real-time

Localization GCN (GCN 27374).


The GBM light curve shows a single broad peak

with a duration (T90) of about 13.6 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+22.5 s is

best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 279 +/- 10 keV,

alpha = -0.64 +/- 0.02, and beta = -1.84 +/- 0.02.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is

(7.37 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured

starting from T0+2.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band

is 57.0 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;

final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
