report:

"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope robotically followed up GRB 130606A
(SWIFT trigger 557589; Ukwatta et al., GCN 14781) 38.52 min after the 
GRB trigger time.
We detect a fading source in i' and z' bands consistent with the 
position reported by Xu et al. (GCN 14783) with magnitudes

Filter        Magnitude                t since trigger (min)
i'            18.60 +/- 0.02            45.02
i'            18.67 +/- 0.02            55.48
i'            18.89 +/- 0.03             83.00

z'            16.65 +/- 0.02                47.74
z'            16.80 +/- 0.03                61.47

Magnitudes are calibrate against SDSS catalogued field stars.
Observations and analysis are ongoing.
