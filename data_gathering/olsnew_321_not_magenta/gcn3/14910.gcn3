S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J.R. Cummings (GSFC/UMBC) and C.B. Markwardt (GSFC)
on behalf of the Swift Team report:
 
Using the data set from T-116 to T+49 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report on further analysis of BAT trigger #557910 that the trigger
is not due to anything astrophysical.  The trigger was caused
by incorrect spacecraft attitude information applied to a known source.
