The Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen 
Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO) observed the field of GRB 
220118A 11 s after receipt an automated GCN / BAT position alert, 
observing in Sloan i' band, with the Burst Simultaneous Three-Channel 
Imager (BSTI; Grossan, Kumar & Smoot 2019, JHEA, 32, 14).

We started observations at 18:21:08 UT on 2022-01-18, 30 s after the BAT 
trigger. Observations were made in cloudy conditions starting at about 
25 deg. target altitude. No source consistent with the XRT (M.R. Goad et 
al., GCN Circ. 31495) was detected.  We report the following results:

start time    t-t0(s)  end time        ULi'       exposure_time (s)
------------    --------  ------------          ------ --------------------
18:21:08     30     18:22:08          15.3           60
18:22:32     114   18:25:02          16.0         150
18:25:02     264   18:27:32          16.4         150
18:27:32     414   18:30:02          17.2         150
18:30:02     564   18:32:32          17.4         150

start time is in UT. t-t0(s) gives the time since trigger, in seconds. 
UL i', gives the 5 sigma upper limit sensitivity in magnitudes, for 
images co-added to the given exposure time. The first row in the table 
corresponds to co-adds of an initial short exposure image sequence of 
7.5 s. The following rows correspond to co-adds from a continuing series 
of 15 s exposures.  Calibration was done with the 4 bright Pan-STARRS 
catalog stars on our images.

We caution the reader that these are preliminary results, without color 
or other corrections. Please also note that times are approximate.
