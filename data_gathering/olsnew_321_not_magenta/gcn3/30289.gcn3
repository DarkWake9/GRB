We observed the NIR afterglow of GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ. 30261) with the Italian 3.6m TNG 
telescope equipped with the near-infrared camera NICS. A series of images were obtained with the J and K filters 
on 2021-06-21 from 01:27:06 UT to 02:49:36 UT (i.e. at a mid time of about 1.09 days after the burst). 

With preliminary photometry we derive the following magnitudes:

J = 17.90  +/- 0.05 
K = 16.43  +/- 0.11 
(Vega; calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).
