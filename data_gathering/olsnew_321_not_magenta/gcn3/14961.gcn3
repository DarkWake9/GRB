Kennea (PSU) and N.P.M. Kuin report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.6 ks of XRT data for GRB 130701A (Kuin  et al. GCN
Circ. 14953),  from 91 s to 36.5 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 214 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Beardmore et al. (GCN. Circ 14955).

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=1.02 (+0.03, -0.06), followed by a break at T+2249 s to
an alpha of 1.38 (+0.10, -0.08).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.19 (+/-0.10). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.29 (+0.22, -0.20) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 6.9 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.97 (+0.16, -0.15)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.3 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.8 x 10^-11 (5.0 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.3 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 6.9 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.8 sigma
Photon index:	     1.97 (+0.16, -0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.38, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 7.5 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.8 x
10^-13 (3.8 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
