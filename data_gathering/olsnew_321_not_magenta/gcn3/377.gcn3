"We have observed the error box of GRB990705 (BeppoSAX mail # 99/16 and
99/17) at the ESO NTT with SOFI in H filter for 20 minutes starting on 
July 5.94 UT and for 10 minutes starting on July 6.95 UT. An object of 
H = 16.7 +- 0.1 is detected in the first night at RA = 05 09 55.4, Dec
= -72 08 01 (astrometric uncertainty of 1".5), and not in the second  
night, with a 3-sigma upper limit of H >~ 19.  The position of the  
transient is consistent with that of the X-ray transient detected with
the SAX NFIs (Gandolfi, GCN 373).  We propose that the transient source
is the infrared counterpart to GRB 990705.  Assuming a power-law
temporal fading, the measured magnitude and upper limit would imply
that the decay index is < -1.4.

In a 10-minutes exposure taken at the VLT with FORS1 in the V filter on
July 6.40 UT in very bad seeing conditions (~2".5) the source is
detected at 3-sigma confidence level with V ~22.5, linked to the
standard sequence PG 2331+055 (Landolt 1992, AJ 104, 340).

A 7.5-min exposure with the ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla on July 6.44
UT yields no detection, to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of B ~22,
linked to the USNO-A1.0 star at RA = 05 09 42.59, Dec = -72 07 41.2
(J2000) which has B = 19.1."
