A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C. 
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration very intense GRB 140320D has been observed by 
Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Swift (BAT), and MESSENGER (GRNS), so 
far, at about 73297 s UT (20:21:37). The burst was outside the coded
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
   ---------------------------------------------
     RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
    ---------------------------------------------
    Center:
      87.893 (05h 51m 34s) +85.429 (+85d 25' 46")
    Corners:
      98.997 (06h 35m 59s) +86.721 (+86d 43' 15")
      98.219 (06h 32m 53s) +87.023 (+87d 01' 23")
      81.849 (05h 27m 24s) +84.026 (+84d 01' 35")
      83.033 (05h 32m 08s) +83.741 (+83d 44' 28")
    ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 0.635 sq. deg, and its maximum dimension is 3.474
deg (the minimum one is 0.196 deg).

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
