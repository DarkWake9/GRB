TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1443
SUBJECT: GRB 020531: optical photometry of Chandra sources

Isabel Salamanca, Evert Rol (University of Amsterdam), Nial Tanvir
(University of Hertfordshire), Lex Kaper (UoA), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

We have performed differential photometry of the sources detected by
Chandra  (GCN #1399) in the field of view of GRB 020531
(GCN #1399, #1402). The observations were done with the WFC on the
INT at La Palma. For more details see GCN 1433.

Of the 13 sources detected by Chandra, we detect 5 in both epochs:
cx00, cx15, cx48, cx55, cx56. Four more sources are detected only in
the second epoch: cx05,cx47,cx58 and cx52.  We remark that the source
cx00 is also visible in the DSS.

We have perfomed differential photometry of the first 4 sources by
comparing them with 12 stars in the field. The relative accuracy
attained is 0.01 mag. The absolute photometry was done via the
photometry performed by Henden etal. (GCN #1422). The estimated error
in the zero point is higher, 0.4 mag, due to the fact that the
observations were performed under non-photometric conditions.


Below is a summary of the magnitudes of each object:

Id		V mag
	31 May	   	2 June
=====================================
 5	>24.7		24.5
15 	21.73		21.80
--- ---------------------------------
28	>24.7		>25.2
36	>24.7		>25.2
41	>24.7		>25.2
47	>24.7		23.8
48	23.27		23.20
51	>24.7		>25.2
52	>24.7		24.0
55	23.15		23.19
56	21.71		21.60
58	>24.7		~25.2

The proposed afterglow candidate, cx48 (GCN #1426, #1427 and #1428) is
0.07 +/- 0.01 mag brighter in the second epoch than in the first.
