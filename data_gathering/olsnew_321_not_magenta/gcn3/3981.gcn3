TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3981
SUBJECT: GRB050915: P60 Optical Observations

S. Bradley Cenko (Caltech) and Derek B. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of GRB 050915 (Grupe et al., GCN 3977)
with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations began
approximately 4 minutes after the burst in the Kron R and Gunn i filters.
Inside the XRT error circle (Kennea et al., GCN 3979), we find no source
present.

Using the USNO-B object located at 05:26:48.6, -28:00:48.9 (J2000.0, R2 =
17.90, I2 = 17.88) as a reference, we find the following 3-sigma upper
limits for any point-source in the XRT error circle:


Filter		Int Time (s)	Mean UT		Tb (min)	Mag
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
R		540		11:41		18		> 21.0
i		540		11:43		20		> 20.5
