TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16299
SUBJECT: GRB 140518A: KAIT optical candidate

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to GRB 140518A (Swift trigger 599287;
Melandri et al., GCN 16298) starting at 09:22:16 UT, 270 s after
the burst. Observations were performed with an automatic sequence
in the clear (roughly R), V and I filters, and the exposure time
was 20 s per image. We detect a faint object within XRT error
circle at J2000 coordinates of:

RA =  15:09:00.62
DEC= +42:25:05.9

with uncertainty of about 1". The object was only detected in the
first clear band single image with mag R~18.3, no detection in
following single images. But it is marginally detected in the co-add
of next 5 single images with mag R~19.0. We suggest this to be the
afterglow of the GRB. All mags are calibrated to USNO B1.0 catalog.
