N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan, D. White (U. Warwick),
P. T. O'Brien, K. Wiersema (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of a larger collaboration:

We have initiated a sequence of observations with the
4m ESO VISTA telescope at Cerro Paranal, Chile,
to map most of the region between 4h40m and 6h30m
in RA and -65 degs to -73 degs in dec (total area ~60 sq deg).
We are observing in the Y, J and K bands (30 s integrations in
each), and the observations are expected to take 5 or 6 nights,
depending on weather, beginning on 20th Sept.
