J.A. Kennea (PSU), G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), S. Campana (INAF-OAB),
P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 201015A at 23:43:47.2 UT,
3214.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find a fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 354.32067,
53.41460 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 37m 16.96s
   Dec(J2000) = +53d 24' 52.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 91 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 3.60
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).
