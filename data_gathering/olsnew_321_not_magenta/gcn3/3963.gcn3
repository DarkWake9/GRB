on behalf of the Swift team:


At 16:37:04 UT Swift-BAT triggered incorrectly twice (triggers 154632 
and 154633).  These are not GRBs and are due to temporary loss of lock 
in the star trackers.  We caution that other trigger alerts may occur 
in the next hour and should be assumed to be false unless a Circular is 
sent out announcing their validity.

Trigger 154630, 40 minutes earlier, really is GRB 050911.
