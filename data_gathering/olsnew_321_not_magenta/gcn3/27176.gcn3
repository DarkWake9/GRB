TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  27176
SUBJECT: GRB 200224A: BOOTES-1 and 1.5m OSN optical observations
DATE:    20/02/24 06:37:24 GMT

A. Sota, E. Fernandez-Garcia, Y.-D. Hu and A. J. Castro-Tirado 
(IAA-CSIC), A. Castellon, I. Carrasco-Garcia and C. Perez del Pulgar 
(UMA), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the detection of GRB 200224A by Swift (Ukwatta  et al., GCNC 
27173), the 0.3cm robotic telescope at the BOOTES-1 astronomical station 
at INTA-CEDEA in Huelva (Spain) started gathering images at 03:26:27 UT, 
40s after the alert and 118s after the onset of the burst. No optical 
transient is detected in the single images with a limiting magnitude of 
14 (consistent with the MASTER upper limit, Lipunov et al., GCNC 27172). 
Further data reduction is ongoing.

Deeper exposures were obtained with the 1.5m telescope at Observatorio 
de Sierra Nevada starting at 05:35 UT (i.e. 2.1 h post burst).  We find 
an optical source consistent with the Swift/XRT position,  at 
coordinates (RA & Dec, J2000)  = 16:35:04.11 +41:36:42 (+/- 1”). The 
preliminary magnitude is R = 22. Further observations are planned to 
confirm whether this is the optical afterglow to GRB 200224A.

This message can be quoted.

which were all labeled A because of the sequence assigner being offline.  
This circular was correctly labelled A.]
