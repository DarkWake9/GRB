report:

The HETE FREGATE, WXM, and SXC instruments detected GRB 050509c at 
22:45:54 UT (81953.95 SOD) on 9 May 2005.  This was a weak burst
consisting of a single pulse ~25 s long, with almost no emission above
18 keV in the WXM.

The WXM flight localization can be expressed as a circle of radius 14
arcminutes (90% confidence) that is centered at 

WXM-Flight:  RA = 12h 52m 39s, Dec =-44d 17' 50" (J2000).  

The first flight localization was distributed in a GCN Notice issued
at 22:46:13 UT, 19 s after the burst trigger.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a refined WXM localization
that was in a GCN Notice issued 10 May 05 at 00:43:29 UT.  This ground
WXM localization can be expressed as a rectangle with corners:

 R.A. = 12 52 15.4 ; Dec. = -44 23 06
 R.A. = 12 54 05.0 ; Dec. = -44 23 46
 R.A. = 12 54 01.7 ; Dec. = -45 10 01
 R.A. = 12 52 11.3 ; Dec. = -45 09 18 (J2000).

The burst was also detected by the SXC Y camera.  Ground analysis of
the SXC data produced a long thin rectangle.  Truncating the rectangle 
by the WXM ground localization results in a rectangle with corners:

 R.A. = 12 54 02.9 ; Dec. = -44 52 23
 R.A. = 12 52 12.7 ; Dec. = -44 51 43
 R.A. = 12 52 13.2 ; Dec. = -44 48 43
 R.A. = 12 54 03.1 ; Dec. = -44 49 23 (J2000).

A preliminary spectral analysis indicates that Epk < 19 keV.  The
preliminary fluences are: S(2-30 keV) = 6E-07 erg cm^-2,
S(30-400) = 3E-07 erg cm^-2.  Therefore GRB 050509c is an X-ray flash.
