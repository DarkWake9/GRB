The short-duration GRB 170708A
(IPN triangulation: Svinkin et al., GCN Circ. 21314;
Insight-HXMT detection: Xiong et al., GCN Circ. 21307)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=3974.665 s UT (01:06:14.665).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with
a total duration of ~0.2 s.
The emission is seen up to ~500 keV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB170708_T03974/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 8.04(-1.2,+1.4)x10^-7 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.014 s,
of 1.48(-0.37,+0.40)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated 3-channel spectrum of the burst,
measured from T0-0.014 s to T0+0.224 s,
can be modelled by an exponentially cut off power law:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -0.94(-0.30,+0.42) and Ep = 269(-75,+147) keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
