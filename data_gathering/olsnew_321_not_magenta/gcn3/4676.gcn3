We report a follow-up Swift XRT observation of the INTEGRAL detected
burst GRB 060204A (Mereghetti et al. GCN 4654). The XRT observation
began at 2006 Feb 5 00:08:01 UT, 11 hrs after the burst. The XRT
observation lasted for 5.2 ksec and we found no source within the
2.5 arcmin INTEGRAL error circle. We place a 3 sigma upper limit on
the flux of the afterglow of 4.1e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10 keV)
assuming a power-law with a photon index of 2 and a Galactic absorption
of 1e21 cm^-2.

The only X-ray source in the XRT field is 1RXS J152756.5-393155.
