report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the field centered on the XRT position of the Swift burst 
GRB 060801 (GCN#5378) using the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz, beginning 
at August 2.00 UT.  We detect no sources within the XRT error circle
and place a 3-sigma limit of 105 uJy.  Further observations are planned.
