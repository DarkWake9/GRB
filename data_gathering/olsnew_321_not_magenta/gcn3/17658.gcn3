Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:52:21.27 UT on 30 March 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 150330A (trigger 449437944 / 150330828).
The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 329.26, DEC = 49.97, with an uncertainty
of 1.00 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 80 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of two main episodes
with a combined duration (T90) of about 153 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.00 s to T0+151.68 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 284 +/- 5 keV,
alpha = -0.91 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.15 +/- 0.02

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.28 +/- 0.01)E-04 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+130.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 59.26 +/- 0.51 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
