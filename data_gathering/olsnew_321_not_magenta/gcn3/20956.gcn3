The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170318A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 20904) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 18.55 and Mar 21.50 
(UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Evans et al., 
GCN 20907), with 3sigma upper limits of 159 uJy and 93 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
