Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140606A (trigger #600951)
(Stroh, et al., GCN Circ. 16353).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 201.799, 37.599 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 27m 11.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +37d 35' 56.5" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 86%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T+0.0,
peaking at ~T+0.1, and ending at ~T+0.3 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
0.34 +- 0.09 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.04 to T+0.35 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.53 +- 0.36.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.1 +- 1.0 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.34 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
