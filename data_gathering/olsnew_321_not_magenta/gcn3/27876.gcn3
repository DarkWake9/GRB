The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:19:49 UT on 1 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200601A (trigger 612670794.995442 / 200601097).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 36.7, Dec = 33.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 26m, 33d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
