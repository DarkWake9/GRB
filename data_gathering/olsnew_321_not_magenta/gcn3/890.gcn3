report:

We have observed the error box of GRB001120 as part
of the monitoring effort by the AAVSO GRB network.
This error box is quite long in RA (30arcmin), and so the
images only cover the central portion of that
box, missing the extreme east and west corners.
There are a few galaxies visible, so the visual extinction
is not large in this high galactic latitude field (bII=-43).
  The limiting magnitude in the table below is based
on the r-magnitude of a set of USNO-A2.0 stars in the field.
Unfiltered observations are listed with a "C" in the
filter column.  The seeing measures are an upper limit
due to undersampling in both datasets.

All objects on the Nov22.036 dataset are
also visible in the scans of the POSS-2 red
plate from the NOFS PMM pixel server.  The Nov22.051 dataset
goes slightly deeper than the POSS-2 plate, and a second CCD epoch
will be necessary to exclude the fainter objects.
