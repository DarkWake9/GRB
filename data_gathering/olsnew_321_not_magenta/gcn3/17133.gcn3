"At 11:17:05.61 UT on the 2nd of December 2014, the
Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located
GRB 141202A (trigger 439211828 / 141202470 ). The
GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is RA = 145.0, Dec =+59.9, with an uncertainty of
3.3 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,statistical only;
there is additionally a systematic error which is currently
estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The GBM location is
consistent with the IPN Triangulation (Golenetskii et al.
2014, GCN 17131).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about
78 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak with a
duration (T90) of about 1.3 s (50-300 keV). The
time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+1.3 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.11 +/- 0.08
and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is
596 +/- 40 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.2 +/- 0.2)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+0.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.4 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
