FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) team reports the detection of a
likely long GRB.

At 16:11:15.73 UT on 01 February 2022, the  triggered and located GRB
220201A (trigger 665424680 / 220201674).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is RA =
14.7, DEC = -38.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to +00h 59m, -38d 41'), with a
statistical uncertainty of 4.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 16 degrees.
