behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.2 ks of XRT data for GRB 170419A, from 550 s to 59.3
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.02 (+0.14, -0.12).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.7 (+/-0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.6 (+1.2, -1.0) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 3.5 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.1 x 10^-11 (5.0 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.6 (+1.2, -1.0) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 3.5 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.1 sigma
Photon index:	     1.7 (+/-0.3)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.02, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.5 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 6.3 x
10^-14 (7.7 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
