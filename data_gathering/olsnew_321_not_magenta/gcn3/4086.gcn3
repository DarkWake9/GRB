A. Pelangeon & J-L. Atteia (LAT-OMP) report:

We have used the spectral parameters of the most intense part
of GRB 051008 provided by Golenetskii et al. (GCNC 4078),
to compute the spectral pseudo-redshift of this GRB.

We find a pseudo-redshift pz= 5.2 +/- 1.3

We thank V. Pal'shin for providing the fluence of this GRB during
the interval extending from T0 to T0+8.192 sec (KONUS time).
