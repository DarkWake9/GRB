on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:15:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070923 (trigger=292004). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 184.626, -38.268 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 18m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 16' 03"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
with a duration of about 100 msec.  The peak count rate
was ~8000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.0 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled.  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst.  This burst is
38 deg from the Sun and so is too close for later XRT observations. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
