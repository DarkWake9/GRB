P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya, T. Khanam and A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 190610B, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #24777), BALROG (Burgess J. et al., GCN # 24778) and Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov V. et al., GCN # 24779).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple pulses of emission with the strongest peak at 18:00:05.5 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 346 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 1899 cts. The local mean background count rate was 548 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 13.5 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
