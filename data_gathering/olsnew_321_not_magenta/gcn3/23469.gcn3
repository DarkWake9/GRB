S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo,
V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC, Versoix)
and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 180 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at   02:38 UT of 1 December 2018

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=  319.3009 deg
DEC.= -12.6242  deg

with an uncertainty of   2  arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst was bright and saturated the telemetry. Therefore, we can only
give lower limits to its  peak flux of greater than 2  counts/cm2/s (20-200
keV, 1-s integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of more than 1e-4  erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
