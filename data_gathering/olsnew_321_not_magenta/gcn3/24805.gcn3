The short GRB 190610A (Swift-BAT trigger #907754: Evans et al., GCN
Circ. 24775, Palmer et al., GCN Circ. 24783; Insight-HXMT/HE detection:
Cai et al., GCN Circ. 24782) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) at 11:27:45.359 UTC on 10 June 2019. The burst signal was seen
by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts at T+0.58 sec,
peaks at T+0.83 sec and ends at T+1.41 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 0.61 +- 0.16 sec and 0.26 +- 0.05 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET
Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
