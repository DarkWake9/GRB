J.C. Tello, R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (IAA/CSIC-UPV/EHU),
F. Aceituno (OSN, IAA-CSIC) and A. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC) on behalf of a
larger collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB130418A reported by De Pasquale et al. (GCNC
14377) with the 1.5 meter telescope at the Sierra Nevada Observatory using
an I band filter, where we clearly detect a fading source coincident with
the UVOT afterglow position.

Preliminary results of an image taken at 21h20m (2.33h after the burst)
with a 300s exposure show the source presented a magnitude of I~17.13 when
compared to the USNO-B1.0 catalogue. Another image taken at 22h45m (3.74h
after the burst) with an exposure time of 60s shows a magnitude of I~17.51
(also preliminarily and when compared to the USNO-B1.0 catalogue).

More images were taken and will continue to be taken when the source rises
again above the local horizon.
