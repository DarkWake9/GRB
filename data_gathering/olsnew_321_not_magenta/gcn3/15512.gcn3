Cale, M Heger (Horten videregående skole) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the INTEGRAL GRB 131122A (Gorbovskoy et al., GCN 15509) with the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with ALFOSC. Observations began at 00:34 UT (3.13 hr after the burst), when the field was at an airmass of ~3, and consisted of 8x180s in i-band, covering the complete INTEGRAL error box. The seeing of the combined image is around 0.9".

We do not see any obvious new source down to the limit of the SDSS i-band image to which we have compared, although we note that our frame is somewhat deeper, showing faint sources not present in the SDSS. A more precise localisation and/or deeper comparison image will be needed in order to identify a possible optical counterpart to GRB 131122A.
