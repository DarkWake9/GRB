The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at
the time of the S200112r (2020-01-12 15:58:38) the spacecraft was
preparing to the start the observations after the perigee passage
between the orbits number 2182 and 2183 and no scientific instrument
data are available between 2020-01-12T08:15:40 and
2020-01-12T18:14:13.
