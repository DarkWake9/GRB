TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 140114A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits 
DATE:    14/01/15 01:07:06 GMT

T. Guver (Istanbul Univ.), F. V. Ferrante (SMU), R. Kehoe (SMU), G. Dhungana
(SMU), and W. Zheng (UC Berkely) report on behalf of the ROTSE GRB team:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB
140114A (Swift trigger 583861; Troja et al, GCN 14728), producing images
beginning 22.4 s after the GCN notice time. An automated response took the
first image at 11:59:20.4 UT, 98.1 s after the burst, under fair conditions.
We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 9 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered
images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle; the field is not crowded.
Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 14.0-15.1; we set
the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-t_GRB(s)  Coadd?
