report:

We have obtained 36 R band images (each exposure time 60 seconds) of the
afterglow of GRB020813 (Fox, Blake & Price, GCN #1470) with the Bisei
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) 1.01-m telescope during 2002 Aug. 13
11:44 to 12:40 UT. A combined image of all exposures gives R = 19.35 +/-
0.13 using r magnitudes of near USNO_A2.0 stars as photometric
references.
