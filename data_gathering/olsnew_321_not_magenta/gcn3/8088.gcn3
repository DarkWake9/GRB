We observed the GRB 080810 afterglow with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope
(RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). We made a set
of exposures in BVRI between 8.3 and 12.6 hours after the burst. During our
observations the OT faded from 19.1 to 19.5 in R (USNO-B1.0 calibrated).

We also obtained a set of low resolution spectra using TFOSC
spectrometer. We detected Ly and other absorption lines and confirm the
redshift z=3.35 measured by Prochaska et al. (GCN 8083). Further analysis is
ongoing.
