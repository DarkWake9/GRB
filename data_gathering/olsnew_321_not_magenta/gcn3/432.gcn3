report:

"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and Wide Field Camera
(WFC unit 2) observed a gamma-ray burst triggered on November 5.6950
UT (BATSE trigger 7701).
A preliminary analysis reveals a duration of 13 s in the GRBM, with a
peak intensity of 970 cts/s in the 40-700 keV energy band.
In the WFC, the duration is 40 s and the peak flux is 1.1 Crab
(2-28 keV). The position of the X-ray counterpart is R.A. = 12h 03m 01s,
Decl. = -66d 48' 49" (equinox 2000.0) with an 99% error radius of  3.6'.
A BeppoSAX NFI follow-up observation will not be performed
due to sun-angle constraints."
