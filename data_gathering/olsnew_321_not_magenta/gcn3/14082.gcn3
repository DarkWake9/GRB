S. Schulze (PUC, MCSS), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), T. Pursimo, J.
Jessen-Hansen (NOT) and P. Jakobsson (U Iceland) report on behalf a larger
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 121212A, detected by Swift (Grupe et al., GCN
14064) and INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., GCN 14065), with ALFOSC mounted at
the NOT. Observations started at 03:07:39 UT on 14 December, i.e. 1.8412
days after the trigger. We obtained a series of four R-band images with an
individual exposure time of 300 s.

We detect an object inside the UVOT-refined XRT
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/00541371/) at

RA (J2000): 11:51:10.22
Dec (J2000): +78:02:14.51

We measured an R-band brightness of 23.5 +/- 0.1 mag with respect to four
USNO B1.0 stars (R2 magnitude). We did not apply any correction for
foreground extinction. Our measurement is consistent with Pozanenko et al.
(GCN 14079) and confirms that the object first reported by Kuin et al.
(GCN 14069) is the optical afterglow of GRB 121212A.
