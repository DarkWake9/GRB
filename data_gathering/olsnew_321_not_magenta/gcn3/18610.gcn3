TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  18610
SUBJECT: Swift-BAT resumption of normal operations

S.Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT Team:

Swift-BAT experienced a transient problem with thermal control
of the detector array commencing at 16:30 UT 31-Oct-15 ((GCN Circ 18562).
Thermal control was re-established and full triggering
to GRBs and transients resumed at 17:05 UT 06-Nov-15.
Survey and Monitor data were somewhat degraded due to elevated temperature
of the CZT and reduced bias voltage.  Normal temperature and full bias voltage
were achieved at 14:23 UT 13-Nov-15, resulting in a
full recovery to nominal BAT performance.
