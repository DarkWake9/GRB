GRB 981220 optical observations

C. Bartolini, S. Bernabei, I. Bruni, A. Guarnieri, A. Piccioni, 
University of Bologna, and N. Masetti and G. Pizzichini,
ITEsre-CNR, Bologna, communicate: "Four 40 min. R-band and one 40 min.
I-band CCD frames of the error box of GRB 981220 (Hurley et al., GCN #160)
were obtained with the 1.5-m telescope of the University of Bologna from 
1998 December 22.86 UT to 23.02 UT.
A preliminary analysis of the R band frames shows no variable object
within 0.3 mag. In the I band frame no new evident objects with respect of
the Palomar Digitized Sky Survey were observed inside the mentioned error 
box.
The seeing was 3.8"; the measurable limiting magnitude was R ~ 22 (for the 
sum of the four CCD frames) and I ~ 19.7.
