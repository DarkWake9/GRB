P. A. Evans (U Leicester), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester), K. K. Simpson (PSU) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 06:35:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200205A (trigger=954304).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 130.171, -35.245 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 40m 41s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 14' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). As is usual with an image trigger, the available
BAT light curve shows no significant structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 06:38:07.9 UT, 136.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 130.1717, -35.2715 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 08h 40m 41.21s
   Dec(J2000) = -35d 16' 17.4"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 95 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 3.00e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the UVW2 filter
starting  139 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a possible UVOT
counterpart close to the XRT position, but we cannot provide precise
coordinates at this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
