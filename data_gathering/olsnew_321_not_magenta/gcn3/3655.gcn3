K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 "The error region of the Swift GRB 050721a (Antonelli et al. GCN
3654) was imaged with the 0.3 m telescope in the New Mexico Skies
observatory.  The observation started at 2005 July 21, 04:35:23 UT
(369 s after the trigger) and several 120 s integrations in I band
were obtained.

 We identify a bright (I~15 mag) fading object whose position is
consistent with the XRT afterglow candidate reported in GCN
3654. However, this source does not seem to be spatially resolved with
a nearby 2MASS star in our frames. Further observations and analyses
are in progress."
