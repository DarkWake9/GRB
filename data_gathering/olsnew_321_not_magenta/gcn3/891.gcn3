NUMBER:  891
SUBJECT: GRB001109, optical observations
DATE:    00/11/23 00:23:50 GMT

 V.Petkov, on behalf of the peak Terskol Observatory GRB followup team.

We acquired on Nov 9.796 UT one R-band (300s exposure) image and 
one I-band (600s exposure) image of the GRB001109 error box
(GCN #885) using the CCD camera of the 2m peak Terskol Observatory telescope. 
Photometric calibration of the images was done based on USNO-A2.0
magnitudes in the R-band and with selected areas SA 113 and SA 92 
for the I band.
A comparison with Nov 15.653 (1200s exposure) images reveals no fading object
in the GRB error box down to R=19.6 and I=19.8.
