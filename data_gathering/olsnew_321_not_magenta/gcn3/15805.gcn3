Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140206A (trigger #585834)
(Lien, et al., GCN Circ. 15784).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 145.321, 66.762 deg which is
 RA(J2000)  =  09h 41m 16.9s
 Dec(J2000) = +66d 45' 42.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure with roughly three main pulse
durations. The first pulse duration starts at ~T-15 and ends at ~T+25 sec, and consists of
roughly three to four peaks. The second one starts at ~T+50 sec, peaks at ~T+60 sec,
and ends at ~T+90 sec. The third weaker pulse peaks at ~T+210 sec, with a long low-level tail
out to T+400 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 93.6 +- 13.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-37.2 to T+256.1 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.04 +- 0.15,
and Epeak of 100.9 +- 14.5 keV (chi squared 52.76 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+60.80 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
19.4 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.58 +- 0.03 (chi squared 91.21 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
