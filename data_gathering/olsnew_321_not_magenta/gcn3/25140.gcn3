The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:24:17 UT on 23 Jul 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190723A (trigger 585559462.869138 / 190723309).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 289.5, Dec = 25.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 18m, 25d 11'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70.0 degrees.
