Y. Evangelista, L. Pacciani, E. Del Monte and I. Donnarumma  
(INAF/IAPS), A. Trois (INAF/OAC) on behalf of the AGILE Team, report:

SuperAGILE localised the long-duration GRB 170115B (Hamburg et al.,  
GCN 20463; McEnery et al., GCN  20464; Sharma et al., GCN 20466; Xiao  
et al., GCN 20469; Verrecchia et al., GCN 20474; Frederiks et al., GCN  
20476, Shimizu et al., GCN 20483) on 15 January 2017, at 17:49:14 UT.

The event had a duration of about 50.0 s in the 18-60 keV energy  
range, with a multi-peaked structure. The burst position was  
reconstructed as:

RA(J2000):       189.011 deg (12h 36m 02.64s)

DEC(J2000):      -46.796 deg (-46d 47' 45.58")

with an uncertainty of 5' (radius). The uncertainty accounts for both  
the statistical and systematic errors.

The SuperAGILE error box is completely contained in the FERMI-LAT  
error box (McEnery et al., GCN  20464) and partially intersects the  
IPN annulus (Hurley et al., GCN 20475). The Swift-XRT afterglow  
candidate (D'Avanzo et al., GNC 20477) is also contained in the  
SuperAGILE error box.

Due to telemetry downlink restrictions, the SuperAGILE experiment has  
been kept on but with no telemetry download since late 2012. The full  
telemetry link for the AGILE mission has now been restored and the  
data of SuperAGILE are again routinely downloaded.
