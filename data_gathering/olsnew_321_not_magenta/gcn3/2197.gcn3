E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed the error circle of GRB 030429 (HETE trigger 2695) with the
VLA on 2003, May 2.10 UT at 8.46 GHz.  No sources are detected within the
error circle down to a 3-sigma limit of 0.18 mJy.  In particular, we do
not detect a radio source at the position of the optical counterpart
detected by Gilmore et al. (GCN 2184)."
