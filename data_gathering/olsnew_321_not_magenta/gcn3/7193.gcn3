A.J. van der Horst, C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC) and A. Kamble (University
of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the NGC 2770 transient (GCN 7159) at 1.4 GHz
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at January 18 19.30 UT to
January 19 6.86 UT.
The galaxy NGC 2770 is resolved and the flux density of the galaxy core is
~4.4 mJy. The flux at the position of XRF 080109 / SN 2008D (GCN 7178) is
~1.1 mJy. There is no significant detection of a point source at this
position.
The one-sigma rms noise in the map is 48 microJy per beam.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
