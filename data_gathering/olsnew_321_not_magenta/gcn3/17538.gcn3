M. M. Chester (PSU) and A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 150302A
110 s after the BAT trigger (Lien et al., GCN Circ. 17526). No optical 
afterglow consistent with the optical candidate reported by Fynbo et al. 
(GCN Circ. 17527) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures. Preliminary 
3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 
2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) are as follows.  We report only the 
second finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures; the first 
finding chart exposure was too short (< 2 s) to be useful.

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.02 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
