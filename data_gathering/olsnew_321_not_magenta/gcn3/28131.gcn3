TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 200716C: Swift-XRT refined analysis correction

K.L. Page and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

GCN 28129 (Gropp et al.) incorrectly included a sentence that stated it
was not possible to tell if the X-ray afterglow of GRB 200716C was fading.
In fact, the first snapshot of data shows a complicated structure, which
can be modelled by changes in slope and overlapping flares. The late-time
light curve (from T0+4.3 ks) can be modelled with a power-law decay with a
decay index of alpha=1.56 (+/-0.11).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
