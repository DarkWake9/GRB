M. C. Stroh (PSU), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) and D. M. Palmer (LANL)
report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 16:45:19.52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130727A (trigger=564342).  Swift could not slew to the burst
due to an Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec  330.800, -65.575 which is 
  RA(J2000) = 22h 03m 12s
  Dec(J2000) = -65d 34' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  BAT light curve data are currently unavailable. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+49.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
