The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 05:32:09 UT on 6 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200706A (trigger 615706334.325502 / 200706231).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 89.3, Dec = 54.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 57m, 54d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 48.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
