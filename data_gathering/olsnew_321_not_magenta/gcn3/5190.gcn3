F. Usui (ISAS/JAXA), M. Kuwahara (TUS/RIKEN), T. Tamagawa (RIKEN) report: 

"We observed the error region of GRB 051028 (Hurley et al. GCN 4172)
with the very wide-field camera WIDGET located at Akeno, Japan. WIDGET
monitored the region with repeat of unfiltered 5-second exposures
between 16.0 min and 11.2 min before the burst. We did not find any
optical emission from the afterglow position (Jelinek et al. GCN
4175). The 1-sigma limiting magnitude of each frame derived by the
Tycho-2 catalog was around V=10.3 magnitudes."
