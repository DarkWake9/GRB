TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

S. Sinha, P. Sreekumar, K. Kasturirangan, on behalf of SROSS C-2 (INDIAN
GRB EXPERIMENT) team report:
    SROSS C-2 observed this burst at 61116.784 s UT (this time may contain
small systematic errors). As observed by SROSS C-2, it had a duration
(T90) of 1.63 +- 0.05 secs, a 20-1024 keV fluence (not corrected for the
sec(theta) factor since we donot know the direction) equal to 1.15 X 10 -5
ergs cm-2. The peak flux (256 ms) in 20-100 keV band is equal to 20.09
photons cm-2 sec-1 and the peak flux (256 ms) in 100-1024 keV band is
equal to 12.15 photons cm-2 sec-1. The Hardness Ratio (at the peak of the
burst) is equal to 0.32 +- 0.05. Our Hardness Ratio is defined as
[counts(100-1024 keV)/counts(20-100 keV)]. For 21 SROSS C-2 GRBs that are
common with BATSE we find a mean Hardness Ratio of 0.97 +- 0.08 and the
standard deviation of the hardness distribution is equal to 0.37.
          This message is citable.
