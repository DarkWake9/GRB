Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW trigger event G298389 at T0 = 2017-08-19
15:50:46.990 UTC (GCN #21600)  we performed an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray
Imaging Detector
(GRID) data. At LIGO/Virgo trigger time (T0) the GRID exposure covered nearly
35% of the 90% c.l. LIGO/Virgo localization region (LR), observed at off-axis
angles between 45 and 70 deg.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
between -50 and +50 sec centered at T0.
Preliminary values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) obtained within the accessible
LIGO/Virgo LR are:

from 6.0e-08 to 1.2e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
