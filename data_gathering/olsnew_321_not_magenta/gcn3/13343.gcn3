A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We re-observed the position of GRB 120521C (GCN 13318) on 2012 May 
23.12 UT (1.15 d after the burst) with the EVLA at 21.8 GHz.   Within 
the enhanced Swift-XRT error circle (GCN 13324) we detect a brightening 
radio source with a flux density that is about a factor of two above our 
early 3-sigma limit of 50 uJy (GCN 13336).  We conclude that this is the 
radio afterglow of GRB 120521C.  Follow-up observations at multiple 
frequencies are in progress."
