Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160705B (trigger #703176)
(Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circ. 19657).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 168.107, 46.707 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 12m 25.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 42' 24.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows possible emission from before T-239 sec
(the beginning of the data), with the peak starting at ~T-30 sec, peaking
at ~T+10 sec, and ending at ~T+90 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 54.4 +- 12.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.09 to T+54.70 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.79 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.3 +- 1.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+26.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
