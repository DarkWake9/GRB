Dear Swift ToO Users/Community,

Please visit:
swiftobservatory.space
in order to submit a ToO request.

These instructions supersede all previous instructions sent.

If you already have a Swift ToO account, we ask that you use the same email
address for the form at swiftobservatory.space as is registered in your
account.

Note: Swift power users will not be able to access or duplicate old
requests at this time.

If you have an approved program for which we perform automated ToO
requests, these continue to function and require no action on your part.

We apologize for any and all inconvenience that may be caused. We will
endeavor to provide updates as soon as possible.

Thank you,
Swift Science Operations Team
