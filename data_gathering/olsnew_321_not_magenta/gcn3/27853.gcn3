Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez 
del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga), R. 
Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC), M.D. Caballero-Garcia and M. Jelinek 
(ASU-CAS), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) 
in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) automatically responded to GRB 
200529A as detected by Swift (D'Elia et al GCNC 27845). No new source is 
seen in the initial 10s exposure gathered at 00:58:28 UT(~ 113 s after 
the burst onset) down to a 18.0 limiting magnitude. Further images (20 x 
10s) were combined to produce a deeper image down to 18.8 mag limit at 
median time of 10.5 min post burst. No early-time bright optical 
emission is detected at the NOT (Malesani et al. GCNC 27846) and KAIT 
(Zheng et al. GCNC 27847) reported optical afterglow.

We thank the staff at La Mayora for its excellent support.
