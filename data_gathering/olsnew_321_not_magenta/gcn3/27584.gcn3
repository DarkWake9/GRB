The Swift GRB 200410A (Simpson et al., GCN Circ. 27518, Laha et al.,
GCN Circ. 27578; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200410A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:25:15.105 UTC
on 10 April 2020. The burst signal was seen by the SGM detector.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because
the real-time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal).

The burst light curve shows a weak pulse which starts at T-3.9 sec, peaks
at T-1.0 sec and ends at T+2.4 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by
the SGM data are 5.5 +- 2.2 sec and 2 +- 2 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
