D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space) and J. Prieto-Arranz (IAC) report 
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161022A (Stamatikos et al., GCN 20087) 
using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AlFOSC 
imaging camera. Observations started on 2016 Oct 22.161 UT, 68.5 min 
after the GRB, and consisted of 2x300 s exposures in the SDSS r band. 
Observations were affected by adverse weather conditions.

Within or in the proximity of the XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 20088), 
at a mid time of 73.9 min after the GRB trigger, we detect no new 
sources down to a limiting magnitude r > 22 (AB), calibrated against 
nearby SDSS stars.
