V. Shenoy (IITB), V. Bhalerao (IITB), S. Gupta, V. Sharma, A. Vibhute, D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 200817B.

The source was detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple pulses of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-08-17 06:03:44 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 453 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 3726 cts. The local mean background count rate was 488 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 21.0 s.

It was also detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
