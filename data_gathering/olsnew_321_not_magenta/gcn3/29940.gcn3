Eleonora Troja (GSFC/UMD) report:

We observed ZTF21aayokph (AT2021lfa) (Yao, Perley, & Ho, GCN Circ. 29938) with
the DDOTI wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra
San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) from 2021-05-05 03:18 to 04:10
UTC and obtained 2700 seconds of exposure in the w filter.

We observed a region covering aproximately 7 degrees in RA and 10 degrees in
declination (about 70 square degrees). We calibrated our images against the
APASS catalog.

We detect a source reported by Yao, Perley, & Ho (GCN Circ. 29938) with an AB
magnitude of w = 20.51 +/- 0.10.

Observations are continuing.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
