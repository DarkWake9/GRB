D. Malesani (SISSA), H. Navasardyan (INAF/OApD), S. Piranomonte 
(INAF/OAR), N. Masetti (INAF/IASF Bo), report on behalf of a larger 
Italian collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN 4682, 4689; 
Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) with the AFOSC instrument at the Asiago 
observatory (Northern Italy). The observing conditions were awful 
(seeing of ~3.3"). Photometry was carried out in the R- and i- filters.

Despite the bad sky conditions, the object was well detected in both 
filters (S/N~20). In particular, we find R = 19.65 +- 0.20 in comparison 
with several USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitude). The error is mostly due to 
calibration. The mean time of the R-band observations (lasting 1 hr 
overall) is 2005 Feb 7.0037 (0.80 d after the GRB).
