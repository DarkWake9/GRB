Swift Team:

At 03:29:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160506A (trigger=685245).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 265.774, -46.117 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 43m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -46d 07' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows broad peak
with a total duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 03:30:50.6 UT, 94.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
265.8484, -46.1340 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 17h 43m 23.60s
   Dec(J2000) = -46d 08' 02.3"
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 195 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, outside the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.67 x
10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4.8
(+2.85/-2.47) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 2.68e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 250 seconds with the U filter starting
101 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been
found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The typical upper limit has been 19.6 mag. The
8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT
error circle. The typical upper limit has been 18.0 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.26.
