D. M. Palmer (LANL) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 18:07:05 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180715A (trigger=848048).  Swift could not immediately
slew to the location due to the Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 235.069, -0.925 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 40m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 55' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single short
peak structure with a duration of about 0.7 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.9
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
