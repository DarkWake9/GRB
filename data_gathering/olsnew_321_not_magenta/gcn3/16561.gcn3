Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 15:17:52.85 UT on 09 July 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140709B (trigger 426611875 / 140709637)
which was also detected by Swift (Swenson et al. 2014, GCN 16551).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main peaks with a total duration
of about 150 s (50-300keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-132 s 
to T0+15 s is well fit by a power law function with an exponential 
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.32 +/- 0.07 and the 
cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 530 +/- 232 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.6 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.28 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.9 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
