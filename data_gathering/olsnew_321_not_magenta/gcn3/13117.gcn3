Myungshin Im, Jae-Woo Kim, and Duho Kim (CEOU/Seoul National Univ.)

We observed GRB 120326A (Siegel et al., GCN 13105) in
g,r,i,z,Y filters using CQUEAN camera on the 2.1m Otto-Struve 
telescope at McDonald Observatory, Texas, US.

The observation started at 2012-03-26 10:09:22 UT, 
or about 8.8 hours after the BAT alert. 
In all of the g,r,i,z,Y-band images with 300 sec
exposure time each, we clearly detect the afterglow
reported earlier (Klotz et al. GCN 13107, 
Guidorzi et al. GCN 13111, Walker et al. GCN 13112, 
Dintinjana et al. GCN 13113, Kuin et al. GCN 13114),

We thank Karl Gebhardt and Alysha Shugart for allowing us
to observe this object during their observing run.
We plan to perform additional observations.
