S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL), B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and
A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 01:55:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on a 
noise peak in the image plane (trigger=913042).  Swift did not slew 
due to an observing constraint with the Sun.  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is 
RA, Dec 154.464, +41.481, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 17m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 28' 53"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger, there is nothing
significant in the real-time light curve.
