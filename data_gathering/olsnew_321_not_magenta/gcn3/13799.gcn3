Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120922A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 534394) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 56 min after the GRB trigger
(starting at twilight). The elevation of the field decreased
from 46 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

Co addition of TAROT images from 56 to 85 minutes
after the GRB, shows the optical candidate reported
by Knust et al. (GCNC 13795) at magnitude R~20
(close to the limiting magnitude of TAROT).
Note the source NOMAD1 0698-0330778 (R.A.=234.7496389
Decl=-20.1828917 J2000) R=19.79 few arcsec southeastern
from the OT.
