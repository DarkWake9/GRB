report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106) with
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting on May 20 (UT) 
16:27:01. We took several images in R-filter with exposures of 120 s. 
The optical afterglow (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106; Izzo, et al., GCN 
21108) is clearly visible in single images.

We continued our observations on May 27 (UT) 16:28:02, i.e., ~8.5 days
after the BAT trigger. We took several R-filtered images. We do not 
detect the optical counterpart in the enhanced XRT error circle 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 21107).

Preliminary photometry of the afterglow is following:

The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars reported by
Mazaeva et al. (GCN 21169).
