WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 150314A (Hagen et al.,
GCN 17573) starting at 04:57:32 UT, 136 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was
20 s per image. The afterglow reported by Zheng and Filippenko
(GCN 17574) was detected in clear and I band, but not in V band.
Useful observations lasted for about 20 minutes before the weather
change to be coludy. Preliminary analysis shows that the afterglow
decays with a single power (with alpha = -1.12) from the
beginning of our observations until about a thousand seconds
after the burst. A preliminary light curve is posted at
