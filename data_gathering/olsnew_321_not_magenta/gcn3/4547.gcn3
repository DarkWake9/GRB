Brian Schmidt (ANU), Mark Wieringa (ATNF),

report on behalf of a larger collaboration

"We observed the field of GRB 061117 (GCN 4533, GCN 4538) with the 
Australia Telescope Compact Array at 4.8 and 8.6GHz beginning January 
18.4 UT. We detect no sources in a 20" box around the OT position (GCN 
4536) of 21:51:36.13 -59:58:39.1 (J2000)  to an approximate 4 sigma 
limit of 0.6 mJy at both frequencies. "

We would like to thank the Director and Staff of the Australia Telescope 
National Facility for obtaining these observations as part of a Target 
of Opportunity Program.
