The long burst, GRB 070626 (S. Golenetskii et al. GCN 6592) was
detected at 2007-06-26 04:07:30 UT (= T0) with the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky
Monitor (WAM), which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV. The burst
continues from T= T0-120 sec to T0+210 sec, as already reported on GCN
6592. The object position reported by GCN 6592 corresponds to the
incident angle of (theta, phi) = (103 deg, 169 deg) to the HXD WAM,
where the energy response is well calibrated. 
The fluence in the 100 -- 1000 keV energy band was 2.25(+- 0.01) x
10^-4 erg/cm2, and the 1-sec peak flux was 19.5 +/- 0.2 photons/cm^2/sec 
in the same energy range.

According to preliminary analyses, the time averaged spectrum from T0
to T0+190 sec in the 120 keV to 2.0 MeV energy band can be reproduced by 
the Band function (Band et al. 1993, ApJ 413, p281) with the following 
parameters;
  alpha = -1.55 +/- 0.05, 
  beta  = -2.15 +/- 0.05, and
  Epeak =   600 +/- 50 keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level, while systematic 
errors are not included. Since the on-board trigger system was disabled 
at the time of T0, no BST mode data with a time resolution of 15.625
msec is available, and the spectral analyses were performed by the 
continuous monitoring (TRN) data with the 1 sec resolution.

The light curve data with 1 sec resolution will be appeared at the web site
