report on behalf of a larger collaboration


We observed the field of Swift GRB 150910A (Pagani et al., GCN#18264) with
the 1.0 meter T100 telescope (Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory,
Turkey), starting September, 10, 20:08:16 UT (~ 11 hours after the
trigger). Observations were carried out in the R filter. The afterglow is
detected in the R band images with an exposure time of 300 s.


Using USNO-B1 star USNO-B1 1234-0008068 (R.A.=5.65, Dec=+33.45) in the
field, the magnitudes of the OT were estimated as follows;


t-t0 (hr) exp.(s) filt mag err (+/-)

10.97 300 R 20.09 0.23

11.06 300 R 20.18 0.25


Analysis of further observations with the same filter is ongoing.


We thank to TUBITAK National Observatory for a partial support in using
T100 telescope with project number 10CT100-95 and technical support.
