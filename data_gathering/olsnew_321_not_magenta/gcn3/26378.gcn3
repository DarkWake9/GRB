Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed detection of a GRB 191102A.

The source was detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed single pulse of emission peaking at 2019-11-02 12:18:21 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 198 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 634 cts. The local mean background count rate was 573 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 4.4 s.

It was also detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
