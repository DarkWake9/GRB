Recently, LIGO/Virgo announced the catalog of gravitational wave events
during the first two observing runs O1 and O2 [GWTC-1, arXiv:1811.12907]:
11 high-confidence and 14 marginal events.

INTEGRAL observations are available for 20 out of the 25 events from
the complete GWTC-1 sample, consistent with the INTEGRAL duty cycle of
about 85%.
In particular, the observations are available for 7 out of 11 (64%) of
the high-confidence gravitational wave events and 13 out of 14 (93%)
of the marginal ones.

For each of the observed events, INTEGRAL was sensitive to the entire
LIGO/Virgo localization region. Our preliminary search did not reveal
any new significant impulsive gamma-ray counterparts, setting typical
upper limits on the 1-s peak flux ranging from 1e-7 to 1e-6 erg/cm2/s
in 75-2000 keV energy range.

Detailed analysis and upper limits will be reported in a forthcoming paper.
