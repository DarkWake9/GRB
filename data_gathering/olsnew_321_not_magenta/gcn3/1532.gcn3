K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

S. Golenetskii and E. Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Konus and Ulysses observed this burst on 30 August 2002 at 65283 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of about 100 ms, a 25-100
keV fluence of 3.2x10^-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 32 ms of
1.5x10^-5 erg/cm2 s.  We have triangulated it to an annulus centered
at RA, Decl(2000)=347.605 o, -41.279 o, whose radius is 75.226 +/-
0.013 o (3 sigma).  As SGR1900 lies 0.002 degrees from the center line of
this annulus, we conclude that this burst is from that SGR.  This
appears to confirm the suggestion of Ricker et al. (GCN1525) that
SGR1900+14 may be entering a new period of activity.
