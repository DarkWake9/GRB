SUBJECT: GRB 131227A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    13/12/27 14:13:38 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 4481 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 6 UVOT
images, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the
XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue): RA, Dec = 67.37825, 28.88310 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  04 29 30.78
Dec (J2000): +28 52 59.2

with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
