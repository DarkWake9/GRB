S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, D. Svinkin, and 
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley and J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER NS GRB team,

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The short-duration, hard spectrum, bright GRB 140611A has been observed
by Konus-Wind, Swift (BAT), MESSENGER (GRNS), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
so far, at about 13864 s UT (03:51:04). The burst was outside the coded 
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
    ---------------------------------------------
     RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
    ---------------------------------------------
    Center:
     349.931 (23h 19m 43s) -40.077 (-40d 04' 38")
    Corners:
     349.762 (23h 19m 03s) -40.115 (-40d 06' 54")
     350.246 (23h 20m 59s) -40.726 (-40d 43' 33")
     350.100 (23h 20m 24s) -40.039 (-40d 02' 21")
     349.615 (23h 18m 28s) -39.417 (-39d 25' 02")
    ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 674 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 1.4 deg (the minimum one is 15.6 arcmin).

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
