TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  6924
SUBJECT: GRB 071010B: Optical observations of EST
DATE:    07/10/16 16:03:33 GMT
FROM:    L.P. Xin at NAOC  <xlp@bao.ac.cn>

We observed the afterglow (Oksanen, GCN 6873) of GRB 071010B
(Markwardt et al., GCN 6871) with the EST 1m telescope at
Xinglong Observatory started from 19:07:59(UT) Oct.11. Totally
11*600s V-band images were obtained. With the calibration data
reported by Henden (GCN 6909) we derived the afterglow had 
a magnitude V=20.75 +/- 0.05 with mid-time 23.314 hours 
after the burst.

Compared with the V-band magnitude of Daniel Kocevski 
(GCN 6919), we found the V-band magnitude of the afterglow
decayed deeply about 1 magnitude after about 5 hours.
