reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:57:39.90 UT on 07 October 2017, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 171007A (trigger 529070264 / 171007498),
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Cannizzo et al. 2017, GCN 21976).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 3.5 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.4 s to T0+2.1 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with
index -1.31 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.1 +/- 0.7)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
