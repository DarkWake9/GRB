The hard GRB 181225A (AGILE/MCAL detection: Ursi et al., GCN Circ. 23560;
Fermi-LAT detection: Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 23561;
Fermi GBM detection: Poolakkil et al., GCN Circ. 23562)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:44:11.011 UTC
on 25 December 2018. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows the initial hard pulse which starts
at T-0.6 sec and ends at T+1.1 sec, followed by a weaker and softer tail
seen up to T+10.8 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
10.6 +- 0.8 sec and 7.5 +- 0.8 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

Although the measured durations put this GRB in the long class,
its hard initial pulse which has a duration of ~1.7 sec and
the weaker and softer tail may imply that this GRB is in fact
a short GRB with extended emission or it is similar to the famous
"long-short" GRB 060614 (Gehrels et al. 2006, Nature,
444, 1044: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05376).

the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
