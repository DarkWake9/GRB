The long-duration GRB 171120A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN circ. 22133; Longo et al.,
GCN circ. 22136; Frederiks et al., GCN circ. 22142; Sharma et al., GCN circ. 22143;
Li et al., GCN circ. 22149) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 13:20:02 on 20 November 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM
instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two largely separated episodes.  The first
episode starts at T0, peaks at T+1 sec and ends at T+4 sec.  The second
episode starts T+38 sec, peaks at T+40 sec and ends at T+46 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 44.4 +- 0.9 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
