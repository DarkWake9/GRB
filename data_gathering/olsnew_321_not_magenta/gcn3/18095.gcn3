We observed the field of GRB 150727A (Cenko et al., GCN 18076) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2015/07 29.15 to 2015/07 29.19
UTC (32.64 to 33.50 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of
0.70 hours exposure in the r, i, and z bands.

We no longer detect the source seen on the previous night (Watson et
al., GCN 18089). In comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we
obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

   r	> 22.27
   i	> 22.61
   z	> 19.11

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source has faded by at least 1 magnitude in both r and i. We
therefore suggest that it it corresponds to the afterglow.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
