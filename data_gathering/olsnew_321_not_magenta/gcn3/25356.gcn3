We report observations of the LALInference skymap of the NSBH event
S190814bv (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration, 25333, 25324) with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope (Chambers
et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560C). Images were taken in the PS1 i and z
bands (Tonry et al. 2012, ApJ 750, 99).

Beginning at 2019-08-15 12:40:37 UT (58710.5282) or 15.5hrs after the
detection of S190814bv, observations started in the i-band. We used
the updated LALInference.v1.fits.gz map for pointing coverage.
Observations finished at 2019-08-15 15:13:38 UT.

At each pointing position a dithered sequence of 45 sec i-band and
z-band images were taken. These were combined into a single night
stack, covering the GPC1 camera chip gaps. These dithered sequences
were repeated, with overlaps, to map 18 square degrees of the
LALInference.v1.gz map 90% credible region, corresponding to a summed
probability 89% of the skymap. We did not cover the smaller
probability blob to the south east at DEC=-32.

Conditions were somewhat affected by clouds, and moon, seeing was
around 1.2 - 1.3 arcsec. 5-sigma limiting magnitudes were around i ~
20.8 and z ~ 20.3.

The images were processed with the IPP (Magnier et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05240) and difference images were produced using the
Pan-STARRS1 Science Consortium 3Pi images as reference frames.
Transient candidates were run through our standard filtering
procedures, combined with a machine learning algorithm (Wright et al.
2015, MNRAS, 449, 451) were applied and all candidates were spatially
cross-matched with known minor planets, and major star, galaxy, AGN
and multi-wavelength catalogues (as described in Smartt et al. 2016,
MNRAS, 462 4094), and already reported transients in the TNS before
S190814by.

After removing these, and requiring detections in BOTH i and z-band
stacks, we were left with two transients. Both of which we discount as
possible counterparts.

Name    | TNS Name  | RA (J2000)  | Dec (J2000) | Disc MJD |  i Mag err  | z Mag err
PS19epf | AT2019noq | 00 48 47.88 | -25 18 23.4 | 58710.58 |  19.93 0.11 | 20.17 0.16
PS19eph | AT2019nor | 00 49 51.99 | -24 16 17.7 | 58710.59 |  19.69 0.07 | 19.55 0.07 

PS19epf is within the inner 20% contour. It is located 0.46"S 3.96"E
from the centre of the galaxy PSO J012.1980-25.3064 (r = 18.3 Kron
mag). The host has no measured photometric or spectroscopic redshift.
However there are 4 separate, single night detections in the ZTF
public stream, from Lasair (Smith et al. 2019;
https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF19abkhnce/), across the last 12
days. Hence it is most probably a SN exploding before the GW.

PS19eph is within the inner 10% contour. However it is coincident with
the core of the B=18.67 galaxy 6dF J0049520-241618 at z = 0.436522
from NED, and hence is not likely related to S190814bv.

We do not recover desgw-190814b (AT2019nme). Reported at i=19.33
z=19.39, (58710.278) by Soares-Santos et al. GCN 25336. This is on the
edge of our stack, but we estimate a 3-sigma limit of i~20.6 z~20.2.
If it is real, it implies a very fast fade in i-band of 1 mag in about
8hrs. Deeper follow-up is required, and confirmation from the DECam
team if it is real.
