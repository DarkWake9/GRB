The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:06:56 UT on 23 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191023A (trigger 593536021.755384 / 191023630).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 295.3, Dec = 6.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 41m, 6d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
