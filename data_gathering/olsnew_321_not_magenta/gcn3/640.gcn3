Paul Price, Tim Axelrod and Brian Schmidt report that  
we have imaged the error-circle of GRB000416 / 1SAXJ1715.0-7134 with the
50-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory.  Exposure details are:

Date		Exp Time	Limiting Mag.
April 18.47	3 x 300s	R_M ~ 19.5
April 18.70	6 x 300s	R_M ~ 20.7

where R_M refers to the MACHO red passband.

We see no new variable candidates within the error circle, either from
comparison of both epochs with the DSS, or from subtraction of the two
epochs.
