A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U.
Leicester), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), M.G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB), E.
Ambrosi  (INAF-IASFPA) , B. Sbarufatti (PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), 
 and V. D'Elia report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 220708A (D'Elia et al. GCN
Circ. 32343), from 2.5 ks to 49.4 ks after the	BAT trigger. The data
comprise 257 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in
Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was
given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 32347).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.1 (+nan, -nan).

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.1, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 8.8 x 10^-4 count s^-1

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
