report:

At 00:03:30 UT (209 SOD) on 16 September 2004, the WXM instrument
on HETE detected GRB040916 (= H3558), a long, two-peaked XRF.  The 
burst has been localized to a circle of 18' radius centered on

  RA = 23h 01m 44s, Dec = -5d 37' 43" (J2000)

The burst consists of two peaks separated by ~250s, each ~100s in 
duration.  No formal spectral analysis has been performed using WXM
data, but the dearth of counts in bands > 10 keV in either peak is a 
strong indication that GRB040916 is an XRF.

We anticipate providing additional spectral information from this 
unusual event in a subsequent GCN Circular.
