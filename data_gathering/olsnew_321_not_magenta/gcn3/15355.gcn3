SUBJECT: GRB 131018A: KAIT Optical Upper Limit

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to GRB 131018A (Melandri et al., GCN 15349)
starting at 12:50:47 UT, 179 s after the burst. Observations were
performed with an automatic sequence in the V, I, and clear(roughly R)
filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image. Comparing to the SDSS
image, we do not detect new sources in our single images or in coadds of
5 images within the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 15352).
There is a faint stellar object (r = 22.2 mag) in the SDSS image 1.8"
from the enhanced XRT position, but it is beyond our limiting magnitudes
of R ~ 18.7 for single images and R ~ 19.6 for 5 coadded images.
