A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (ASDC), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 06:12:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered 
on increasing count rate due to the approach to the SAA and
produced an image with a marginal-significance peak (trigger=752193).  
The BAT light curve shows the increasing count rate due to 
approaching the SAA, but no obvious peak at the trigger time. 

The XRT began observing the field at 06:13:06.4 UT, 51.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. 

Due to the lack of a clear peak in the BAT lightcurve, the
marginal (6.5 sigma) BAT image peak, and the lack of an
XRT counterpart, we believe that this event was due to particle
background near the SAA and is not an astrophysical event.
