A hard GRB 040329 was detected by Konus-Wind at 11:10:50.060 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 11:10:51.757 UT.
It had a duration of approximately 2.3s,
fluence 4.6x10-5 erg/cm2, and peak flux 1.2x10-4 erg/(cm2 s),
both in 20-8000 keV range. Preliminary spectral analysis gives
a value of Ep = 1900 +/- 100 keV.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 114.620 deg,
Decl(2000) = 22.903 deg,
Radius = 59.12  +/- 0.16 degrees (3 sigma ).

In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response limits the
arrival directions to an ecliptic latitude of -30 +/- 7 degrees.
