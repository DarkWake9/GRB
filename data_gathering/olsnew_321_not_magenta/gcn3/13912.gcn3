We observed the field of the Swift GRB 121011A (Racusin et al., GCN
13845) with ZTSh telescope of CrAO on Oct. 15 between (UT) 17:36 and
18:54 under good weather condition with mean seeing of about 1.5
arcsec. We took 70 frames with exposure of 60 seconds in filter R.  In
a stacked image we do not detect any source within enhanced XRT error
circle (Evans et al., GCN 13850).

We also observed the field of this GRB with Zeiss-1000 telescope of
SAO RAS on Oct. 17 between (UT) 17:45 and 18:38 under good weather
conditions with mean seeing of about 2.4 arcsec. We took 12 frames
with exposure of 200 seconds. On a stacked image we do not detect any
source either. The photometry based on a USNO-B1 star #1310-0279773
(R1 = 17.84; same
as calibration in Fynbo et al., GCN Circ. 13856; Malesani et al., GCN
13853) is following:
