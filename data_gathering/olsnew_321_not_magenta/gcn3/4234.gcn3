report:

A short soft GRB triggered the Konus-Wind instrument
at T0=9044.551 s UT (02:30:44.551) on November 7. 
It was also observed by Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

We have triangulated this burst to the 3sigma
confidence error box:

                   RA(2000) Dec(2000)
----------------------------------------
ERROR BOX CENTER:   94.016 -18.977

ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 102.953 -14.291 
ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  85.388 -24.124
ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  83.432 -22.350
ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 101.222 -12.721
---------------------------------------

The area of the error box is ~40 sq. deg.

The total burst duration is 1.75 sec.

The K-W spectrum integrated over the most intense
part of the GRB (from T0 to T0+0.256 sec) is 
well fitted (in the 20 - 500 keV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-E/E0)
with alpha = -0.51  (-1.07, +0.71)
and E0 = 60 (-24, +38) keV (chi^2 = 15/27 dof).
The peak energy Ep = 151 (-26, +34) keV.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had a fluence 
1.42(-0.79, +0.16)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and
peak flux on 64-ms time scale 2.0(-1.2, +0.3)x10^-6 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 - 500 keV).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
