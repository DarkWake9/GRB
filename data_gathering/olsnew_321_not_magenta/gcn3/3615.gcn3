Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink, we report
further analysis of Swift-BAT Trigger #145994 (Levan, et al., GCN 3613).
The ground-analysis position is RA,Dec 169.697,-15.535 (J2000).
The event-by-event data yields a lightcurve with a broad bump
starting at T+15 sec and ending at T+70 sec.
The spectrum over the interval from T-19 to T+68 seconds is soft.
The simple power law photon index is 2.6 +/- 0.3 with a fluence
of 6.5 +/- 1.4 X 10^-7 erg/cm^2 in the 15-350 keV band (90% c.l.).
The peak flux in a 1-sec wide window starting at T+55 seconds
is 0.5 +/- 0.2 ph/cm^2/sec.
Although we can not rule out a hard x-ray transient source,
it is more likely a real GRB, albeit on the soft end of the distribution.
