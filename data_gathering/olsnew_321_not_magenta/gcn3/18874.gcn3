SUBJECT: GRB 160117A: Swift detection of a burst

C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:13:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160117A (trigger=670793).  Swift could not slew to the 
burst location due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 20.408, -0.627 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 21m 38s
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 37' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 00:56 UT on 2016 January 18. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. B. Markwardt (Craig.Markwardt AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
