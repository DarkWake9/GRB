behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Skynet observed the localization of GRB 060306 (Angelini et al., GCN 4848)
with one of the 16-inch PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 49 sec after
the burst (25 sec after notification).

No new source is found, to i' > 17.4 mag at 7.5 min after the burst and r'
> 16.8 mag at 9.3 min after the burst (3 sigma; calibrated to five
USNO-B1.0 and NOMAD stars, respectively, using the transformation equations
of Smith et al. 2002.)

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned.
