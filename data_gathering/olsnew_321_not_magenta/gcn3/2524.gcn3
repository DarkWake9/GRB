 and J. Casares (IAC, Tenerife) report:
 
 During the nights Nov 13, 14 and 15, 2003 we observed the error box
 of GRB031111 (Hete burst H2925, Hurley et al., GCN #2443) in R band
 with the 1m ESA OGS telescope (operated on the island of Tenerife by
 Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias at the Observatorio del Teide),
 and the IAC CCD camera.
 The initial HETE-WXM field was divided in 9 overlapping subfields.
 With the exception of about 7% of the area at the corners, the full
 final HETE-IPN error box was observed.
 The images intersecting the error box were selected, and we obtained:
 
 13 images x 600 sec on Nov. 13.14 UT (mean epoch)  
 12 images x 600 sec on Nov. 14.16 UT (mean epoch)
  5 images x 600 sec on Nov. 15.04 UT (mean epoch)
 
 Our coadded images of subsequent nights attained just the limit of
 POSS-II, and by comparison we can state that no new object is present.
 Within the same limit and on a time scale of 3 days we do not detect
 any variable object with amplitude > 0.3 mag.
 A few selected images, the observation log and a short comment are
 available in our public account; the coordinates to login (only by ssh
