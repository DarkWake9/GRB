There are 6 MASTER Very Wide Field cameras located at Kislovodsk and 
Irkutsk with common FOW = 6000 square degrees 
(http://observ.pereplet.ru/).

One of the four  MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Kislovodsk
(D=50 mm, 4x1000 square degrees, 11 Mpx) has observed  ~80% 1-sigma Fermi
error box  (P. N. Bhat, GCN 9020) with 1s exposure
during  all night: befoure, during and after GRB Time
without time gap between images.

Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitude limit of the each emage is  ~9.0 m at the edge of FOW (some 
ising was attend at this night).

We do not detect OT inside 80% part of the error box.

  T-T_trigger            m_lim (S/N=3)         Exposure         Coadd

-10s... 0... 60 s          9.0                   1 s             no
-1min...0...+1 min        10.5                  10 s             10
-1min...0...+1 min        11.0                  60 s             60

We  conclude (in the case that GRB inside our FOW ):

1). the optical fluence during the short 58 s GRBurst is limited by

                        ~<=  1.5 x 10E-8 erg/cm_2

excluding possible  host galaxy absorbtion.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.1 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2 (P. N. Bhat, GCN 9020).

So:

2).  Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8-1000 keV) ~ < 1/70

The same ratio for long GRB080319B is

Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8 - 1000 keV) ~ 1/140

(Naked Eye GRB, Racusin, Karpov et al., Nature, vol.455, 183, 2008).

Black circle is the 1-sigma (9.5 degrees, P. N. Bhat, GCN 9020)
error box.

The film of added images (60s effective exposition) our observations (from 
-60s before to 60 s after GRB time)is available at

The reduction is continued.

  T-T_trigger            m_lim (S/N=3)         Exposure         Coadd

-255s... 0... 255 s       11.8                  5s              yes 
-2min...0...+2 min        12.7                 2x30s             12
-2min...0...+2 min        13.0                 2x60s             24

The optical fluence during the 40s-GRBurst is limited by

     <= 1.6x10_-8 erg/cm_2


including 2.8 magnitude  absorbtion (Ukwatta et al., Circ 8462).
The  BAT-fluence is aboute 2.3x10_-6 erg/cm_2 (15-150 keV) (Fenimore et al., 
GCN 8468).

So:

Optical Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(15-150keV) ~ < 1/140

Same ratio for GRB080319B is ~ 1/25 (Naked Eye GRB) in 15-150 keV (Racusin, 
Karpov et al., Nature, vol.455, 183, 2008).

Note: the GRB was at the edge of the FOW in both cameras.
