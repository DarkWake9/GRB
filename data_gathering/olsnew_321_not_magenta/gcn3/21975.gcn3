As previously reported (GCN 21680, GCN 21848), the Long Wavelength
Array (LWA1, located west of Socorro, New Mexico) followed up on
G298048 on 17 August and 24 August, observing with 4 beams: one
centered on NGC 4993, one including it off-center, and two nearby that
exclude the source.

After including observations from an additional epoch (30 August at
19:50 UTC, two weeks after the GW event), and further analysis, we
have concluded that the detection reported earlier (GCN 21848) is not
statistically significant. We now set 3-sigma upper limits to the
appearance of a radio source in an LWA1 beam centered on NGC 4993,
about 8 hours after the GW event, as ~200 Jy at 25 MHz and ~100 Jy
at 45 MHz.

A publication describing these limits and our analysis is in
preparation.
