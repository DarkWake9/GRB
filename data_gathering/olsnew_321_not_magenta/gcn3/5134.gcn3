TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB 060515: TAROT optical observation

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060515 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 210084) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 60.0s after the GRB trigger
(9s after the notice). The field elevation decreased from
29 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

Date of trigger : t0 = 2006-05-15T02:27:53

First image is 60s exposure trailed.
No optical transcient (OT) is visible:
t0+60.0s to t0+120.0s : R > 15.1

Second image is 30s exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+126s to t0+156s : R > 16.2

We co-added a series of all 17 exposures
taken between t0+126s and t0+1497s.
We detect a possible OT candidate R~18
at the position (+/- 5 arcsec):

RA(J2000.0) = 08h 29m 10.42s
DEC(J2000.0) +73d 32' 54.6"

The limiting magnitude of the image is R ~ 18.2.
The OT candidate is very faint and we cannot confirm
it because no more images can be taken because the
twilight occured.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-A2 stars

Galactic coordinates are lon=140.7911 lat=+32.7885
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.1 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
