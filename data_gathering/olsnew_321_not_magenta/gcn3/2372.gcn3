SUBJECT: INTEGRAL ToO OBSERVATIONS OF SGR1806-20: CALL FOR CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS

FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

K. Hurley and D. Hartmann, on behalf of a large collaboration, report:

A 240 ksec INTEGRAL target of opportunity observation of SGR1806-20 has
been scheduled for 2003 September 03, starting at 22:45 UT.
Simultaneous observations at all wavelengths, but particularly in the
NIR (bearing in mind that the reddening is AV=29 mag), are encouraged.
The best position for this SGR is the one obtained by Chandra
(Eikenberry et al., ApJ 563, L133, 2001; Kaplan et al., ApJ 564, 935,
2002):

RA(2000)=18 h 08 m 39.32 s, Decl(2000)=-20 o 24 ' 39.5 "

Updates to the INTEGRAL schedule will be posted at:
