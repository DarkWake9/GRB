Subject: GRB 030329: KAIT optical photometry

Weidong Li, Ryan Chornock, Saurabh Jha, and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley)
report:

We have observed the GRB 030329 afterglow (Peterson & Price, GCN 1985) with 
the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) on the nights of 2003 Mar 30 
and 31 UT. 16 sets of UBVRI images were taken. Aperture photometry was
performed on the afterglow and some local standard stars in IRAF, and the 
instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the standard BVRI system using
the calibration provided by Henden (GCN 2023). We have also applied color
corrections to the KAIT data based on well-measured color terms for the KAIT
filters. Due to the lack of U-band calibrations, only BVRI images were reduced.
Our R-band photometry is summarized in the table below.  The errors quoted
include both the IRAF aperture photometry error and the magnitude
transformation error.
