Swift Team:

At 07:05:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081127 (trigger=335715).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 332.093, +6.859 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 08m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 51' 33"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peak of 2
seconds on a broader plateau with a total duration of about 30 sec. 
The peak count rate was ~900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~7 sec 
after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:07:10.8 UT, 121.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
332.0646, 6.8504 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 22h 08m 15.49s
   Dec(J2000) = +06d 51' 01.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 106 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
6.86e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 9.56e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 130 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.09.  The XRT position is 9.8 arcseconds from the B = 13 USNO-B1.0 star 0968-0627697.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
