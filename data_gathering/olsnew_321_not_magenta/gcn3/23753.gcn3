M. Marongiu (U. Ferrara), G. Carboni, A. Melis, A. Pellizzoni 
(INAF/OAC), and Sara Loru (INAF/OACT), report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN 23688) with the Sardinia 
Radio Telescope (SRT, www.srt.inaf.it) through single-dish imaging in 
C-band (central frequency 6.9 GHz, bandwidth 1.5 GHz) in the time 
interval 16:30-22:00 UTC on January 18, 2019 (2.8-3.1 days after the burst).

At the position of the radio afterglow (Alexander et al. GCN 23726), we 
did not detect any significant signal with a 2-sigma upper limit of 3 mJy.

We acknowledge the TAC, the scheduler and the SRT staff for approving 
and executing these observations.
