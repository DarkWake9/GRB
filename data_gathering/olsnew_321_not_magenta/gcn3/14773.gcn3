At 23:41:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130605A (trigger=557508).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 134.524, -33.489 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 58m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = -33d 29' 20"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
with a duration of about 8 sec.  The peak count rate was ~2000 counts/sec 
(15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 23:43:14.6 UT, 92.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. No prompt event mode data were available as Swift entered
the SAA shortly after the burst was detected. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 107 seconds with the White filter
starting 95 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.36. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. T. Holland (sholland AT stsci.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
