on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:02:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080915 (trigger=324744). The BAT on-board calculated location 
is RA, Dec 18.004, -76.014 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 12m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = -76d 00' 51"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+62.4 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. R. Oates (sro AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
