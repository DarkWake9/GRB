GRB030922 was detected by Konus-Wind at 08:43:24.120 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 08:43:22.193 UT. It has a duration of ~35 sec.
There was a possible weak precursor 190 sec before trigger time, it had 
been detected by both instruments.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 262.610 deg,
Decl(2000) = -18.591 deg,
Radius = 54.9 +/- 3.0 degrees (3 sigma ).
