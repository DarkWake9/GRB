W. Li, R. Chornock, A. V. Filippenko, and S. Jha (UC Berkeley) report:

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) responded to GRB 030723
(HETE Trigger #2777) automatically. The first four alerts issued via
GCN at 6:29 UT, 6:37 UT, 6:43 UT, and 6:45 UT were not observed due to
altitude limits, and we remotely (but manually) obtained 8 images starting
at 7:38 UT (about 1.2 hours after the burst), covering a 12'.5 x 12'.5
region centered on R.A. = 21:49:41, Decl. = -27:48:29 (J2000). KAIT
responded to the alert issued via GCN at 9:47 UT (3.3 hours after the
burst) automatically, and obtained 9 images covering a 12'.5 x 12'.5
region centered on R.A. = 21:48:51, Decl. = -27:41:16 (J2000). The alert
issued at 13:38 UT was not observed due to bright dawn. 

Visual inspection of the images reveals no obvious new source compared
with the DSS II (red) to a limiting magnitude of 19.0 - 20.0 (the images
have different exposure times). Specifically, the images taken around
7:38 UT covered about 50% of the error circle of the ground analysis burst
position issued at 13:38 UT via GCN.
