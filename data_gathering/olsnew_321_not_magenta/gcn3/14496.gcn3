report:

We observed the field of GRB 130427B (Maselli, et al., GCN 14460) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/04 28.44 to 2013/04 28.48 UTC (21.26 to
22.19 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.71 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.29 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and
H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Osborne, et al., GCN
14467), in comparison with USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper
limits (3-sigma):

  r' > 22.08
  i' > 22.06
  Z  > 21.28
  Y  > 20.77
  J  > 20.57
  H  > 19.84

These limits,  in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic extinction
in the direction of the GRB, were derived from PSF-fitting photometry,
because of the presence of a 16.5 magnitude star only 5 arcseconds to the
south of the SWIFT-XRT source position.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
