D.K. Sahu, B.C. Bhatt, G.C. Anupama, T.P. Prabhu (Indian Institute of
Astrophysics, Bangalore) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

GRB 021004 was observed with the HFOSC instrument on the 2-m Himalayan
Chandra Telescope on 4 and 5 October 2002. The magnitudes with respect to
the comparison star of Fox (GCN 1564) as calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583)
on October 4 are listed below:

22:40:30	18.77   0.03
23:14:33	18.78   0.03

These results supersede the ones reported in GCN 1581. Preliminary
magnitudes for October 5 are

UT	R

17:38	19.38
22:10	19.70

The decay appears to have steepened following the bump noticed by Winn et
al (GCN 1576).

The spectra recorded with the same instrument on October 4 show the
redshift systems with z=1.38 and 1.60 (GCN 1582). The identification of
z=1.72 in GCN 1582 was erroneous and is regretted. On the other hand, we
confirm the presence of unidentified lines reported by Eracleous et al
(GCN 1579).

The message may be cited.
