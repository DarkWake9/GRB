D. A. Perley (Caltech), A. Cucchiara (NASA/GSFC), and N. R. Tanvir (U.
Leicester) report:

We imaged the position of GRB 131229A (Page et al., GCN 15627) using 
GMOS-S on the Gemini-South 8m telescope in i- an z-bands starting at 
07:33:07.5 UT (54 minutes after the GRB).  A total of 6 x 180s of 
imaging was acquired in each filter.

Sources detected in the reduced stack inside or close to the (onboard,
5" radius) XRT error circle (with J2000 positions) include:

A (05:40:55.85, -04:23:40.6), a point source north of the error circle
B (05:40:55.70, -04:23:43.4), an extended source
C (05:40:55.92, -04:23:45.9), a faint, marginally detected source

No statement about variability or association with the GRB can be made
at this time.  All of these sources are fainter than the P60 and USNO
limits.
