Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 00:17:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
background noise during high background increase while entering 
the SAA (trigger=1015615). The BAT light curve shows the background 
increase near the SAA, without any significant burst structure. 

The XRT began observing the field at 00:18:47.7 UT, 95.1 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No valid point source was found in the XRT data. Automated
position reported through GCN Notices is due to a cosmic ray, and should 
be ignored. 

This event was initiated by the BAT rate increase on approach to 
the SAA, which yielded an image with a marginal (6.5 sigma) fluctuation. 
Based on the lack of a GRB-like rate increase above the ramping up
BAT rates on SAA approach, the low significance of the image peak, 
and the non-detection of an XRT afterglow, we believe that this is
not an astrophysical event.
