Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190613A (trigger #908288)
(Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 24798).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 182.552, 67.244 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 10m 12.5s
   Dec(J2000) = +67d 14' 39.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 9%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~T0, peaks
at ~T+7 s, and ends at ~T+20 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 17.6 +- 3.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.6 to T+20.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.22 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-6
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.88 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.5 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
