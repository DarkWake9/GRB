TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4826
SUBJECT: GRB 060223B: ART optical limits
DATE:    06/02/24 04:50:21 GMT
FROM:    Ken ichi Torii at RIKEN  <torii@ess.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp>

K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of GRB 060223B (Cummings et al. GCN 4821) was
observed with the 0.35m ART-3b in Toyonaka, Osaka. Repeated 60 s
exposures in BVRcIc were started at 19:43:39 UT (155 s after the BAT
trigger).

 Preliminary analysis does not reveal a new object within the revised
BAT error radius (Fenimore et al. GCN 4825) and the following 3 sigma
upper limits are derived with reference to USNO-B1.0 catalog.
