D. Roberts, U. Kolb & M.Morrell (The Open University) reporting on behalf of the PIRATE group:


We observed 15 separate fields within the LALInference update skymap of the LIGO/Virgo candidate G297595 using our 0.43m robotic telescope at Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Spain. We acquired 118 images across 7 nights of observations, all images were obtained using the R filter and 100s exposure length. Initial observations began at 2017-08-17T04:45:22, approximately 15hrs after receiving the updated alert, and 2.75 days after the initial trigger. A detailed list of all the fields observed can be found on GraceDB under the EMObservations tab. A high number of poor quality images (19) and low cadence made transient searches difficult but our initial analysis suggests no new transients were detected in any of the observing fields down to a limiting magnitude ~17. Further analysis is ongoing.
