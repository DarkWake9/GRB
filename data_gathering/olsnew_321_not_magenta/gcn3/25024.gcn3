on behalf of the Swift-BAT team,

The short-duration GRB 190704A has been detected by Konus-Wind,
INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS trigger 8323) and Swift (BAT), so far,
at about 22353 s UT (06:12:33).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Corners:
   329.352 (21h 57m 25s) +48.888 (+48d 53' 15")
   328.224 (21h 52m 54s) +47.140 (+47d 08' 24")
   240.886 (16h 03m 33s)  -1.156 ( -1d 09' 23")
   242.721 (16h 10m 53s)  -1.662 ( -1d 39' 42")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 175 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 88.2 deg (the minimum one is 57.1 arcmin).
The Sun distance was greater than ~100 deg.

This box may be improved.

Fermi-GBM was enabled at the time of the GRB according to
glg_poshist_all_190704_v00.fit, so the non-detection by GBM
implies that the burst was Earth-Occulted for Fermi.

This burst is spatially and temporally inconsistent with IceCube-190704A 
(The IceCube Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24981) and Baksan Neutrino 
Observatory Alerts on 2019-07-03 (Lipunov et al., GCN Circ. 24976
and 24980).

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
