Using Konus-Wind (KW) data, we have performed a search for
a gamma-ray transient around the time of the cosmic neutrino
candidate IceCube-171015A (2017-10-15 01:34:30.06 UT,
hereafter T0; Blaufuss, GCN 22016;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/56068624_130126.amon)

No triggered KW event happened from ~3.3 days before and up to ~3.6 days
after T0. The closest waiting-mode event was ~1.9 hours after T0.
Using waiting-mode data within the interval T0  +/- 1000 s,
we found no significant (> 5 sigma) excess over the background
in both KW detectors on temporal scales from 2.944 s to 100 s in the 
80-1000 keV band.

We estimate an upper limit (90% conf.) on the 10 keV â€“ 10 MeV fluence
to 8.7x10^-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 2.944 s and having a
typical KW short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with
alpha =-0.5 and Ep=500 keV). For a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band
function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the corresponding
limiting peak flux is 3.1x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (10 keV - 10 MeV, 2.944 s 
scale).

All the quoted values are preliminary.
