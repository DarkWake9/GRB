We observed the optical counterpart to GRB020813 (Villasenor et al., GCN
1471; Fox, Blake & Drake, GCN 1470) between August 13.994 and August
14.148 (22.9 to 24.8 hours after the GRB trigger). The observations were
performed with the ESO VLT-3 (Melipal) telescope equipped with FORS1
with a Bessel V band filter in the imaging polarimetry mode. The
transient source is clearly detected in the acquisition image.

We found linear polarization at the level of P = (1.17 +/- 0.16)% with
position angle (158 +/- 4) degrees (uncertanties are 1-sigma errors).

Once we also remove the effect of ISM in our Galaxy measuring the
polarization of field stars, the intrinsic polarization of the optical
transient turns out to be P = (0.80 +/- 0.16)% and P.A.= (144 +/- 6)
degrees.

The detected polarization level is significantly lower (~6 sigma) than
the previous one measured by Barth et al. (GCN 1477) at UT 13.31 while
the position angle remains constant to within the errors.

This is therefore the most significant and larger degree of variability
ever detected in the polarization level of a GRB optical afterglow and
confirms that the detected polarization is related to the afterglow
emission and not induced by intervening matter.

Such a degree of variability is predicted in current models for beamed
afterglows (Ghisellini & Lazzati, 1999, MNRAS, 309, L7) and allows us to
predict that the jet break occurred ~one day after the GRB event.
According to these models, the polarization angle should then rotate by
90 degrees and reach a peak up to ~10% around Aug 17.0 UT. Further
polarization measurements are strongly urged to test such models.
