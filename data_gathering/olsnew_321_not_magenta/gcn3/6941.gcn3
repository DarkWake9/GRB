P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and  D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the Swift burst GRB 0701018 (GCN#6932) using the VLA
at a frequency of 8.46 GHz and starting at 12.38 UT on Oct 19, 2007. We do
not detect any radio  emission within BAT error box (GCN#6933).
We also do not detect any radio emission at the positions of the two new 
sources
found by the TNT 0.8m telescope at Xinglong Observatory (GCN#6936).
The map noise is 31 uJy.
