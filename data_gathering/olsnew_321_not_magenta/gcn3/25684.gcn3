We observed the position of ZTF19abvizsw/AT2019pim (Kool et al., GCN 25616) with the AMI Large Array at 15GHz. Initially reported as a potential counterpart to S190901ap, ZTF19abvizsw/AT2019pim has been shown to be an unrelated transient. We started observing on 5th September 2019 at 15:40:41UT. A 4hr observation showed a point source at the phase centre with a flux of 404 +/- 10 uJy/beam. The rms noise in the field is 30uJy. There are two 2MASS sources within the AMI clean beam (~40"x20").


We thank the MRAO staff for scheduling these observations.
