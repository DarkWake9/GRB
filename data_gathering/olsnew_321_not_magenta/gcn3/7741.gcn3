R. Filgas (Tautenburg), A. Kupcu-Yoldas, J. Greiner (MPE Garching),
A. Rossi, S. Klose (Tautenburg), A. Yoldas, T. Kruehler (MPE), and
G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ. Budapest and MPE)
report on behalf of the GROND team:


We observed again the field of GRB 080516 (Holland et al. 2008, GCN 7733)
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK using the multi-channel imager GROND. 
Observations started on May 16, 22:52 UT (22.5 hours after the burst) 
and lasted for 90 minutes.

The faint source reported in our previous circular (Filgas et al., GCN 
7740) is not detected anymore. We estimate that the source has faded by at 
least 1 magnitude. Therefore, we conclude that this was the GRB afterglow.
