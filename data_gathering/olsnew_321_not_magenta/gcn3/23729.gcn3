P. D'Avanzo, S.Covino, D. Fugazza, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), on behalf of the REM team, report:

We observed the field of GRB 190114C (Gropp et al., GCN 23688) with the REM 60cm robotic telescope located 
at the ESO premise of La Silla (Chile). The observations were performed starting on 2019 January 15 at 00:47:35 UT 
(i.e. about 3.8 hours after the burst) and were carried in the g, r, i, z, J, H and K bands. 

From preliminary photometry, for the optical/NIR afterglow (Tyurina et al., GCN 23690; Lipunov et al. GCN 23693; 
Selsing et al., GCN 23695; Izzo et al. GCN 23699; Bolmer et al. GCN 23702; Castro-Tirado et al., GCN 23708; 
Kann et al. GCN 23710; Im et al., GCN 23717; Siegel et al. GCN 23725) we estimate the following magnitudes:

r = 18.6 +/- 0.2
H = 16.7 +/- 0.1

(AB; calibrated against the pan-STARRS and the 2MASS catalogues), at a mean time of about 4.3 hours after the GRB.
