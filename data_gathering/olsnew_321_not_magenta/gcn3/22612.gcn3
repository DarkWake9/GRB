report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 01:54:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180407A (trigger=823001).  Swift could not slew to the
location due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 35.241, +33.499 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 20m 58s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 29' 56"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex structure
structure with a duration of about 70 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 12:55 UT on 2018 June 19. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Deich (aud375 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
