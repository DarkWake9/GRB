S. Barthelmy (GSFC), C. Markwardt (GSFC/UMD),  and N. Gehrels (GSFC) 
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

As part of the several incremental steps of returning to normal
operations for the Swift mission, the distribution of the BAT-based
notices has been re-enabled for autonomous real-time distribution.
This includes the BAT_Position, BAT_Lightcurve, and Swift_FOM_Observe
notices.  Since the automated target slewing has not yet been enabled,
the Swift_SC_Slew notices are still being blocked (as are the XRT and
UVOT notices).

The position error quoted in the BAT_Position notice has been changed
from the fixed value of 3 arcmin radius  to 4 arcmin plus a term
which is proportional to the off-axis angle in BAT instrument coordinates.
This is to accomodate an increase in the systematic error due
to an as yet uncalibrated uncertainty in the Roll axis of the
Swift spacecraft.
