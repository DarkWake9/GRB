Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180624A (trigger #844192)
(Gibson et al., GCN Circ. 22832).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 318.096, -2.356 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  21h 12m 22.9s
  Dec(J2000) = -02d 21' 21.0"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 47%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked light curve that starts
at ~T-60 s and ends at ~T+540 s. The largest peak occurs at ~T+7 s. The
burst went out of the BAT FOV at ~T+720 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 486.4 +- 38.5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-60.61 to T+541.80 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.91 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
