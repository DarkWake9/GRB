On December 11, Konus-Wind detected in the waiting mode a short spike at 
06:12:58 UT, ~120 s before the BATSS GRB 081211B (Copete et al., GCN 
8661). The burst was seen as a single 2.9s-long spike in the G1 (20-70 
keV) and G2 (70-300 keV) bands. The BAT also detected this burst at 
06:12:55.1 UT as a weak single pulse that did not produce a significant 
on-board image. The BATSS position of GRB 081211B was 1.3% coded in the 
BAT at the time of this burst.
The measured propagation time delay from Swift to Wind as well as the 
K-W ecliptic latitude response for a short spike are consistent with the 
position of GRB 081211B. Hence, taking in account that the BATSS 
GRB081211B light curve shape suggests that it is possibly the tail end 
of the prompt emission of a burst (Copete et al., GCN 8661), we believe 
that the short spike detected by Konus-Wind and BAT is the main burst 
(likely short), followed by a long tail (extended emission) seen as the 
BATSS GRB081211B.
There is a hint of the extended emission in the K-W G1 and G2 bands.
