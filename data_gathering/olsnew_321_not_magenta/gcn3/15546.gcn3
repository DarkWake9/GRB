on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

K. Hurley on behalf of the IPN team, report:

The short-duration, hard spectrum GRB 131125A has been observed by Fermi 
(GBM: trigger 407089974), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and Konus-Wind, so far, at 
about 59571 s UT (16:32:51).

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   114.675 (07h 38m 42s) +48.414 (+48d 24' 49")
  Corners:
   114.485 (07h 37m 56s) +45.684 (+45d 41' 01")
   115.166 (07h 40m 40s) +45.939 (+45d 56' 21")
   114.817 (07h 39m 16s) +51.137 (+51d 08' 15")
   114.077 (07h 36m 18s) +50.873 (+50d 52' 22")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2.5  sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 5.5 deg (the minimum one is 29 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 130 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
