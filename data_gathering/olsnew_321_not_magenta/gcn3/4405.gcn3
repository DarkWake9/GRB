J. P. Halpern & S. Tyagi (Columbia U.) report on behalf of the
MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We are observing the Swift XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN 4402)
of GRB 051227 in the SDSS r filter with RETROCAM on the MDM 2.4m,
a medium-sized telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona.  Beginning on
Dec. 28 03:55 UT, or 9.9 hours after the burst, our first 15 minutes
of exposure yields no detection to a limit R > 23, referenced to the
SDSS photometry in the field (Cool et al., GCN 4399)."
