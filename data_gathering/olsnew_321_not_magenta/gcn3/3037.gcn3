After further observations of GRB 050215B with the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical
Telescope (UVOT), we have identified a source near the position identified by
Tanvir, et al (GCN 3031).  The source was detected at a position of RA =
11:37:48.03 and Dec = +40:47:43.4 (J2000).  The UVOT alignment is not yet fully
calibrated, therefore, we estimate a systematic uncertainty of about +/-
1arcsecond in this position.  Reexamination of the early time UVOT observations
at this location are consistent with our previously reported findings of no
detected afterglow (Roming et al, GCN 3026).  The source was identified at a
magnitude of 21.7 by co-adding three V-band images which were taken 2.2-9.7
hours after the initial trigger.  Examination of V-band images taken after this
time reveal no reliable detections. We caution that the instrument is not yet
fully calibrated and that the magnitudes presented here may need to be refined.
