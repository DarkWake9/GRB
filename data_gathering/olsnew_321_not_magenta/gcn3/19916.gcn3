"At 16:10:11.39 UT on 12 September 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160912A (trigger 495389415 / 160912674).

This burst was also detected by the Swift BAT approximately
150 s after the Swift trigger time and reported as an x-ray flare
approximately 89 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position
(Cannizzo et al. 2016, GCN 19912). At the time of the Swift trigger,
the source was occulted by the Earth for Fermi.
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 48 s (10-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4 s to T0+42 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.48 +/- 0.03.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.1 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+8.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.6 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
