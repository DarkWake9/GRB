I. Mitrofanov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, A. Sanin, V. Tret'yakov and A.
Parshukov, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, report:

Mars Odyssey (GRS), Konus-Wind, and the Suzaku WAM observed this
burst at 31311 s.  It had a T90 of 0.8 s, a 20 keV - 3 MeV fluence
of ~5 x 10^-6 erg cm^-2, and a hard spectrum with an Epeak ~ 1 MeV.
Therefore we believe that this event falls into the short duration
class.  We have triangulated it to an 87 sq. arcmin. preliminary 
3 sigma error box whose coordinates are:

	  RA	  Dec
Center:  221.385 +54.568

Corners: 220.834 +54.187
         221.818 +54.825
         221.945 +54.947 
         220.956 +54.310

A Swift ToO observation of this error box has been scheduled.
Detailed spectral parameters are being derived and will be reported
later.
