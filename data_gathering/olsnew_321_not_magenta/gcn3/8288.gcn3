S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. Cummings (GSFC/ORAU), S. Immler (CRESST/GSFC/UMD)
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=325707) at 21:49:17 UT on 23 Sep 08,
(GCN 8285, Immler et al.), is not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source.
This trigger is probably due to a noisy detector and a chance
fluctuation in the image domain.
