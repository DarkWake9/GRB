"The BOOTES-IR 0.6m telescope, located at IAA-CSIC Observatorio 
de Sierra  Nevada in Granada (Spain), observed the SWIFT error 
box for GRB 060707 (Moretti et al. GCNC 5285). R-band observations
started at 01:20 UT(3:50 h after the burst, when it became 
observable from our location). A limiting R-band magnitude of ~20 
is derived for the afteglow at ~ 1:45 UT.

This message is quotable".
