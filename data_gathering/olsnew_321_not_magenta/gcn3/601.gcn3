K. Hurley, T. Cline, C. Kouveliotou, R. M. Kippen, E. Mazets, and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the Ulysses, NEAR, BATSE, and Konus GRB
teams, report:

Ulysses, NEAR, BATSE, and Konus observed GRB000307 (BATSE #8022) at
78647 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses, this burst had a 25-100 keV
fluence of ~10^-6 erg/cm^2 and a T90 duration of ~20 s.  We have
triangulated this burst to an ~60 sq. arcmin. error box whose center
and corners (3 sigma) are given by:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  5 h 56 m 18.73 s      7 o 56 '  30.94 "  (CENTER)
  5 h 55 m 50.22 s      7 o 54 '   9.95 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 56 m 24.70 s      8 o  1 '  14.01 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 56 m 12.77 s      7 o 51 '  47.82 "  (CORNER)
  5 h 56 m 47.32 s      7 o 58 '  52.45 "  (CORNER)

Some refinement to this position is possible.
