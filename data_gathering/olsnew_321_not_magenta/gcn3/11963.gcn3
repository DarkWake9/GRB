We observed the field of GRB 110422A (Mangano et al. GCN 11957) with the 3.6m
TNG equipped with the Dolores camera. Few sets of unfiltered images were acquired
starting on Apr 22.89 UT (i.e. ~5.7 hours after the burst event).

The optical afterglow (Elunko et al. GCN 11958; Gres et al. GCN 11960;  Xu et al.
GCN 11961, Moskvitin GCN 11962) is clearly detected in all our frames. The observed
magnitudes (calibrated with respect to the same star used in GCN 11961) are

  5.777      60.0    20.17   0.03
  5.934      60.0    20.24   0.05
  5.998      60.0    20.03   0.05
  8.052      60.0    20.24   0.04

Our observations, coupled with previous observations reported on GCNs imply a
power-law decay index for the optical afterglow of ~0.55.

Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the TNG staff for their support, in particular Massimo Cecconi
and Giovanni Mainella.
