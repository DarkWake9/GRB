TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  7596
SUBJECT: GRB 080413: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    08/04/13 06:42:02 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

J.P. Osborne, A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 176 s of overlapping XRT Photon Counting mode and UVOT
data for GRB 080413, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 287.29829, -27.67807 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 19h 09m 11.59s
Dec (J2000): -27d 40' 41.1"

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest position
can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position enhancement is
described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/Goad.pdf), the current algorithm is an
extension of this method.

This circular was automatically generated, and is an official product of the
Swift-XRT team.
