S. Dado [Technion], A. Dar [Technion] and A. De Rujula [CERN] report:

Taylor, Frail, Berger and Kulkarni [1] reported the discovery of a second
compact radio source in the afterglow of GRB 030329 at an angular distance
of 0.28 +\- 0.05 mas from the main source on day 51.3 after burst, which
was not resolved in their VLBI observations at other epochs. This
separation is "hyperluminal": the relative mean sky-projected-velocity is
> 19c. A transient strong rebrightening of the second radio source is
consistent with the reported "jitter"  first seen in observations of the
optical afterglow that began on day 51.75 (GCN 2224 [2], GCN 2259 [3]).
At that late time, the optical afterglow of GRB 030329/SN 2003dh is
expected to be dominated by the supernova. The spectroscopic resolution of
the afterglow into the individual contributions of the SN and GRB [2]
indicates that the GRB contribution rebrightened by a factor 2 or more.
An analogous rebrightening of the second radio source may explain why
it was resolved only on day 51.3.

The discovery [1] of a hyperluminal compact source may pin down the origin
of GRBs [5]. We encourage prompt and follow-up VLBI observations of XRFs.
In the cannonball model the source separation observed by Taylor et al. is
the expected one [5], and both GRBs and XRFs are produced by hyperluminal
plasmoids ejected in SN explosions. Relative to GRBs, XRFs are selectively
viewed at closer distances, and at viewing angles typically 3 times larger
[6]. This makes them very attractive targets for radio searches of the
expected hyperluminal motions, in particular promptly after the burst.
