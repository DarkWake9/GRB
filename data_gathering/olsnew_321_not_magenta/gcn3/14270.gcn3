V. Pelassa (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 23:47:25.57 UT on March 6 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130306A (trigger 384306448 / 130306991),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Siegel et al. 2013, GCN 14266)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GRB is observed at high angles to all GBM NaI detectors and the angle
from the LAT boresight is 166 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of 3 main peaks with a duration of about
60 s with a plateau starting about 20 s before trigger and a tail
extending to about 100s after trigger."
