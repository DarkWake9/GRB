Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201128A (trigger #1009679)
(Lien et al., GCN Circ. 28958).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 223.091, 26.716 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 52m 21.9s
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 42' 58.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 92%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about 30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.41 +- 3.22 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.44 to T+8.74 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.37 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.21 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
