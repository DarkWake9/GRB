M. Capalbi, M. Perri, L. Vetere (ASDC), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), J. 
Kennea and D. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the Swift XRT data from the first  seven orbits 
observation of GRB 060223 (Cummings et al. GCN 4813). We find an 
uncatalogued fading source at the following location:

RA(J2000) = 03h  40m  49.74s
Dec(J2000) = -17d  07'  48.0"

We estimate an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds  radius (90% containment). 
This position is 44 arcsec from the BAT position and 2.6 arcsec from the 
UVOT position given in GCN 4813.

The large flare in the first orbit makes determination of an afterglow 
slope and extrapolation of the flux unreliable, and we will have to wait 
for further data before an afterglow slope can be established.

A preliminary spectral fit to the Photon Counting mode data with an 
absorbed power law gives  a photon index of 1.9 ± 0.3 and NH  consistent 
with the Galactic value  (5.92E+20 cm^-2).

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
