D. Q. Lamb, D. York, J. Barentine, B. Ketzeback, J. Dembicky,
R. McMillan,  M. Nysewander and D. Reichart report on behalf of the ARC
and UNC GRB teams of the FUN GRB collaboration:

J-, H-, and K-band photometry of the optical afterglow (Peterson and
Price, GCN 1985) of GRB030329 (Vanderspek et al., GCN 1997) were
obtained using the ARC 3.5-m telescope and the GRIM II at APO, starting
at 4.712 UT and ending at 5.651 UT on March 30.  The measured J-band
magnitudes of the afterglow are given below:

                         ------------------------
                          UT            J
                         ------------------------
                         4.712   14.230 +/- 0.047
                         4.961   14.307 +/- 0.077
                         5.425   14.596 +/- 0.119
                         5.570   14.501 +/- 0.075
                         ------------------------


Assuming a model F(nu) ~ F_0 (nu/nu_0)^alpha, the spectral slope of the
flux from the J-band through the K-band at the time of the first cycle
of observations is alpha = - 0.8 +/- 0.1.
