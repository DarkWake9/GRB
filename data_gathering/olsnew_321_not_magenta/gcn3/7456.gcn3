A. Cucchiara & D. B. Fox (PSU) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Starting on 2008 March 18.49 UT we used the Marcario LRS spectrograph
on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (R ~ 230 ) to obtain one 1200s spectra
of the optical afterglow (Holland et al., GCN 7428) of GRB 080319B
(Racusin et al., GCN 7427).  The spectrum covers the wavelength range
4100 to 10,500 Angstrom.  We observe multiple metal absorption
features including the MgII doublet (2796, 2803 A) and MgI (2852 A) at
z ~ 0.937. We also detect lines at z ~ 0.760 (MnII 2576, MnII 2594 and
CaI 4227), z ~ 0.715 (MgII doublet) and z ~ 0.530 (NaI 5890,5896).
Our observations are consistent with the redshift and features
reported by Vreeswijk et al. (GCN 7444, 7451)."
