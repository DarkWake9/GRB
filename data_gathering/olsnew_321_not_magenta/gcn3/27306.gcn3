TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  27306
SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S200303ba: Retraction of GW compact binary merger candidate
DATE:    20/03/03 13:37:24 GMT
FROM:    Marco Drago at GSSI  <marco.drago@gssi.it>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S200303ba is no longer considered to be a candidate of
interest. The false alarm rate is close to the open public alert 
threshold and most of the
signal is coming from one detector whose data are largely glitchy due to 
bad weather
conditions. The preliminary and retraction GCN notices were not sent 
automatically
because of an issue with GCN broker subscriptions.
