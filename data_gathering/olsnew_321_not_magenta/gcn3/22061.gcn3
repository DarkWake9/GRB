We continued to observe the field of GRB 171027A (D'Avanzo et al., et al.,
GCN 22053) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/10 27.35 to
2017/10 27.53 UTC (0.04 to 4.24 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a
total of 2.82 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 1.18 hours exposure
in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

At late time, the source is only detected in the H-band, with H = 19.12 +/-
0.06.  This magnitude is calibrated relative to 2MASS and is in the AB
system, not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.
We measure a fade in the H-band flux in time as t^(-1.0+/-0.1).

Using all bands (see, Watson et al., GCN 22057), we find high A_V photo-z
solutions nearby (z<3.85, 90% conf.) and a high-z solution which assumes
A_V=0 (z=9+/-1).  We note that the XRT N_H constraints (D'Avanzo et al., et
al., GCN 22053) point toward the high A_V solution, although with low
statistical significance.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
