TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  8416
SUBJECT: GRB 081024B: Swift-XRT further observations

C. Guidorzi and R. Margutti (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift re-observed the field of the Fermi-LAT GRB 081024B (Omodei et
al., GCN Circ. 8407) 127 ks after the burst. From 13.5 ks of Photon
Counting mode data, we found that sources 1 and 3 mentioned in our
previous report (Guidorzi et al. GCN Circ. 8410) are still detected
with a count rate compatible with being constant between the two
observations. Although source 2 is no longer detected, we estimate
that the fading is not statistically significant yet.
Further data will allow us to determine the possible fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
