E. Bissaldi (Politecnico and INFN Bari), C. Malacaria (NASA-MSFC/USRA)
and C. Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:47:45.18 UT on 20 October 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 201020A (trigger 624865670 / 201020241),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Ambrosi et al. 2020, GCN 28696).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 66 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single emission episode
with a duration (T90) of about 22 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10.2s to T0+10.2 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.83 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.47 +/- 0.17)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-3.6 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.48 +/- 0.14 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
