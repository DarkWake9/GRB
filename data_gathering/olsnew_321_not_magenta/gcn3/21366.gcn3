report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

During the commissioning phase, at 2017-07-26T19:02:59.51 (T0),
Insight-HXMT detected GRB 170726A (trigger ID: HEB170726793)
in a routine search of the data, which was also observed by
SPI-ACS (trig time: 2017-07-26T19:02:59.51) and
Fermi/GBM (trig time: 2017-07-26T19:02:59.976).

The Insight-HXMT light curve mainly consists of multi-pulses
with a duration (T90) of 23.7 s measured from T0-5.47 s.
The 1-second peak rate, measured from T0+2 s, is 1364.9 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 10261.5 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-8 s to T0+18 s is
adequately fit by a Power Law model with spectral index = -1.94 +/- 0.05.
The energy fluence is (7.17 +/- 0.38)E-06 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 3000 keV
in this time interval.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
