D.W. Fox and P.A. Price (Caltech) report:  

"We have observed the full WXM error box of the GRB021104 (HETE #2434)
with the Oschin 48-inch telescope + unfiltered NEAT camera, with our
first observations occurring at 09:49 UT, 2:48 after the burst.
Visual comparison of our earliest individual exposures with archival
(DSS-2) images reveals several asteroids but no new stationary objects
within the error box.

Image-differencing analysis of the summed image from two sets of
(3x120s) triplet exposures, the first with mean epoch 10:12 UT and the
second with mean epoch 12:37 UT, also fails to reveal any variable
sources that are not present in archival images.  

We estimate the limiting R-band magnitude of each of these two
unfiltered searches to be R >~ 21 mag."
