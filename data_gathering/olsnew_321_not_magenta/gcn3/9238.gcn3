C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), D. Bersier (Liverpool JMU),
and N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) on behalf of a larger
collaboration report:

We began observing the field of GRB 090424 (Cannizzo et al.
GCN Circ. 9223) with the 2-m Liverpool Telescope at
21:29:47 UT. We clearly detect the optical afterglow
(Cannizzo et al. GCN Circ 9223; Yuan et al. GCN Circ. 9224;
Xin et al. GCN Circ. 9225; Schady et al. GCN Circ. 9234;
Gorosabel et al. GCN Circ. 9236) with r'=19.93 ± 0.03
at a mid epoch of 7.55 hrs post burst from a 6x300 s coadded
exposure. Calibration was performed with respect to nearby
SDSS field stars.
