At 12:45:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130315A (trigger=551126).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 157.542, -51.810 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 30m 10s
   Dec(J2000) = -51d 48' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks
with a total duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1100 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~10 sec after the trigger. 
There is a possible flare at T+160 sec. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:48:13.7 UT, 160.7 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 157.54648, -51.79244 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 10h 30m 11.16s
   Dec(J2000) = -51d 47' 32.8"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 63 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.27
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.10e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 171 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.36. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is P. A. Evans (pae9 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
