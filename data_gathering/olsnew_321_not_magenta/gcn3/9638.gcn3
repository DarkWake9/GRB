GRB 090709A: Wyoming Infrared Observatory NIR upper limits

Jay Norris (U. Denver),
Jerry Bonnell (CRESST/UMCP/GSFC),
Tzitlaly Barajas (Los Angeles City College),
Amanda McAuley (Cal State U. Los Angeles)
report on behalf of the Goddard/Univ. Wyoming NIR camera collaboration.

We observed the Swift XRT position reported by Morris et al. (GCN
Circ. 9625) for GRB 090709A with the 2.3-meter WIRO telescope and
the Goddard IR camera starting 52 minutes after the Swift trigger.

Using stacked J- and K- band exposures begining at 08:30 UT, we
derive the following 2 sigma upper limits for the afterglow source
reported by Morgan et al. (GCN Circ. 9635) from PAIRITEL observations.

       Tmid (UT)    Mag

        09:30      J-band > 21.5
        09:55      K-band > 18.5

The source is designated source B in the Subaru K-band finder chart
from Aoki et al. (GCN Circ. 9634).

Our K-band observations were compromised by cirrus. Our upper limits
are derived based on a comparison with two field stars with J-band
magnitudes 14.5 and 15.7 in the 2MASS catalog.

Further analysis of J- and K-band images is ongoing.
