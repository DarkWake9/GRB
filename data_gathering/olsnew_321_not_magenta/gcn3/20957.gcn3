The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170318B (Cholden-Brown et al., GCN 20908) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 19.11, Mar 21.17 and 
Mar 23.24 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Goad 
et al., GCN 20910), with 3sigma upper limits of 300 uJy, 150 uJy and 315 
uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
