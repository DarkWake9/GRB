report on behalf of the NOAO GRB collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 050315 (GCN 3094) with the MOSAIC II
wide-field camera on the CTIO 4m Blanco telescope, starting 0.47d after
the burst.

The afterglow seen in the optical and radio (GCNs 3100, 3101 and 3102)
is well detected in our I-band data, taken at a mean time of 0.484d
after the burst.  A preliminary reduction, using an average zero point
for this camera, yields mI=20.7.
