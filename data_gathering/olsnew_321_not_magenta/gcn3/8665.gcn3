M. S. Briggs (UAH) and A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) report
on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 16:18:46.94 UT on 7 December 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 081207 (trigger 250359527 / 081207680).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 119.2, DEC = +66.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 7h57m, +66d54'),
with an uncertainty of 1.6 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi LAT
boresight is 56 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one pulse with a duration (T90) of about
153 s (10-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+9.2s to T0+66.6s
is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 639 +/- 42 keV,
alpha = -0.65 +/- 0.03, and beta = -2.41 +/- 0.17. The event fluence
(10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.06 +/- 0.2)E-4 erg/cm^2.

The spectral and timing analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
