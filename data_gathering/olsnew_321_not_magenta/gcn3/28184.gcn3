The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:35:46 UT on 1 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200801B (trigger 617988951.753576 / 200801650).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 70.5, Dec = -33.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 42m, -33d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 38.0 degrees.
