The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:17:38 UT on 17 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191117B (trigger 595696663.360798 / 191117637).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 156.1, Dec = 11.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 24m, 11d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54.0 degrees.
