team report:

The long GRB 140423A (Swift-BAT trigger #596901: Sonbas, et al., GCN 
Circ. 16142, Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 16161) was detected by 
Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single episode started at ~T0(BAT)-46 s 
with a duration of ~130 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of 
1.87(-0.17,+0.13)x10^-5 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(BAT)-46 s
to T0(BAT)+84 s) by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1, and Ep = 196(-20,+30) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
