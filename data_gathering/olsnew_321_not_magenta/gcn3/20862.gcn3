We report results of photometric observations and possible 
classifications of the bright SN PS17yt, PS orphan sources PS17lk, 
PS17nv, PS17qk, PS17pv, PS17rc and MASTER J090737.22+611200.5 in the 
field of the LIGO G270580 localizations (LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
GCN 20486). Observations were conducted using telescopes/observatories 
AZT-33IK/Mondy, Zeiss-1000/TSHAO, ZTSh2.6/CrAO, AS-32/AbAO, ZTA2.6/BAO 
and Zeiss-1000/Koshka.

PS17lk RA   09 29 58.27 Dec +15 11 58.5

We observed the source PS17lk (Huber et al., GCN 20518) taking 6 
observational sets in different epochs between Jan 25 and Feb 18. All 
observations were performed with filter R. We clearly detected the 
source in all but one epochs. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-02-18 R 57802.73167 21.89 0.24

The source is not detected in any SDSS frames up to the limit of r~23.1, 
i~22.8. Also there is no any source  in the SDSS stacked ugriz frame. We 
should note, that PS17lk is located near the ecliptic plane (ecliptic 
coordinates lambda = 139.955198 deg, beta = 0.391980 deg). Upper limit 
on possible proper motion of the source during 25 days of observations 
is 0.6 arcsec.

===============

PS17nv   09 57 41.01  +17 49 33.4

We observed the localization of the source PS17nv (Huber et al., GCN 
20518) taking 3 observational sets in different nights between Jan 25 
and Jan 31. All observations were performed with filter R. We did not 
detect any source no one night. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS 
stars.

Observations

2017-01-25 R 57778.74557 >22.2
2017-01-27 R 57780.82339 >22.2
2017-01-31 R 57784.03700 >23.4

The source is not detected in any SDSS frames up to the limit of r~23.0, 
i~22.4. Also there is no any source in the SDSS stacked ugriz frame. The 
source is not detected neither before the discovery (SDSS frames), nor a 
few days after (our observational epochs). The PS17nv is located near 
the ecliptic plane (ecliptic coordinates lambda = 145.362711 deg, beta = 
5.060578 deg) and might be an uncataloged asteroid.

===============

PS17pv   09 25 07.35  +50 12 28.9

We observed the source PS17pv (Huber et al., GCN 20518) taking 3 
observational sets in different epochs between Jan 25 and Jan 30. All 
observations were performed with filter R. We detected the source only 
on Jan 30. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-01-30 R 57783.80134 20.74 0.11

The source is not detected in any SDSS frames up to the limit of r~23.1, 
i~22.5. Also there is no any source in the SDSS stacked ugriz frame.

===============

PS17qk   09 29 12.15  +25 49 06.4

We observed the source PS17qk (Huber et al., GCN 20518) taking 8 
observational sets in different epochs between Jan 25 and Feb 18. We 
performed observations with filter R and in one case in filter B. We 
clearly detected the source in all our observations. The photometry is 
based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.

2017-03-06 CR 57818.86623 20.53 0.09

There is no data for this region in the SDSS latest release. We did not 
find any source at the position in the archival DSS2 B and R plates up 
to B~21.0, R~20.5. B-R magnitude for the source is ~0.4 mag at the epoch 
Jan 31 (MJD = 57784.8). The source is unlikely a Supernova.

===============

PS17rc  09 32 19.16 +47 03 38.3

We observed the source PS17rc (Huber et al., GCN 20518) taking 5 
observational sets in different epochs between Jan 25 and Feb 1. We 
performed observations with filter R and in one case in filter B. We 
clearly detected the source in all epochs. The photometry is based on 
nearby SDSS stars.

2017-02-01 R 57785.80742 21.28 0.09

The source is not detected in any SDSS  frames as well as in stacked 
ugriz. In our observations the source is red: B-R color is ~2.3 mag at 
the epoch of 2017-01-3 (MJD = 57784.9). It might be a SN well after 
maximum and not related to the LIGO G270580.

===============

We observed the bright SN PS17yt (Chambers et al., GCN 20512; Huber et 
al., GCN 20518) between Jan. 24 and Mar. 08 in BVR filters. We clearly 
detected the source in all epochs. The preliminary light curve of the SN 
may be found at http://grb.rssi.ru/PS17yt/PS17yt_lc_v7.png

The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

The observed maximum of the SN in B-filter is approximately at the epoch 
MJD = 57788 (B=18.09 +/-0.05 at MJD=57789.74,  not corrected for Galaxy 
extinction).

Riess et al. (1999, AJ 118, 2668) found that for low-redshift SNs Ia the 
average rise time is t_r = 19.98 +/- 0.15 days in the rest frame for 
B-band light curve. Taking into account the low redshift of the SN 
PS17yt z = 0.067 (Chambers et al., GCN 20512; Malesani GCN 20527), we 
may conclude that the time of the SN explosion could be at MJD = 57767 - 
57768, i.e. Jan. 14-15, and most probably not related to the LIGO G270580.

===============

MASTER OT J090737.22+611200.5   09 07 37.22 +61 12 00.5

We observed the source MASTER OT J090737.22+611200.5 (Lipunov et al.. 
LVC 20488) taking 3 observational sets in different epochs between Jan 
21 and 23. We performed observations with filter R. We clearly detected 
the source in all epochs. The photometry is based on nearby SDSS stars.

2017-01-23 R 57776.63227 19.18 0.03

The source is coincident with the SDSS QSO J090737.15+611200.7 (r = 
19.75 +/- 0.02) with the redshift z = 3.751227.
