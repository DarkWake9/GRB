P. U. Fynbo, and Jens Hjorth (DARK, NBI) report:

 From observations of GRB060218/SN 2006aj (Cusumano et al., GCN #4775)
with DFOSC on the Danish 1.5m telescope at La Silla/ESO we find that
the optical afterglow + SN 2006aj has brightened by 0.2 (+/- 0.01) mag
in R and 0.1 (+/- 0.02) mag in V from Feb 20.03 UT to Feb 21.03 UT. An
optical brightening is in line with the notion that the underlying SN
2006aj has still to reach its maximum, as noted in previous reports.
