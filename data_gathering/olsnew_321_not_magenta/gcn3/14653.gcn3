X-shooter GRB GTO collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 130515A (Malesani et al., GCN
14650) with the ESO VLT equipped with X-shooter.

In a 30-s acquisition image taken in the R band starting at 2:49 UT
(1.46 hr after the GRB), we detect a single source S1 consistent with
the best currently available XRT position
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/), at coordinates (J2000):

(S1)

RA = 18:53:45.82
Dec = -54:16:46.9

This source has a magnitude R ~ 21.2, and can be faintly glimpsed in
the DSS red. At the present time, we cannot assess its relation to the
GRB, though it may be the host galaxy.

We also note the presence of two further objects S2 and S3 just
outside the XRT error circle, which can also be seen in the DSS, at
coordinates:

(S1)
RA = 18:53:45.26
Dec = -54:16:44.3

(S2)
RA =  18:53:46.16
Dec = -54:16:41.1

We acknowledge excellent and prompt support from the observing staff
at Paranal, in particular Grant Tremblay.
