Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190611A (trigger #907950)
(D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 24785).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 324.689, -56.070 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 38m 45.3s
   Dec(J2000) = -56d 04' 12.6"
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 64%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
and peaks at ~T0, and ends at ~T+40 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 41.8 +- 30.6 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.9 to T+63.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.88 +- 0.54.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.6 +- 1.6 x 10^-7
erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.54 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
