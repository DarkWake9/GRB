Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 12:51:39.26 UT on the 2nd of November 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
 triggered and located GRB 141102A (trigger 436625502 / 141102536), which was also 
detected by Swift (Cummings 2014, GCN 17020). The GBM on-ground location, using 
the Fermi GBM trigger data, is consistent with the Swift location. The trigger resulted in
 an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was accepted and the spacecraft slewed
 to the GBM in-flight location. The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 57 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of two main peaks with a total duration (T90) of about
 2.62 s (50–300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0–0.064 s to T0+2.56 s is 
well fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law 
index is –0.85 +/- 0.12 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 770 +/- 243 keV.

The event fluence (10–1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.7 +/- 0.1)E–06 erg/cm^2. The
1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+1.1 s in the 10–1000 keV band is 
5.0 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will be published
 in the GBM GRB Catalog."
