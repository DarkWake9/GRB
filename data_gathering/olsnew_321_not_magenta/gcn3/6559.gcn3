report:

We observed the field of GRB 070610 (SWIFT J195509.6+261406) from MJD
54264.762 to MJD 54265.065, starting after 2.89 days of begining of
the burst (GCN 6489) using Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The
observing central frequency was 610 MHz with a bandwidth of 16MHz. The
radio afterglow of the GRB was not detected and the peak radio flux
density at the optical afterglow position, measured by 1.5m OSN
telescope (GCN 6501), was 300 +- 150 microJy.

We thank the staff of the GMRT that made these observations possible.
GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research.
