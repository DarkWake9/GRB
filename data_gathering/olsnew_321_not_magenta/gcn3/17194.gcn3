S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, 
D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

D. M. Smith, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, 

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

K. Yamaoka, M. Ohno, Y. Hanabata, Y. Fukazawa, T. Takahashi, M. Tashiro,
Y. Terada, T. Murakami, and K. Makishima on behalf of the Suzaku WAM team,

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on behalf of
the Swift-BAT team,

J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER NS GRB team, and 

V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, V. Pelassa, and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

GRB 141207A, initially reported by the Fermi LAT and GBM teams (GCN
17146, 17150), was also observed by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL SPI-ACS, Swift
BAT (outside the coded FoV), MESSENGER GRNS, RHESSI, and Suzaku WAM.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma annulus centered at
RA(2000), Dec(2000) = 73.658 deg (04h 54m 38s), +23.585 deg (+23d 35'04"), 
whose radius is 85.031 +/- 0.100 deg.  The XRT source reported in Evans, Page,
& Amaral-Rogers, GCN 17157, lies 0.003 degrees from the center line of this annulus, 
supporting the conclusion that this source is the GRB counterpart.
