and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

A. Goldstein, M. S. Briggs, and C. Wilson-Hodge
on behalf of the Fermi GBM team,

A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo,
and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team,

and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 190118A was detected by
Fermi (GBM; trigger 569543394), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT), at about 80990 s UT (22:29:50).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   232.423 (15h 29m 42s) +74.202 (+74d 12' 06")
  Corners:
   220.973 (14h 43m 54s) +89.312 (+89d 18' 44")
   263.843 (17h 35m 22s) +88.731 (+88d 43' 51")
   230.052 (15h 20m 13s) +55.646 (+55d 38' 46")
   228.831 (15h 15m 19s) +56.984 (+56d 59' 01")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 26.0 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 33.7 deg (the minimum one is 47.5 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 96 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
