D. Roberts, U. Kolb & M.Morrell (The Open University) reporting on behalf of the PIRATE group:


We observed 34 separate fields within the bayestar skymap of the LIGO/Virgo candidate G296853 using our 0.43m robotic telescope at Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Spain. We acquired over 768 images across 7 nights of observations, all images were obtained using the R filter and 60s exposure length. Initial observations began at 2017-08-10T02:24:29, approximately 17 hours after the initial GCN alert was received. A detailed list of all the fields observed can be found on GraceDB under the EMObservations tab. Preliminary analysis suggests no new transients were detected in any of the observing fields down to a limiting magnitude ~18. Further analysis is ongoing.
