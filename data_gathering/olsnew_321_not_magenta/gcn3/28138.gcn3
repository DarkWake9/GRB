We observed the field of GRB 200716C (Fermi GBM, GCN #28123; Ukwatta et 
al., GCN #28124) with the Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera 
(HFOSC) mounted on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (IAO, Hanle, 
India). Multiple frames (each 300 sec) of the GRB field in Bessell R and 
I bands were obtained under moderate sky conditions. Preliminary PSF 
photometry on the stacked images was performed and calibrated against 
USNO-B1 catalogue. The estimated magnitudes are listed below:

   DATE     | UT (mean) | Exposure | Filter |  Mag
2020-07-17   17:06:34     300x3        R     17.55 +/- 0.18
2020-07-17   17:23:33     300X3        I     17.19 +/- 0.15

Here, we caution that there is an extended object near the GRB location 
(possibly the host galaxy, D'Avanzo et al. GCN #28132). However, the 
extended source is fainter (~19.23 and ~18.67 mag in R and I bands, 
respectively, USNO-B1). Therefore, the estimated magnitudes likely 
belong to the OT candidate (Lipunov et al., GCN #28125; Hu et al., GCN 
#28126), affected by the host contamination.

We thank the staff at IAO and CREST for helping with the observations.
