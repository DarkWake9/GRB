The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:30:00 UT on 2 Sep 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220902A (trigger 683807405.374026 / 220902438).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 30.5, Dec = 40.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 01m, 40d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44.0 degrees.
