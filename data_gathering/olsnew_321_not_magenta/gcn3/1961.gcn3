A. Klotz, J.L. Atteia, M. Boer communicate:
The TAROT robotic observatory reacted within seconds
to the HETE trigger H 2641 = GRB 030324.

The images started at 3h13m10.75s UT,  
3 seconds after the GCN notice and 27.95s after the trigger.

The first 30s image, taken between 27.95s and 57.95s
after the trigger shows no OT with a limiting R magnitude of about 14.8.

Seven images were co-added, taken between 27.95s and 252.2s after the GRB. 
The co-added image shows no OT with a limiting R magnitude about 15.2.

The limiting magnitude of TAROT images are lower than usual
because the hour angle motion of the telescope was 
inopportunely stopped during images.
This acquisition mode allows to record time resolved 
flickering in case were OT is very bright, 
but it was not the case for this GRB.
