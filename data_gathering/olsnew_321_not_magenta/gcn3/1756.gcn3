Paul Vreeswijk (ESO), Ingunn Burud, Andrew Fruchter (STScI) & Andrew
Levan (U. of Leicester/STScI) report for the GRACE collaboration:

At Dec. 13.34, 2002 UT, the afterglow (Price & Fox, GCN 1733) of GRB
021211 (Crew et al., GCN 1734) was observed in spectroscopic mode with
FORS2 at unit 4 of the VLT at Paranal, Chile. The total exposure time
was 30 min., and the spectra approximately cover the wavelength range
4000-9500 A.

The combined spectrum (preliminary reduction) shows at least three
emission lines, presumably originating in the host galaxy of GRB
021211. We have identified these lines as [OII] 3727, and [OIII] 4959,
5007 at a redshift of z=0.800 +- 0.001. The equivalent width of the
[OII] 3727 emission is 37 +- 7 A rest-frame, which is fairly typical
for the hosts of GRBs.

We appreciate the kind assistance of the VLT staff at Paranal.
