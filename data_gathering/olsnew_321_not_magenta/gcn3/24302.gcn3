We report pre-detection forced photometry upper limits for the Swift/UVOT transient candidate (Breeveld et al., GCN 24296) from recent observations with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Forced photometry was performed on images processed through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al. 2019).

The candidate was detected with Swift/UVOT on 2019-04-26 at 18:49:22 UT (Breeveld et al., GCN 24296).  Thus, if associated with the gravitational wave event, the ZTF non-detections may constrain the rise time and temperature during the rise of the transient.
