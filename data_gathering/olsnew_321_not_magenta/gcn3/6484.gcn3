V. Rumyantsev,  D. Shakhovskoy  (CrAO),  V. Biryukov (CrAO, SAI MSU),
A. Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed error box of GRB070520 (Romano et al., GCN 6423) with AZT-11
(1.25m) and 1-m Zeiss (Simeiz) telescopes of CrAO  in R-band  on May 20 bet=
ween
(UT)19:50 and 22:00. No object is found in a refined XRT error box (Romano
et al., GCN 6427). Limiting magnitude of combined images is based on USNO
A2.0:

Mid time (UT),  Exposure,   R_Lim (3sigma), Telescope,  Seeing
May 20.896       6x300       21.6             AZT-11     3.6"
May 20.835      53x60        22.4             1-m Zeiss  1.5"
