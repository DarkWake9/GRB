Using the data set from T-120 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090129 (trigger #341504)
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN Circ. 8861).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 269.105, -32.793 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 56m 25.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -32d 47' 34.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 89%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows emission starting at ~T-30 sec,
then a large-amplitude FRED peak that returns to background at ~T+70 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 17.5 +- 2.7 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+27.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.88 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
