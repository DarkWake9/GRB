"At 08:09:26.47 UT on 16 April 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180416A (trigger 545558971 / 180416340).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is

RA = 113.65, Dec = -49.12 (J2000 degrees)

with an uncertainty of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 21 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple separated peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 103 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0+100 s is
adequately by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.19 +/- 0.02 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 153 +/- 4 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.61 +/- 0.05)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+87.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 22.2 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak = 145 +/- 5 keV, alpha = -1.16 +/- 0.02 and
beta = -2.89 +/- 0.26.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
