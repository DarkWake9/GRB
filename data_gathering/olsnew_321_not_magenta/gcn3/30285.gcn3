The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:44:03 UT on 21 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210621A (trigger 645965048.749786 / 210621447).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 248.3, Dec = -61.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 33m, -61d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 78.0 degrees.
