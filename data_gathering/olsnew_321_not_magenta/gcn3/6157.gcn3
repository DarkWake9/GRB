SUBJECT: GRB070227: possible X-ray afterglow detection

C. Pagani, D. Grupe, D.N. Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift/XRT 
Team:

The Swift BAT detected GRB 070227 at 22:21:59 UT (GCN 6156).  The Swift 
observatory did not slew promptly because a planned slew terminated the 
trigger prematurely. The burst was found later in ground analysis.
The XRT began taking data at 2007-02-28 13:51:31 UT, approximately 15 hours 
and 30 minutes after the trigger.  
In a preliminary data analysis of the first 2.6ks of PC data we detect an 
uncataloged X-ray source located at RA, Dec 120.5808 -46.3135 which is

RA(J2000)  =   08h 02m 19.4s
Dec(J2000) =  -46d 18' 48.7"

We estimate an uncertainty of 8 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 48 arcseconds from the BAT position (GCN 6156).
The source count rate is approximately 0.005 counts/s.
Observations are still underway and further ground analysis will be 
performed to determine if this X-ray source is fading.
