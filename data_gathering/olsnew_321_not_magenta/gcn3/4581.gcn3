Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060124 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 178750) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 1.98h after the GCN trigger.
The field elevation increased from
51 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We do not detected an OT source.
According to the limiting magnitude: R>18.5

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-A2 stars
