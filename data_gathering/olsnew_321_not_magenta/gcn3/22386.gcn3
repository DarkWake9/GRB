A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:25:25.39 UT on 05 February 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 180205A (trigger 539497530 / 180205184), 
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Evans et al. 2008, GCN 22381)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 94
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows several pulses with a duration (T90) of about 15 s
(50-300 keV).
The GBM detectors were turned off for SAA entry about 70 seconds after the
trigger. The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.048 s to T0+9.216 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. 
The power law index is -1.38 +/- 0.15 and the cutoff energy, 
parameterized as Epeak, is 85.0 +/- 14.4  keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.5 +/- 1.4)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.71204 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
