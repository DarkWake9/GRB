W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Konus-Wind and Mars Odyssey-HEND  observed this GRB at 26660 seconds on
14 November 2003.  As observed by Konus, it had a duration of
approximately 1.4 seconds, an 18-200 keV fluence of approximately
3.6E+-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately 6.3E-05 erg/cm2 s.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl
(2000) =  344.192, -8.447 degrees, whose radius is 70.299 +/-  0.036
degrees (3 sigma).   As the center line of this annulus passes 0.009
degrees from the position of SGR1806-20, and 0.092 degrees from the
center of the error circle of SGR1808-20, we conclude that the origin
of this burst was most likely SGR1806-20.
