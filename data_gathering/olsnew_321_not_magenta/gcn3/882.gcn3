GRB001109: BeppoSAX/NFI Observations

A BeppoSAX TOO observation (20 ksec) of GB001109 has started about 16
hours after the GRB.
Preliminary analysis of the first three orbits shown a
bright and unknown source in the MECS(1.6-10 keV) image.

The position is:

RA = 277.525
Delta = 55.309

The error radius is 1.5 arcminutes.

At this stage still we don't detect an unambiguous fading behaviour of
this X-ray source.
