W. Fong, B. A. Zauderer and E. Berger (Harvard) report:

"We observed the position of the short-duration GRB 130630B (Melandri
et al., GCN 14735) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
beginning on 2013 June 03.98 UT (7.6 hr post-burst) at a mean
frequency of 5.8 GHz. In 1 hour of observations, we detect a ~0.2 mJy
radio source in coincidence with the reported optical afterglow (Levan
et al., GCN 14742; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 14743; Foley et al.,
GCN 14745; Cucchiara et al., GCN 14748).

We note that this is only the fourth detection of radio emission from
a short GRB, of which one case (GRB 120804A; Berger et al., 2013, ApJ,
765, 121) was due to host galaxy emission.

Further observations are planned. We thank the VLA staff for quickly
executing these observations."
