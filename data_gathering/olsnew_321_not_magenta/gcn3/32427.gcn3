The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 16:20:39 UT on 28 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220728A (trigger 680718044.343708 / 220728681).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 5.4, Dec = 36.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 21m, 36d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 77.0 degrees.
