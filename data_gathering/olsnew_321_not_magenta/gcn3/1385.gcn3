on behalf of GRACE report:


Deep broad-band images of the NFI error box (GCN 1285 & 1348) and WFC
error box (GCN 1281 & 1284) of GRB 020321 were obtained with EFOSC at
the 3.6m telescope at ESO, La Silla.

The log of observations follows below:

Date (2000)	exposure	Filter	lim mag (3 sigma)
==========================================================
March 21/22	900 sec/each	UBVR	U=22.4 B=24.1 V=23.6 R=23.8
March 23/24	900 sec/each	  VR	V=23.7 R=23.6
April 18/19	1200 sec	   R	R=23.6

Magnitudes were calibrated by using the standard star WOLF 629 of the
Landolt catalogue, observed during the first night, which was photometric.

Very close to the position of the X-ray counterpart reported by in 't
Zand et al. (GCN 1348) we found two objects which are not present in the DSS,
with coordinates: 

Source	 RA(J2000)		 DEC(J000)	    error	
 A  	 16h 12m 44.1s, 	 -83d 43' 09.2"    0.5 arcsec
 B   	 16h 12m 44.4s, 	 -83d 43' 15.5"    2 arcsec 
X-ray    16h 12m 43.7s, 	 -83d 43' 13.9"    4 arcsec

Their magnitudes at the three epochs are:

(March 21.18102 BURST TRIGGER in BeppoSAX)

Epoch UT(2002)	Filter	 Source A	Source B

March 22.2814	R	20.81 +/-0.03	22.84 +/- 0.11
March 22.3179	V	21.43 +/-0.03	22.98 +/- 0.14

April 19.2908	R	20.93 +/-0.04	23.68 +/- 0.26

-------
Note: UTs are mid-exposure.

Both sources are extended. Source "A" does not appear in the DSS 2
(red), although it has a magnitude similar to other stars
that are barely visible in the DSS image. However, it does not show
any clear fading behaviour as would be expected from a GRB optical
afterglow.

Source "B" consists of two 'blobs', one of which disappears at epochs
2 and 3. The decrease in magnitude is too shallow for the usual
power-law behaviour of an afterglow: the index alpha would be ~0.2,
while for gamma-ray afterglows alpha is usually around 1. However,
this could be consistent with an OT superposed on its host-galaxy.

Images in V and R for the three epochs, as well as a light curve can
be found at http://zon.wins.uva.nl/~isabel/GRBs/GRB020321/grb020321.html
