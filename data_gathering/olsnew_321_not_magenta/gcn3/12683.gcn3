(YNAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 111215A (Oates et al., GCN 12681) at the
2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope equipped with YFOSC. Observations
started at 14:26:44 UT (i.e., 22.6 mins after the burst) and a series
of R-band images (totally 1700s exposure) were obtained in a seeing of
~2.8".

No optical source was detected within the XRT error circle (ref., GCN
12681) to a 3sigma limit of R~22.8 mag, calibrated with nearby USNO B1
stars.

The image trigger mode of this burst and the above R-band upper limit
might indicate high-redshift. NIR follow-ups are encouraged.

We thank the GMG staff, especially Y.-X. Xin, D.-Q. Wang, and Y.-D.  
Lang for performing the observations.
