K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and
T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 15:16:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 160419A (trigger=683383).  Swift did not slew to the
burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 16.424, -27.343 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 05m 42s
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 20' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single symmetric 
peak structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 01:44 UT on 2016 April 30. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. B. Markwardt (Craig.Markwardt AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
