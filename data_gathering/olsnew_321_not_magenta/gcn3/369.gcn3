Alain Maury (OCA), Boris Gaillard (OCA) and Michel Boer (CESR) report on
behalf of the OCA/CESR GRB collaboration : We have observed the field of
GRB990704 again tonight, and the 19th magnitude object announced
yesterday in GCN 363 as a possible optical counterpart is still visible
at the same position and roughly the same magnitude. This object is very
likely NOT the optical counterpart of GRB990704.
