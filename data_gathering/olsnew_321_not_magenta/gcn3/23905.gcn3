MASTER-Amur robotic telescope (Global MASTER-Net:http://observ.pereplet.ru,
Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L) located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State Pedagogical University)
  was pointed to the  GRB190219A (Beardmore et al. GCN 23902  Ttrig=19:38:58 UT)
  16 sec after notice time (55 sec after trigger time) at 2019-02-19 19:39:53 UT.

On our first (10s exposure)  set we don`t find optical transient  within 
SWIFT error-box (Evans et al. GCN 23903 12 38 30.33 +76 36 46.2   +-2.1arcsec).
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 16.2mag at 10-s first exposition, 
16.7m on the 30-sec.exp., started at 2019-02-19 19:41:28UT.

The galactic latitude b = 41 deg., longitude l = 124 deg.
The observations started on zenit distance = 28 deg.
The moon (100 % bright part) altitude was 32 deg.The distance between  moon and  object is 66deg.
The sun  altitude  was -28.1 deg.


MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, Kislovodsk Solar Station of Pulkovo observatory)
was pointed to the  GRB190219.82 21 sec after notice time (60 sec after trigger time)
at 2019-02-19 19:39:58 UT.
On our first (10s exposure) there is no new OT inside Swift XRT error box 
brighter than 16.5.

The observations started on zenit distance = 41 deg.
The sun  altitude  was -50.7 deg.


MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, SAI Crimea astronomical station)
was pointed to the  GRB190219.82 18 sec after notice time (57 sec after trigger time)
  at 2019-02-19 19:39:55 UT.
On our first (10s exposure)  there is no  optical transient  within SWIFT error-box .
with the 5-sigma upper limit  about 17.44mag

The observations started on zenit distance = 42 deg.
The sun  altitude  was -45.5 deg.


MASTER-IAC robotic telescope located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was 
pointed to the  GRB190219.82 20 sec after notice time  (59 sec after trigger time)
  at 2019-02-19 19:39:57 UT.
On our first (10s exposure)  set there is no optical transient  within SWIFT error-box 
with the 5-sigma upper limit  about 15.5

The observation started when error box altitude was 21deg.
Observations started at twilight.
The sun  altitude  was -9.9 deg.


MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope ocated in Russia (Applied Physics Institute, Irkutsk State University)
was pointed to the  GRB190219.82 29 sec after notice time (71 sec after trigger time)
at 2019-02-19 19:40:09 UT.

On our first (10s exposure) there is no optical transient  within SWIFT error-box
with the 5-sigma upper limit 15mag
The observations made on zenit distance = 25 deg.
The sun  altitude  is -40.6 deg.
