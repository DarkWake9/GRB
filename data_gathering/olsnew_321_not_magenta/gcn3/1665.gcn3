TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of a burst from SGR1900+14 on November 01, 2002

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Helicon-Coronas GRB
team, report:

Ulysses and Helicon observed this burst at 21837 s.  Based on the data
available so far, its duration (as observed by Helicon) was ~0.1 s and
its 25-100 keV fluence (as observed by Ulysses) was ~ 1.2E-6 erg/cm2.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA,
Decl(2000)=359.608, -35.426 degrees, whose radius is 81.708 +/- 0.032
degrees (3 sigma).  As the center line of this annulus passes within
0.018 degrees of SGR1900+14, we conclude that this burst originated
from that source.

Previous bursts from SGR1900+14 were observed by the IPN on October 10,
22 and 29 2002 (GCN 1643, 1655, 1664).
