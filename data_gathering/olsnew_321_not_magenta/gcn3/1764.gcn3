TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1764
SUBJECT: IPN detection of continued activity from SGR1806-20

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

V. Pal'shin, E. Mazets, and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Helicon-
Coronas GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Helicon  observed this burst at 40754 seconds.  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 0.25 seconds, a 25-100
keV fluence of approximately  6.4E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  7.4E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 3.003,  -36.081 degrees, whose radius is 78.796 +/-  0.034
degrees (3 sigma ).  As the center line of this annulus passes within
14" of the position of SGR1806-20, we conclude that it was the source
of this burst.  Prior to this, the last confirmed burst from this SGR
was on December 5 (GCN 1726).
