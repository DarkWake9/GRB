D. M. Palmer (LANL) and T. Sakamoto (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 04:59:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070714 (trigger=284856).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 57.854, +28.295 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 51m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = +28d 17' 43"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a duration of
3 seconds with a spike to a peak of 20000 counts/s (15-350 keV) 
at T+0.2 s. 

The XRT began observing the field at 05:00:30 UT, 61 seconds after the
BAT trigger. Using ground processed data, XRT found a bright, fading, 
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 57.8423, +28.2978 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 51m 22.1s
   Dec(J2000) =  28d 17' 52.0"
with an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). 
This location is 39 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position,
within the BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image
was 2.4e-09 erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

The UVOT began observing the field at 05:00:40.05 UT, 70.4 s after the
BAT trigger. No counterpart is apparent in the 2.7' x 2.7' subimage,
based on visual comparison with the DSS. Additional processing is
underway. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (racusin AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
