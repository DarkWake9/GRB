S. Piranomonte (INAF-OAR), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), D. Malesani (SISSA), F. Fiore
(INAF-OAR), G. Tagliaferri (INAF/OABr), G. Chincarini (Univ. Milano-Bicocca), L.
Stella (INAF-OAR), on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration, report: 

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB060926 detected by Swift (S.T. Holland
et al., GCN 5612) with ESO's Very Large Telescope UT2 (Kueyen) at Paranal,
Chile. We obtained three FORS1 spectra with a total exposure of 4800 seconds
starting approximately 8 hours after the burst, with the 300V grism and a 1"
slit, providing a wavelength coverage of 3800-8900.

We clearly detect a damped Ly alpha line and various other absorption features
such as Si II,Si IV, CIV at a redshift of z=3.20.

It's a pleasure to thank the excellent support of the Paranal staff,
and in particular that of Hugues Sana.
