D. Gotz (IASF Milano) S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), E.Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, M. Tuerler (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:
a long gamma ray burst lasting at least 60 s 0.8 s has been detected by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 07:17:26  UT of February 6th.
The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 145.3043  deg
DEC.= +66.7652  deg

with an uncertainty of 0.8 arcmin (90% c.l.). This position is consistent with the Swift/XRT one reported for the same event (Lien et al., GCN 15784).
The burst has been detected at the very beginning of the INTEGRAL orbit, just outside the radiation belts. Therefore the data are polluted by a high particle background, implying a high level of saturation of the IBIS/ISGRI telemetry. Hence no detailed information about the GRB duration can be derived at this stage. A preliminary lower limit on its fluence is 2x10e-6 erg/cmsq in the 20-200 keV energy band.
A plot of the light curve will  be posted at http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
