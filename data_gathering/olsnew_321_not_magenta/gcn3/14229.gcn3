Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130216A (trigger #548927)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 14223).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 67.901, 14.670 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 31m 36.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +14d 40' 10.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 54%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks.  There is an initial small peak
centered on ~T-6 sec with a duration of about 4 sec.  The second peak starts
at ~T-3 sec, peaks at ~T+2 sec, and ends at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 6.5 +- 1.1 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.16 to T+4.31 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.35 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.5 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
