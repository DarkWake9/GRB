A. Horesh (Weizmann Institute), A. Corsi (GWU), D. Perley (Caltech), B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), and A. Rubin (Weizmann Institute) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the transient iPTF14yb (Cenko et al.; GCN 15883; ATel #5924) with the JVLA and CARMA. 

The JVLA observations were undertaken on 2014 Feb 27.7 UT at center frequencies of 6 GHz (C band) and 22 GHz (K band). The JVLA observations resulted in a null-detection with 3-sigma upper limits of 45 microJy and 153 microJy in the C- and K-bands, respectively. 

The CARMA observation was carried out on 2014 Feb 28.5 UT at a center frequency of 95 GHz. We report a 3-sigma upper limit of 0.75 mJy. 

We thank the CARMA and the JVLA staff for scheduling this target of opportunity.
