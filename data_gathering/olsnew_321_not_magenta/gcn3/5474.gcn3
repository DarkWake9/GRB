TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5474
SUBJECT: GRB 060825: TAROT optical observations

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060825 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 226382) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 25.7s after the GRB trigger
(7.1s after the notice). The field elevation decreased from
77 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

Date of trigger : t0 = 2006-08-25T02:59:57.408

First image is 60.0 exposure trailed. No OT is visible:
t0+25.7s to t0+85.7s : R > 14.9

Second image is 30.0 exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+93.5s to t0+123.5s : R > 15.8

We co-added a series of exposures. No OT is visible:
t0+93.5s to t0+377.7s : R > 18.4

We do not detect the candidate of de Ugarte Postigo et al.
(GCNC 5472).

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=125.8970 lat= -6.9459
and the galactic extinction in R band is 0.7 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
