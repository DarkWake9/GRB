J. Mao, C. Guidorzi, R. Margutti (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift began observing the field of the Swift-BATSS GRB 081025 (Copete et
al., GCN Circ. 8409) 74.5 ks after the trigger. In 2.9 ks of Photon
Counting mode data, we detect a single uncatalogued source within the
BAT error circle at a position of RA, Dec = 245.36626, 60.47428,
which is equivalent to

RA(J2000):   16 21 27.90
Dec(J2000): +60 28 27.4

with an uncertainty of 6.7 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). The source
lies 125 arcsec from the BAT centroid and has a count rate of
~3e-3 counts/s during this observation.

It is not possible to determine whether this source is fading given the
current statistics.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
