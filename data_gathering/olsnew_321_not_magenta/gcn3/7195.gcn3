Swift XRT started a ToO observation of the INTEGRAL burst
GRB080120 at 19:47 UT. The analysis of the initial 1.5 ks
of data of the first orbit shows a single bright uncatologued
X-ray source in the field at

  RA (J2000):  15h 01m 03.13s
Dec (J2000): -10d 52' 31.8"

with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is
46 arcsec away from the GRB position given in Mereghetti et al., GCN
Circ. 7194. The source has a count rate of (2.1+-0.1)E-1 counts/s
and, assuming a Crab spectrum, a flux of 1E-10 erg/cm2/s. More
data are being collected that will be used to determine whether the
source is fading and to perform a spectral analysis.

This Circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
