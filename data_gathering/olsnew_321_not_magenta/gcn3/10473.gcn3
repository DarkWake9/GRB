A. Cucchiara (PSU),  report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"On March 5.42 UT we observed the field of GRB 100305A (Troja et
al., GCN 10470) with the Gemini-N telescope and the GMOS instrument.

In our 300s r'-band and 900s i'-band images we clearly detect
a source inside the XRT error circle at the following position:

RA (J2000) = 11:13:28.30
Dec (J2000) = 42:24:10.50

with an uncertainty of 0.5" in each coordinate.

Using 2 USNO-B1 stars we calibrated our photometry and obtained

r' = 23.95 +- 0.30 mag
i' = 23.71 +- 0.50 mag

At the moment no evidence of fading can be addressed.
Further analysis are in progress.

We thank the Gemini staff for performing this observation,
in particular Andrew Stephens."
