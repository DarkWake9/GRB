K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and S. Barthelmy, on behalf of
the GCN GRB team, report:

We have obtained a preliminary IPN annulus for GRB990510 (BeppoSAX GRB
ALERT GRB990510, BATSE 7560) using coarse time resolution BATSE/GCN and
Ulysses data.  The annulus is centered at RA(2000)= 144.801 degrees,
Decl(2000)=-7.236 degrees, and has a radius of 78.074 +/- 0.034 degrees
(3 sigma).  It intersects the BeppoSAX refined WFC error circle and
reduces its area.   The intersection defines an ~4' x 6 ' error box
whose corners are:

   RA(2000)              DEC(2000)
13 h 38 m 51 s     -80 o 31 ' 54 "
13 h 39 m 18 s     -80 o 29 ' 51 "
13 h 37 m 05 s     -80 o 31 ' 14 "
13 h 38 m 08 s     -80 o 26 ' 33 "

can be refined considerably.
