J. Mao, B.-L. Lun, and J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:




We observed the field of GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 31347) with the 2.4-meter optical

telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories again. The observation began at

UT 11:39:51, 2, Jan. 2022, about 30.5 hours after the trigger. We still clearly detected the

afterglow. The preliminary magnitude was measured to be R~20.1. We encourage the continued

follow-up observations.
