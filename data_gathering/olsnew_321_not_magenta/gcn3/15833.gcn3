Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:21:32.35 UT on February 13 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located  GRB 140213A (trigger 414012095/140213807), which was also
detected by Swift (Holland et al., GCN 15825). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift/XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 15827).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR) that was
accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location. The
pre-ARR angle from LAT boresight was 48.5 deg from the Swift/XRT
position.

The GBM light curve consists of a multiple-peak structure with a duration
of about 18.6 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+19 s
is well fit with a Band function parameterized as Epeak = 80 +/- 2 keV, 
alpha = -1.01 +/- 0.03 and beta=-2.41 +/-0.04. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) 
in this time interval is (2.04 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon 
flux measured starting from T0+6 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 37 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will
be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
