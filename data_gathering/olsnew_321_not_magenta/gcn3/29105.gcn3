SUBJECT: GRB 201221A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    20/12/21 18:56:51 GMT

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 2103 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT
images for GRB 201221A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 214.48016, -45.41620 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 14h 17m 55.24s
Dec (J2000): -45d 24' 58.3"

with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
