Robotic observations from the  0.6m BOOTES-IR telescope
in R and z bands started at 3:50 UT (3.25 hours after the
burst), as soon as the object became visible from the
observatory. No source is detected inside the XRT error
box.

We have observed the field of GRB 070429A with
the 4.2m WHT+LIRIS in J, H and K bands starting at
05:44:00 UT (4.148 hours after the burst). Preliminary
reduction of the K-band data shows a faint source at the
following coordinates (J2000 +/- 1"):

R.A.: 19:50:48.90
Dec.: -32:24:17.0

Further analysis to check variability and colour of this
source is ongoing.
