The Fermi-LAT detected GRB 131231A (Sonbas et al., GCN 15640;
Xu et al., GCN 15641) was monitored  with the 1.04m and 1.3m
telescopes at ARIES Nainital starting at 2014-01-01 13:15:13 (UT).
Several images in R_c and I_c pass-bands were obtained.

The optical afterglow was clearly detected in individual frames.
The preliminary photometry of the first R_c frame (exposure time
300 sec) yields afterglow magnitude to be 19.2+-0.1 mag.

The nearby USNO stars have been used for calibrate.
