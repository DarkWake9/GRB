TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and NEAR GRB
teams,  and D. Smith, on behalf of the RXTE ASM GRB team, report:

Ulysses and NEAR observed this burst (GCN #861).  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration ~5 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of
~3.2E-06 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 2.0E-06 erg/cm^2 s.
Using the RXTE ASM error box and the IPN annulus, we derive
an ~25 sq. armin. error box (3 sigma) whose coordinates are:

     RA(2000)         DEC(2000)
08 h 36 m 36.5 s  -13 o 04 ' 30 "  (CENTER)
08 h 36 m 41.9 s  -13 o 07 ' 00 "  (CORNER)
08 h 36 m 54.3 s  -13 o 05 ' 00 "  (CORNER)
08 h 36 m 30.5 s  -13 o 02 ' 00 "  (CORNER)
08 h 36 m 19.5 s  -13 o 04 ' 00 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
