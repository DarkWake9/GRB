Martin Jelinek, Jan Strobl and Ludek Rezba
(ASU CAS Ondrejov, CZ), report:

We observed the location of the GRB 200819A / Swift
J0125.7+6303 (Dichiara et al, GCNC 28263), with the
photometric camera of the 2m Perek telescope of Ondrejov
observatory in the Czech Republic.

The observations consisted of 20 x 120s dithered SDSS-z'
exposures, starting at 20:30:19 UT, with observation mean
time 5.08h after the initial trigger. There is no source
detected within the XRT errorbox (Evans et al, GCN28265), we
estimate the magnitude limit of our combined image as
z'>22.0
