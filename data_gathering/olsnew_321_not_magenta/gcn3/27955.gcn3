FROM:    Joshua Wood at MSFC/Fermi-GBM  <joshua.r.wood@nasa.gov>

J. Wood (NASA/MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

At the time of the neutrino candidate IceCube-200614A
(GCN 27941), Fermi was passing through the South Atlantic
Anomaly from 21 minutes prior to 4 minutes after the trigger
time; therefore the GBM detectors were disabled.
