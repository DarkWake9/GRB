TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  993
SUBJECT: GRB 010222
DATE:    01/02/26 20:36:28 GMT
FROM:    Tetsuharu Fuse at Subaru Telescope, NAOJ  <tetsu@subaru.naoj.org>

During our Edgeworth-Kuiper belt object survey using Subaru telescope
at Mauna Kea, we observed optical counterpart of the GRB 010222
detected by BeppoSAX using accurate coordinate reported by the Naval
Observatory. Roughly estimated R-band magnitude was 18.9 +/- 0.1 at
22.642 (UT) using following stars PG1528+062A, SA104 338, and SA104
339. Due to the lack of standard star around 22.508 (UT), we conducted
relative photometry and obtained 18.4 +/- 0.1 at 22.508 (UT). This
preliminary result suggests the shallow slope for the lightcurve of
GRB 010222. We would like to express our hearty thanks to URATA Yuji
at the Science University of Tokyo for helping us to estimate
appropriate exposure time.
