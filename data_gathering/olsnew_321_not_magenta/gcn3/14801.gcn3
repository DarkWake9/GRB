Subject: GRB 130606B: Fermi GBM observation

Hoi-Fung Yu (MPE)
reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:55:33.63 UT on 6 June 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130606B (trigger 392212536 / 130606497).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the LAT position
(Vianello et al., GCN 14795). The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
is 93 degrees.

The high peak flux from the GRB caused GBM to issue an autonomous
rapid repoint (ARR) maneuver but to an unreliable sky position 
according to the flight software calculation. 

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-peaked feature with a duration (T90)
of about 52 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.003 s
to T0+65.537 s is well fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 435 +/- 11 keV, alpha = -1.14 +/- 0.01, and
beta = -2.05 +/- 0.02.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.034 +/- 0.007)E-04 erg/cm^2. The 1.024 s peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.15 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 62.14 +/- 0.58 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
