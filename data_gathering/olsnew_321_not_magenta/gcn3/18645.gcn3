TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  18645
SUBJECT: GRB 151127A: GROND K-band upper limit
DATE:    15/11/27 13:01:13 GMT
FROM:    Jochen Greiner at MPI  <jcg@mpe.mpg.de>

T. Schweyer and J. Greiner (both MPE Garching) report on behalf of
the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 151127A (Swift trigger 665268; D'Ai et
al., GCN #18643) simultaneously in JHK with GROND (Greiner et al.
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG telescope at the ESO La
Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 09:12:30 UT on 2015-11-27, about 4 min after the 
GRB trigger. They were performed at an average seeing of 2" and at an 
average airmass of 2.3 during morning twilight, with the Sun at -6 deg. 
Due to the sky brightness, only the first two 1-min exposure K-band
images are useful.

We do not detect a source within the 2.6 arcsecond XRT error circle
(D'Ai et al., GCN #18643), down to a limiting magnitude of 
K(AB) > 16.5 mag.
