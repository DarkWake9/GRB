H. Mito, S. Nishiura, and Y. Urata on behalf of the Kiso GRB team:

"We imaged the field of GRB021211 (Crew et al., GCN 1734) using the
Kiso observatory (the University of Tokyo) 1.05m Schmidt telescope
starting at December 12.638 UT. We obtained 13 frames R-band images
with 300 sec exposure.  We could not detect significant emission at
the position of the optical afterglow of GRB021211 (Fox and Price, GCN
1731).  The limiting magnitude for a combined image is R~ 21 mag. (3
sigma, compared with USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes)."
