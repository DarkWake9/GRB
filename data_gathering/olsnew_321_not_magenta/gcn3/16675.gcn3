An optical source is visible where described by Shumkov et
al. (GCN 16674)  in 180-seconds integration images,
unfiltered. The position of the source is RA: 11 46 54.89
Decl.:+66 10 00.5 (J2000.0, mean residuals of 0.2") and the
magnitude was estimated to be 17.4 assuming R mags for the
reference stars from UCAC-4.
