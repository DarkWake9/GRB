report:


"Five R-band images of the BeppoSAX WFC error box of GRB991217/SAX
J2303.2+0015 (Muller et al. 1999,  GCN #474) were obtained with the
Bologna Astronomical Observatory 1.5-meter telescope equipped with BFOSC
between Dec. 17.727 and 17.814, for a total exposure time of 55 min.

These observations, which started about 13 hours after the high-energy
event, were summed together and compared with the DSS-2.
Altought somewhat deeper than the DSS-2, the summed R frame does not show
any remarkable new object."
