The long GRB 120316A (GBM trigger 353549464; Fermi-LAT detection:
Zheng & Akerlof, GCN 13070; IPN localization: Hurley at al., GCN 13073) 
was detected by the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 00:11:02 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starting at T0,
ending at T0+28 s with a duration (T90) of about 24 seconds. The
fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.79 (-0.49, +0.07) x 10^-5 erg/cm^2. The
1-s peak flux measured from T0+21 s was 2.75 (-1.02, +0.31)
photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from 
T0 to T0+28 s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.
the low-energy photon index alpha: -0.44 (-0.61, +0.89),
the high-energy photon index beta: -2.63 (-0.58, +0.31),
and the peak energy Epeak: 530 (-76, +89) keV (chi^2/d.o.f = 12.6/12).

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 3% systematic error was added
for low energy channels. All the quoted errors are at statistical 90%
confidence level.
