SUBJECT: GRB 060928: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow detected by Swift

K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of 
the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT performed a second observation of the IPN-discovered burst GRB 
060928 on 2006-10-07 starting at 01:17 (9 days after the trigger).

In a 10 ks observation, we no longer detect the source reported in GCN
Circ. 5686 (Page et al.) Thus, we confirm that this source [previously
reported to have a position of RA,Dec 08 30 29.90, -42 44 58.5 (J2000),
estimated uncertainty 6 arcsec radius] has faded from view. 

During this second observation, the 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate
is about 3e-3 count s^-1, corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) flux
of 2.1e-13 (4.9e-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1. Since the source has faded over time,
it is, indeed, believed to be the X-ray afterglow of GRB 060928.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
