S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, H. Enos, and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

A long-duration GRB 180223A was detected
by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Mars-Odyssey (HEND),
and Swift (BAT) at about 22171 s UT (06:09:31).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
    33.144 (02h 12m 35s) +40.407 (+40d 24' 25")
  Corners:
    32.485 (02h 09m 56s) +38.962 (+38d 57' 43")
    33.550 (02h 14m 12s) +42.132 (+42d 07' 57")
    33.877 (02h 15m 30s) +41.789 (+41d 47' 22")
    32.819 (02h 11m 16s) +38.591 (+38d 35' 28")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 1.1 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 3.6 deg (the minimum one is 19.8 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 71 deg.

This box may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN 
Circulars.
