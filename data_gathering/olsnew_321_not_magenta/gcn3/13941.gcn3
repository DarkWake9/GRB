K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift performed a follow-up observation of the possible X-ray afterglow of
MAXI-detected GRB 121025A (Asada et al., GCN Circ. 13895) announced in GCN
Circ. 13909 (Page, Starling & Evans). This second observation took place
on 2012-10-31, 5.8 days after the burst. The source has now faded by at
least an order of magnitude, with an upper limit on the count rate of
0.002 count s^-1 (corresponding to an observed flux of 8.1 x 10^-14 erg
cm^-2 s^-1). This source is therefore confirmed as the X-ray afterglow of
GRB 121025A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
