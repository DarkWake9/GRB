P. D'Avanzo, A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (INAF/OAR & ASI/ASDC), G. Mainella, W. Boschin (INAF-TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration: 

We observed the field of GRB 170714A (D'Ai et al. GCN 21340) with the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) equipped with NICS. Observations were carried out in the near-infrared with the J filter under poor weather conditions (clouds and calima). Observations started on Jul 16 at 04:05:03 UT (~1.65 days after the burst) and consisted in a series of images for a total exposure time of 17 minutes.

No source is detected in the refined XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN 21341). In particular we could not detect the candidate afterglow reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN. 21346). 

For the coadded image we estimate a preliminary 3sigma upper limit of J > 19.6 mag (AB, calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).
