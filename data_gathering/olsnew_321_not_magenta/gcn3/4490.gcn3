S. B. Cenko, A. M. Soderberg, E. Ofek (Caltech) and D. B. Fox (Penn State)
report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 060111(a) (Zane et al., GCN 4479) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of 9 x 180 s
exposures in the Kron R-band taken at a mean epoch of 13:19:49 11 January
UT (~ 8.9 hours after the burst trigger).

We find no sources in the revised XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN 4481)
or at the location of the proposed UVOT counterpart (Blustin, Zane, and
Rosen, GCN 4482).  The limiting magnitude of our observations, calculated
with respect to several Guide Star Catalog sources in the field, is R >
20.5.
