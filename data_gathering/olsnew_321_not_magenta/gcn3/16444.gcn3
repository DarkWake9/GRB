The long-duration GRB 140621A has been observed by Konus-Wind, Fermi(GBM 
trigger 425073013), Swift (BAT), Suzaku (WAM), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), 
so far, at about 71411 s UT (19:50:11). The burst was outside the coded 
field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-SPI-ACS annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=73.277 deg (04h 53m 07s)  Dec(2000)=+14.648 deg (+14d 38' 54"), 
whose radius is 46.161 ± 0.185 deg (3 sigma), and to a GBM-SPI-ACS 
annulus centered at RA(2000)=295.874 deg (19h 43m 30s) Dec(2000)=+52.624 
deg (+52d 37' 26"), whose radius is 73.043 ± 1.325 deg (3 sigma). These 
annuli intersect to form the error box whose  portion with declination 
lower than about 22.2 degrees is ruled out due to the BAT non-detection 
in the coded FoV.

The corners of the combined IPN+BAT box are:
   ---------------------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
   ---------------------------------------------
   Corners:
     24.883 (01h 39m 32s) +22.492 (+22d 29' 30")
     25.291 (01h 41m 10s) +22.804 (+22d 48' 16")
     25.278 (01h 41m 07s) +22.200 (+22d 12' 00")
     24.879 (01h 39m 31s) +22.200 (+22d 12' 00")
   ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is about 720 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 43 arcmin.

This box may be improved.

A triangulation map is posted at

A Swift ToO observation has been requested.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
