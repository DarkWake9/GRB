We observed a 25 x 25 arcmin area centered on the coordinates of the Swift
GRB 041217 (GCN 2853) with the 90prime instrument on the Steward
Observatory 90-inch Bok telescope.  Two 300s R-band images were obtained
beginning on Dec. 18 at 11:55:56 UT.  We do not find any new objects down
to the limiting magnitude of the DSS.
                                                                                
Further analysis and additional observations are planned.
