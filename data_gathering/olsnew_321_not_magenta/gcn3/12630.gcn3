TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  12630
SUBJECT: GRB 111205A:  Swift XRT Observations

FROM:    Erik Hoversten at Swift/Penn State  <hoversten@astro.psu.edu>

C. A. Wolf (PSU) and E. A. Hoversten (PSU) report on behalf of the  
Swift team:

We have analysed 5.0 ks of XRT data for the IPN-detected burst: GRB  
111205A
(Hurley et al.  GCN Circ. 12626), from 198.4 ks to 210.7 ks after the   
IPN trigger.
The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The XRT field-of- 
view does
not cover the entire IPN error region. However, an uncataloged X-ray  
source is
detected within the observed XRT field which is potentially the  
afterglow of
GRB 111205A. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 134.6793, -31.94327
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 08 58 43.03
Dec(J2000): -31 56 35.8

with an uncertainty of 4.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This  
position is inside
the IPN error box. We cannot determine at the present time whether the  
source is
fading.  A follow-up Swift observation is planned in several days to  
confirm fading
of the source.  The XRT position is outside of the UVOT field of  
view.  However,
archival DSS imaging reveals a faint optical source within the XRT  
error circle.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
