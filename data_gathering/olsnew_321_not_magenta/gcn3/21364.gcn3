report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:48:44 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170724A (trigger=764204).  Due to a Sun constraint, 
Swift did not slew to the burst location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 150.081, -1.048 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 10h 00m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = -01d 02' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for an image trigger, the
immediately-available lightcurve show no obvious variation. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 09:13 UT on 2017 October 11. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
