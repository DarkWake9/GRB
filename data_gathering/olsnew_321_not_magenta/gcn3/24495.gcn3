and the CALET collaboration:

The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) was operating at the 
trigger time of S190510g T0=2019/05/10 02:59:39.292 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24442, 
24448 and 24462).  

No CGBM on-board trigger occurred around the event time.  Based 
on the LIGO-Virgo localization sky map, most of the part of the high
probability area was outside of the field-of-view of CGBM.  The 
summed LIGO probabilities inside the HXM and the SGM field of
view are 2% and 7% (and 84% credible region of the updated
localization map were Earth-occulted).  The HXM and SGM field of
views were centered at RA=298.7 deg, Dec = 60.7 deg and
RA=295.7 deg, Dec=50.8 deg at T0.

Based on the analysis of the light curve data with 0.125 sec 
time resolution from T0-60 sec to T0+60 sec, we found no 
significant excess around the trigger time in either the 
HXM (7-3000 keV) or the SGM (40 keV -28 MeV) data. 

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger
mode at the trigger time of S190510g. Using CAL data, we have 
searched for gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band from 
-60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger time and found no
candidates.  There is no significant overlap with the LVC location 
probability map.  The CAL FOV was centered at RA=295.7 deg, 
Dec=50.8 deg at T0.
