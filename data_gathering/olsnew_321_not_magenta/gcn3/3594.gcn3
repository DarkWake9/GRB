Quick-Look-Analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of the
GRB 050713A field based on the EPIC PN exposure started
at 10:54:50 UT, shows the presence of a source with 
coodinates coincident with SWIFT/XRT coordinates 
(Falcone et al., GCN Circ. 3581). 
The average EPIC PN source count rate for the first 3ks was 
estimated to be 1.0 [counts/sec]
GRB 050713A is also detected with the RGS spectrometer.
