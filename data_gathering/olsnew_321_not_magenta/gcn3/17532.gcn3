A. Melandri (INAF/OAB) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:


Swift-XRT observed again the field of the IPN GRB 150220A (Hurley et al. GCN 17502; Roberts & Meegan GCN 17505). The observation started on 2015-02-27 at 14:41 UT, i.e. ~7 days after the burst detection.

For the three sources detected by Swift-XRT, reported in D'Elia et al. (GCN 17504) we did not find any evidence for fading. In particular:

Source 2:
  Epoch1: (6.8 +/- 1.9)e-3 ct s^-1
  Epoch2: <5.4e-3 ct s^-1 (3sigma upper limit)

Source 3:
  Epoch1: (4.7 +/- 1.7)e-3 ct s^-1
  Epoch2: <4.1e-3 ct s^-1 (3sigma upper limit)

Source 7:
  Epoch1: (3.3 +/- 1.7)e-3 ct s^-1
  Epoch2: <3.0e-3 ct s^-1 (3sigma upper limit)

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
