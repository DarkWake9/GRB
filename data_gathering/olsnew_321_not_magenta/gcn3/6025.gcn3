As observed by RHESSI, GRB070125 (Hurley et al., GCN 6024)
had a duration of ~70s starting at about T0=07:20:42 UT.
The preliminary fit to the time-integrated RHESSI spectrum from T0 -
T0+69s between 30 keV and 10 MeV is a cutoff power law with

alpha = -1.33 +0.11/-0.09
E0 = 1450. +710/-450. keV
Epeak = 980. +/-300. keV
(90% confidence levels).

The 30 keV-10 MeV fluence is 1.5 E-4 erg/cm^2.

The RHESSI data show two main periods of GRB emission.  The first, from T0
- T0+13s, had a fluence of 4.6 E-5 erg/cm^2 and an Epeak of 950 +/-300
keV.  A second, multi-peaked emission period occurred from T0+30s - T0+50s
and had a fluence of 7.2 E-5 erg/cm^2 and an Epeak of 675 +/-175 keV.
