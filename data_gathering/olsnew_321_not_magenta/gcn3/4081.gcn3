V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), V.Biryukov (SAI, MSU), and A.Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf
of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We have observed the GRB051008 error box (Marshall et al., GCN4069) with 2.6
m Shajn telescope of CrAO. The observation start on Oct. 8, 17:05:08 (UT),
i.e 38 minutes after the burst onset.  We found an optical source  within
XRT  error circle (Perri et al., GCN4073) which is not present in DSS2 (R):

RA(J2000) =13 31 29.98
Dec       =+42 05 52.06

Preliminary photometry against of USNO A2.0 is  R=21.4+-0.1.

Finding chart of the optical source can be found at

More detailed analysis and observations are in progress.
