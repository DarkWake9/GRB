We have analysed xx ks of XRT data for GRB 151228A (Ukwatta et al. GCN
Circ. 18731), from xx to 0 s after the	BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.	We cannot determine at the
present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
