Giangiacomo Gandolfi on behalf of BeppoSAX Mission Scientist reports:

Due to a trivial typo in coordinates conversion the reported WFC refined
position in BeppoSAX Mail 99/13 (GCN #361) is wrong.

The real position should be read:
RA(2000)= 184.873
DEC(2000)= -3.803

The error box radius is still about 7'.
