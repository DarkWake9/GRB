TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2352
SUBJECT: GRB 030817 = H2808 TAROT optical observations
DATE:    03/08/17 01:59:33 GMT
FROM:    Michel Boer at CESR-CNRS  <Michel.Boer@cesr.fr>

M. Boer, and A. Klotz, CESR/OMP/CNRS, communicate on behalf of the TAROT 
collaboration.

We imaged the 2 degree field of view centered around the position of HETE 
trigger 2808 (= GRB 030817) with the TAROT automatic instrument. The first 
observation starts at 0h25m25s UT on Aug. 17th, 2003, i.e. 57s after the GRB 
trigger on HETE. No new source was detected. Unfortunately the first image is 
heavily absorbed, and the limit for a new source is approximately R > 12. On 
an image taken latter, at 0h26m40s UT, the nebulosity lowered, and we reach a 
limit of R > 15. We note also that the GRB source is located at a low galactic 
latitude.
