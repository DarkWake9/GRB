A. C. Updike and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University) report on behalf of 
the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:


The .9m SARA telescope began imaging the field of GRB 061028 4 hours and 
51 minutes after the Swift Trigger 235715 at 01:26:22 UT.  Our initial 
observations were comprised of 180-second exposures in the I band.  
After stacking in sets of 5, we did not detect any new sources.  Our 
observations continued with 300-second exposures in the I band, 6 hours 
and 6 minutes after the trigger.  Based on a total of 25 minutes of 
stacked I-band exposures we conclude that the XRT error circle (GCN 
5762) does not contain a new or fading source to a limiting magnitude of 
I ~ 20.1 ± .4 mag (based on calibration of 10 field sources from USNO 
B1.0 I2 band).
