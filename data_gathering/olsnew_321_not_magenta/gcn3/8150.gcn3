SUBJECT: SGR 0501+4516: Decline in Activity

This is a duplicate of ATEL #1683 (which should be cited instead of  
this GCN) copied to GCN as a courtesy to the gamma-ray burst community.

David Palmer (LANL) on behalf of the Swift Team, reports:

SGR 0501+4516 (ATEL #1675, #1676, #1677, #1678, #1682) has declined in  
activity. There have been no reported bursts in 43 hours, compared to  
the previous period with 56 bursts in 87 hours and a largest gap of 8  
hours.

Due to the unpredictable nature of these objects, this does not  
necessarily imply that it has returned to a multi-year (or even multi- 
day) quiescent stage.

As of the latest available Swift-BAT data, 2008-08-27 22:40 UT, the  
most recent reported burst from the SGR was detected by Konus-Wind on  
2008-08-26 at 03:16:15 (Konus-Wind team, private communication).  The  
most recent BAT detection was about 8 hours earlier.

The current list of BAT bursts, plus the reported Konus Wind bursts  
(from GCN #8132), follows.  As in ATEL #1676, which this expands, the  
bursts with more than 2000 counts in the BAT are marked with a '*'.
