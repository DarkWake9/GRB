report on behalf of the Swift/XRT team:


We have analysed the first 10 orbits of X-ray data for GRB 060712 for
a total exposure time of 18 ks (up to ~14.5 h since the BAT trigger).

The PC light curve, from 300 s after the BAT trigger can be fitted
with a single powerlaw with decay index of 0.65 +/- 0.06.


The 0.3-10 keV PC spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power law
with photon index of 2.7 +/- 0.4 with an nH value of (1.6 +/-0.9)e21
cm^-2, greater than the Galactic value of 0.13e21 cm^-2.

The predicted unabsorbed flux at 24 hours after the BAT trigger is
6.8e-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.
