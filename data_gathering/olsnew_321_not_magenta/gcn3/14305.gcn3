B. P. Gompertz&  K. L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Continuing Swift observations of GRB 130313A (Gompertz et al., GCN Circ.
14293) have shown the X-ray source identified by Gompertz&  Page (GCN
Circ. 14297) and Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 14300) has faded. The first
snapshot of data contains 10 counts in 326 seconds, giving a count rate of
0.012 ± 0.004 count s^-1, while later data provide an upper limit of
0.0025 count s^-1, corresponding to a single count in 22 ks of data. The
souurce has faded and we therefore confirm that this is the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 130313A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
