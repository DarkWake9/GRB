We observed the field of GRB 160117B (Sonbas et al., GCN 18875; Evans et al., GCN 18883; 
Yurkov et al., GCN 18877; Kruehler et al., GCN 18878; Malesani et al., GCN 18884; 
Hentunen et al., GCN 18885) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T17 (Plane Wave CDK 0.43m) telescope located at the Siding Spring Observatory (Australia).  
A single image of 300 s was taken in the R filter, starting at 14:10:03 UT, 636 s 
after the GRB trigger. We detect the GRB optical afterglow candidate and obtain 
a photometry estimate of R = 17.523 +- 0.126 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
