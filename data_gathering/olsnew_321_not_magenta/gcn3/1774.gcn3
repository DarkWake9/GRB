E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"On December 20.03 UT we used the VLA at 4.86 GHz to observe the error box
of GRB 021219 (GCN 1766).  We detect a single radio source within the
refined IPN+INTEGRAL error region (GCN 1772), which is visible in the NRAO
VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693).  There are no
additional sources down to a 4-sigma limit of 220 microJy."
