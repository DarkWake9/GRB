M. Andreev (Institute of Astronomy), A. Pozanenko  (IKI)  on behalf of
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 060204C (Grupe et al., GCN 4663)  in R-band
with the 60 cm telescope of  peak Terskol observatory starting Feb. 04 (UT)
20:56.  Totally we obtained 27x60 s images in two epochs (UT) 20:56-21:10,
and  21:22-21:35. Within whole BAT error circle in a combined image we found
an object which is marginally visible in DSS2(R) and not presented in
USNO-B1.0; coordinates of the object are   (J2000) RA= 06h 10m 38.4s  Dec=
+70 09 32.4 with uncertainty in both coordinates of  about 0.1".  Brightness
of the object is measured in the combined image is R=19.2 +/-0.1. The object
is not variable between the two epochs within error bars.  The astrometry
and photometry calibration is based on USNO-B1.0.

While the object is not variable between our epochs and marginally visible
in DSS2(R) and detected better in DSS2(I), the object may be a host galaxy
of GRB060204C if fading brightness of the object will be confirmed.
