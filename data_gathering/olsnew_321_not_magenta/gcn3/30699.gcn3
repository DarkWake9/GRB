The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:10:03 UT on 24 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210824A (trigger 651471008.06188 / 210824174).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 235.1, Dec = 10.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 40m, 10d 24'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 77.0 degrees.
