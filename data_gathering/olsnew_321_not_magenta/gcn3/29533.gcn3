WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 210217A (Simpson et al.,

GCN 29521) starting at ~4.27 hours after the Swift trigger.

A total of 30x60s images were obtained in the clear (roughly R) filters.

We marginally detect the optical afterglow (Simpson et al., GCN 29521;

Zhu et al., GCN 29523) in the coadd image with a mag of 20.8 +/- 0.3,

calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
