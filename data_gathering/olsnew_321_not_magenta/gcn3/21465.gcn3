The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170728A (Cannizzo et al., GCN 21367) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2017 Jul 28.32, Jul 30.25, Aug 
01.27 and Aug 05.23 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Goad et al., GCN 21368), with 3sigma upper limits of 141 uJy, 
131 uJy, 129 uJy and 133 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
