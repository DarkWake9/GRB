B. Sbarufatti, V. Mangano (INAF/IASF Pa) report on behalf of the  
Swift XRT team

Swift XRT began observations of GRB 080710 (Sbarufatti et al., GCN
Circ. 7957) at 08:02 UT, 49 minutes after the trigger. The refined  
position for
the afterglow, obtained using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT
field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue (see Evans et al., GCN Circ.  
7964)
is RA, Dec = 8.27364, 19.50158 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  00 33 5.67
Dec (J2000): +19 30 05.7

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The XRT observations consist of 7.9 ks in Photon Counting mode. The
light-curve can be fitted by a simple power-law model with slope (1.0  
+/- 0.1),
with superposed flaring activity.

The average spectrum can be modeled by a power-law with photon index  
2.09
+/-0.1 and an intrinsic absorbing column of (1.6 +/-0.7) E21 cm^-2 at
z=0.845 (Perley et al., GCN Circ. 7962) in excess with respect to the  
Galactic
value (4.1E+20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005). The observed  
(unabsorbed) flux in
the 0.3-10 keV band is 5.35 (5.84)E-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1. The count  
rate to flux
conversion factor is 4.1E-11.

The predicted flux for tomorrow, 07:13 UT (24 h after the trigger) is
6.9E-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.
