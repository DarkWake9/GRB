report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:29:52.57 UT on 26 August 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200826A (trigger 620108997 / 200826187).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, was reported in GCN 28284.

The GBM light curve shows an exceptionally bright short GRB
with a duration (T90) of about 1.14 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.29 s to T0+1.76 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 89.8 +/- 3.7 keV,
alpha = -0.41 +/- 0.07, and beta = -2.4 +/- 0.1

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.8 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 39.06 +/- 0.42 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
