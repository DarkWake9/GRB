report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

The Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 160503A which 
triggered the Fermi-GBM at 13:36:32.01 on May, 03, 2016 (trigger 
483975395 / 160503567).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be:

RA, Dec = 0.54, -1.93 (degrees, J2000) with an error radius of 0.52 deg 
(90 % containment, statistical error only).

This was 25 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger. The 
event is faint and soft, but detected over a long time scale (10 ks). No 
events at GeV energies and above have been observed.
A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.
The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Elisabetta Bissaldi 
(elisabetta.bissaldi@ba.infn.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an 
international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many 
scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
