D. Malesani (NBI-DARK), E. Stempels (Univ. St. Andrews), J.P.U. Fynbo, 
J. Hjorth (NBI-DARK), report:

We observed the field of GRB 070103 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 5988) with the 
NOT equipped with the ALFOSC camera. Weather conditions were not optimal 
with passing clouds.

We do not detect any source at the position of the X-ray afterglow, down 
to limiting magnitudes R ~ 21.2 and I ~ 21, calibrated using 
instrumental zeropoints. Mid times of the exposures were Jan 3.886 (R) 
and Jan 3.901 UT (I), that is 37 and 50 minutes after the GRB, respectively.

We encourage observations at longer wavelengths.
