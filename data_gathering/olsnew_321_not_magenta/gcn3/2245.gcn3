S. Zharikov(OAN IA UNAM), V. Chavushyan, R. Mujica (INAOE) report:

We have observed the OT GRB030329 found by B.Peterson and P.Price (GCN 
1985) using the 2.1m telescope of the "Guillermo Haro" Observatory in 
Cananea, Sonora, Mexico with the Landessternwarte Faint Object 
Spectrograph and Camera (LFOSC). 
The I image was obtained on April 26 with  time of exposure 1200s.
Several R band images with time of exposure 1800s were obtained on April
28,30 and May 2,5,6 and 8 under good photometric conditions. Based on
filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN 2082) we estimate of OT magnitudes:
