We observed the field of the Fermi-LAT detected GRB 130310A (Guiriec, et
al., GCN 14282) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera
(RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir.  Data were
taken in the r' and i' channels for a central 9.8 x 7.3 arcmin^2 portion of
the IPN error region (Golenetskii, et al., GCN 14284), centered on RA, DEC
= 141.90061, -17.10809 (J2000),  in 2 epochs, 1.31-1.47 days after the
Fermi trigger and 3.31-3.45 days after the Fermi trigger.  We reach a
limiting magnitude ~24 (AB) in both channels in both epochs.  Data were
captured in the Z, Y, J, and H bands over a larger field (14.8 x 12.5
arcmin^2), reaching a shallower limit (~22 AB).

Of the XRT candidate afterglows (Sbarufatti, et al., GCN 14316), only
source #5 is contained in our images.  We detect that source in both epochs
at a position RA, DEC = 141.881334, -17.147639 (+/-0.5" J2000):

Epoch 1:
  r' = 23.6 +/- 0.1
  i' = 23.6 +/- 0.2

Epoch 2:
  r' = 23.5 +/- 0.1
  i' = 23.3 +/- 0.2

These magnitudes are in the AB system, not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB, and calibrated relative to USNO-B1.
 We find that source #5 has remained approximately constant in flux over a
2 day period.  It has not faded and is therefore unlikely to be the
afterglow of GRB 130310A.  This source is not detected in the Z, Y, J, or H
bands. We also note that we have searched for additional fading sources
(delta_mag > 0.5) in all bands and have found none.

Mártir.
