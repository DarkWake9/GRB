S. B. Cenko reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB080319A (Pagani et al., GCN 7426) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope beginning approximately 2.5 minutes
after the burst.  Inside the XRT error circle (and consistent with the
UVOT candidate) we find a single faint, fading point source at coordinates
(J2000.0):

	RA: 13:45:20.01
        Dec: +44:04:48.6

with an estimated uncertainty of ~ 0.3".  Using the USNO-B catalog as a
reference, we measure a magnitude of R ~ 20.25 +/- 0.2 in our initial
R-band image.

Further observations are planned.
