WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 200131A (Sbarufatti et al.,
GCN 26953) starting at 4.15 hours after the burst. Observations
were performed in the clear (roughly R) filters, a total of 11
images were obtained and the exposure time was 60 s per image.
We do not detect the optical afterglow reported by UVOT (Sbarufatti
et al., GCN 26953; see also Lipunov et al. GCN 26954; Butler
et al. GCN 26957), neither in single image nor in the co-add image.
The limiting magnitude estimated from our coadd image is about 19.5 mag.
