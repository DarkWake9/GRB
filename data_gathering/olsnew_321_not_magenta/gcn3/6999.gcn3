We have observed the field of GRB071025(C. Pagani , GCN 6986)
with TNT 0.8m telescope at Xinglong observatory, started from
10:27:28.296 UT, about 6.3 hours after the burst. The wheter was
not good. A series of I-band images were obtained, and no new 
source was found in our 18*240s combined image within the
error region of the XRT(C. Pagani, GCN6986 GCN6990) and the 
locations reported by E.S. Rykoff(GCN 6987); S. Covino (GCN 6988);
J. S. Bloom (GCN 6989;).
 
the 3 sigma limit of our combined image derived from USNO-B1.0 
Imag was I =18.2 mag at the mean time of 7.1 hours after the burst.
