V.Rumyantsev (CrAO), V.Biryukov (SAI, MSU),  A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB041015 (INTEGRAL trigger 2019) with
2.6m telescope of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. Six  R-band images with
120 sec exposure were taken between (UT) Oct.16 21:25 - 21:38 under moderate
weather conditions. The observed fields was 2.4x1.6  arcminutes centered at
the error box. The upper limit of combined image is R~22.0 mag. as estimated
from several stars  USNO-A2.0 catalog. Comparison with DSS2  red plate does
not reveal any new objects brighter than ~20 mag.

The combined image is available at http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB041015/
