Antoine Kouchner (APC/Univ. de Paris) reports for the ANTARES Collaboration:

In the recent GCN #28142, a reference to Notice https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_hawc/19170_50.amon has been introduced accidentally.
The only reference that should have been introduced is the one to Notice https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_nu_em/54519_0.amon

We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.
