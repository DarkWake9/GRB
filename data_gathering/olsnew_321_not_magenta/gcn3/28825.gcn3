Swift Observatory Team:

At 17:33:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 201104B (trigger=1004168).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 5.217, 7.820 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 20m 52s
   Dec(J2000) = 07d 49' 12"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty). Due to GCN downtime, no BAT light curves are
available at this moment. 

The XRT began observing the field at 17:35:28.2 UT, 102 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec = 5.21528, 7.84257 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 00h 20m 51.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 50' 33.3"
with an uncertainty of 5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 81.5 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

Due to GCN downtime, no UVOT data are available at this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (bxs60 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
