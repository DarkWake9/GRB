N. J. Klingler (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 02:14:37.50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190331A (trigger=895813).  Swift did not slew immediately 
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 28.576, +27.619 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 01h 54m 18s
   Dec(J2000) = +27d 37' 10"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a bright multi-peaked 
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate was ~6000 
counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 18:15 UT on 2019 June 12. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (klp5 AT leicester.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
