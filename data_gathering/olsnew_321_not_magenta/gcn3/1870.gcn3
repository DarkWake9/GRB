A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, HETE-FREGATE, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)  observed this GRB at
09942 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately  50 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
1.2E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  1.2E-06 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 171.644, +41.752 degrees, whose radius is 55.349 +/-  0.035
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
