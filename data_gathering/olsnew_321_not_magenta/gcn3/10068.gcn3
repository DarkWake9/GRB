At 14:18:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered (373691)
and located XTE J1752-223 (detected yesterday by XTE but not yet announced). 
Swift did not slew to this transient because of a Moon observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 268.044, -22.325, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 52m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = -22d 19' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows nothing significant
as is typical for an image trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no immediate XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

This location will come out of constraint early UT tomorrow.
