collaboration report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope began observing Swift GRB 160705B (Cannizzo 
et al., GCN 19657) on July 05, 21:05:14 UT (3.1 minutes after the burst 
trigger). Inside the XRT error circle we find an uncatalogued source 
which is not present in the SDSS at the following position:

RA(J2000)=  11:12:26.27
Dec(J2000)= +46:42:01.2

with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec and r~21 mag (AB) @ 36 minutes post GRB.
