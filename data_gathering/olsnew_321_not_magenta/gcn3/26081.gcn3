report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2019-10-25T18:42:09.10 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 191025A (trigger ID: HEB191025779) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by INTEGRAL/SPIACS (Trigger Number: 8394) and 
Konus-Wind. 

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple 
pulses with a duration (T90) of 0.145 s measured from T0+0.03 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.123 s, is 63021 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 2544 counts. The data of 
Insight-HXMT/HE suffers saturation in the brightest part.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
