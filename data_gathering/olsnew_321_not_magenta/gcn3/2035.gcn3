report:

The OT of GRB030329 (Peterson and Price, GCN 1985) was observed with
MASTER system (280mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru, GCN 2002). We obtained
about 200 measurements in R filter, with calibration to several tens of
USNO A2.0 stars located in 15 arcmin field around the OT. Our
observations started at Mar 29, 17.1 UT (5.5 hours after the GRB) and had
been lasting for 8.5 hours up to Mar 30, 1.5 UT (13.9 hours after the GRB).

Corresponding to our observations, R-band flux declines as t^-1.0 (sligtly
differs from t^-1.1 reported by Burenin et al. GCN 2024). At the end of
observations the OT's brightness began to decrease more rapidly. We had
very poor transparancy at that time, so flux measurements uncertanities
were quite big, therefore we can't confirm or refute -1.9 index reported
by Garnavich et al. (GCN 2018).

Our lightcurve based on 114 measurements available at:

Further analysis of the obtained data is underway.
