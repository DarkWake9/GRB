SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021102 (annulus)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams,
and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 57512 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  10 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  4.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  6.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 359.805, -35.389 degrees, whose radius is 59.486 +/-  0.044
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.

It is not known at this point whether this event was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
