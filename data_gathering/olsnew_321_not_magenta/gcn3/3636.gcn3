C. Hurkett, K. Page (U. Leicester), D. Burrows (PSU), M. Chester (PSU), L.
Angelini (GSFC-JHU) and N. Gehrels (GSFC) report for the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the XRT data for GRB 050717 (GCN 3633, Hurkett et al)
starting at 91s seconds after the trigger. The new refined coordinates are
(J2000);

RA 14:17:25.0
Dec -50:31:58.9

with an uncertainty of 6 arcseconds (90% containment). This position is 14
arcsecond from the position reported in GCN 3634 (Kennea et al).

XRT observations began in Windowed Timing (WT) mode 91 seconds after the
trigger before going into PC mode at 310s. The lightcurve has initial
decay index of 1.95 (+0.18/-0.11), breaking at ~318s into a decay index of
1.29 (+/-0.08).

The spectrum between 91s and 310s seconds after the trigger (WT data) has
an average photon index of 1.61 (+0.11/-0.10), with the absorption fixed
at its Galactic value of 2.3e21 cm^-2 and an indication of an excess
absorption of 2.66e21 (+0.06e21/-0.05e21) cm^-2. The mean unabsorbed flux
in WT mode at 201s (mean time) is 7.74 (+0.21/-0.24) x e-10 erg/cm^2/s in
the 0.5-10.0 keV energy range.
