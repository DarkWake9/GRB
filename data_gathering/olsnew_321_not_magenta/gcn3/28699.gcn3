A. S. Moskvitin,  V. N. Aitov (SAO RAS)
on behalf of GRB follow-up team report.

We observed the field of GRB 201014A, Swift trigger 1000255
(Ambrosi et al., GCN 28623) with the 1-m telescope of SAO RAS,
Zeiss-1000 + Multi-Mode Photometer-Polarimeter.

We obtained 6 x 300 sec. images in Rc band on October 15,
21:11:44--21:43:50, t_mid - T0 = 0.9439 days since trigger.

Inside the enhanced XRT circle (Dâ€™Elia et al., GCN #28626;
Perri et al., GCN #28638) we marginally detected the GRB OT
(Pozanenko et al., GCN #28628; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN #28650;
Dichiara et al., GCN #28654; Zhu et al., GCN #28655)
with the brightness of R = 24.0 +/- 0.3 (calibrated against the nearby
SDSS stars, magnitudes converted with the Lupton 2005 equations).

We also obtained 12 x 300 sec. images in Rc band on October 16,
20:55:16--21:59:23, t_mid - T0 = 1.9435 days since trigger.
We did not detect OT down to the limiting magnitude of R_lim = 24.0.
