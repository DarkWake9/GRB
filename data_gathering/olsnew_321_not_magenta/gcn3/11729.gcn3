SUBJECT: GRB 110212A: Swift XRT and UVOT observations
DATE:    11/02/14 19:59:12 GMT
FROM:    Valerio D'Elia at ASDC  <delia@asdc.asi.it>

V. D'Elia, G. Stratta (ASDC), N.P.M. Kuin (MSSL-UCL), report on behalf  
of the Swift team:

Swift XRT and UVOT instruments began observing the field of the BAT
burst GRB 110212A (D'Elia et al., GCN circ 11699) on 2011-02-13 at 23:21,
that is, 46 h (166.3 ks) after the burst trigger due to a Moon constraint.
The observations ended on 2011-02-14 at 02:47.
No candidate afterglow is detected in the BAT error circle.

UVOT observed in the uvm2 filter, with a total exposure time of 5885 s.
No new source is found in or near the BAT error circle from comparison
to the DSS image. The 5-sigma upper limit for a source is uvm2 > 20.3  
magnitudes.

XRT observations have a total exposure time of 5967 s, and yield a three sigma
upper limit of 1.4e-3 counts/second for any new source in the BAT  
error circle.

This circular is an official product of the Swift Team.
