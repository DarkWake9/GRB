report on behalf of the Swift-XRT and UVOT teams:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 160612A (Lien et al. GCN Circ. 19537),
collecting 985 s of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+178.4 ks
and T0+179.4 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field is 0.008 ct	s^-1,
corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 3.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020665.

The UVOT did not detect an afterglow within the BAT error circle, down
to a magnitude of > 20.87 with an exposure of 978s in the w2 filter.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT and UVOT teams.
