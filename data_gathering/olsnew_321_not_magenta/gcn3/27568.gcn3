K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed a second follow-up observation of the
INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS and Swift-BAT GUANO detected possible short burst GRB
200405B (James DeLaunay et al. GCN Circ. 27497), collecting ~1.2 ks of
Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+550.8 ks and T0+584.0 ks. Of the
four uncatalogued X-ray sources reported in GCN 27500 (Sbarufatti et al.),
none shows any evidence of fading. We therefore conclude that Swift did
not detect the X-ray afterglow of this GRB.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
