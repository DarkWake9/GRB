Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130211A (trigger #548276)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 14195).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 147.524, -42.330 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 50m 05.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -42d 19' 47.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 40%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple, weak, overlapping peaks
starting at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T-2 sec, and ending at ~T+30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 25.1 +- 6.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.56 to T+32.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.81 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.4 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-1.58 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
