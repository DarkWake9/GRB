Dale A. Frail (NRAO) and Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) report on behalf
of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward GRB
080503 (GCN 7665) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz at 2008 May 6.57 UT.
We do not detect the GRB afterglow in 2.5 hours of VLA observations.
The 3-sigma upper limit on the afterglow flux is 54 uJy (rms 18 uJy).

Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
