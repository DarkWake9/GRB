We carried out observations of ZTF22aaajecp/AT2022cmc
(Andreoni et al. GCN 31590) with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) on 2022-02-26 (~15.25 days post-discovery).

The array was in the EW367 array configuration and we excluded CA06
from our processing to obtain more uniform u-v coverage. We used
3C286 for gain, bandpass and flux scale calibration to ensure
consistency with observations from Northern radio facilities.

We detect a compact radio source at the location of the transient
and measure a flux density of ~1.6 mJy at 33.5 GHz.

Further observations are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
