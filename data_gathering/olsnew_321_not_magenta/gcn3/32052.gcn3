V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), D.N. Burrows (PSU),
J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester),
J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Swift/BAT-GUANO-detected burst GRB 220511A (Ursi et al. GCN Circ.
32021). The observations now extend from T0+37.5 ks to T0+285.4 ks. 

Of the sources reported by D'Elia et al. (GCN Circ. 32029), "Source 1"
is fading with 2.4 sigma significance and thus is believed to be the
GRB afterglow.	The position of this source is RA, Dec=287.4316,
+17.7297 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 19:09:43.59
Dec(J2000): +17:43:46.9

with an uncertainty of 5.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 59 arcsec from the Swift/BAT-GUANO position. 

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=0.9 (+0.9, -0.6).
