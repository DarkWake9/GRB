S. Covino (INAF/OAB) on behalf of the REM team:

We observed the field of the GRB141109A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 17037) simultaneously in the optical and near infrared with the the 60-cm robotic telescope REM at La Silla Observatory (Chile). 

The observations started at 05:52:08 UT, about 2 min after the GRB, when the source was less than 10deg from the local horizon. 

A candidate afterglow in the XRT error box is detected at the coordinates:
RA(J2000) = 09:38:07:40
DEC(J2000) = -00:36:30.13

A very preliminary photometry indicates it was H~15.7 about 35 min after the burst.
