A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Mars Odyssey - HEND, Konus - Wind, and INTEGRAL - SPI-ACS observed this
10 s long event at 76450 s.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000) = 333.894, -15.273 degrees, whose
radius is 48.278 +/- 0.491 degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus
ecliptic latitude response limits the arrival direction to ecliptic
latitudes between +25 and +75 degrees, that is, to those portions of
the annulus north of RA, Decl. = 288, +3 degrees and 359, +27 degrees.

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as this event was
not observed by Ulysses, a small error box cannot be obtained for it.
