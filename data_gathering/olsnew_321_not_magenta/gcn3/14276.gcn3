TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14276
SUBJECT: GRB 130305A: Further Swift-XRT Observations

FROM:    Binbin Zhang at PSU  <bbzhang@psu.edu>

Bin-Bin Zhang (PSU), Daniele Malesani (DARK/NBI), Dirk Grupe (PSU),
David N. Burrows (PSU) and Kim L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed 16 ks of XRT data for the Swift/BAT-detected burst:
GRB 130305A,  from 31.0 ks to 210.2 ks after the  Swift/BAT trigger.
The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. We confirm that 
the X-ray source reported in Malesani et al. GCN 1426  is fading.  
The light curve can be modeled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=2.4 (+0.5, -0.4).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020234.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
