Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 081221 (GCN 8687) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 Dec 27.14
UT. The GRB radio afterglow is undetected at 3-sigma level. However,
there is a 2.5 sigma source (97 +/- 38 uJy) at the Gemini optical
afterglow position reported by Tanvir et al. (GCN 8698).

Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
