A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), M. J. Moss (George Washington University),
B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 22:44:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190324A (trigger=894718).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 49.576, -47.239 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 18m 18s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 14' 21"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a precursor 
at ~T0 and a bright multi-peaked structure starting at ~T+19 s. 
The total duration is about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~8000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~21 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+52.4
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. J. LaPorte (extragsam AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
