TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  19242
SUBJECT: GRB 160327A: KAIT optical afterglow confirmation
DATE:    16/03/28 19:36:40 GMT
FROM:    Weikang Zheng at UC Berkeley  <weikang@berkeley.edu>

WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report
on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 151027A (Racusin et al.,
GCN 19235) starting at 09:17:37 UT, 90 s after the burst under
fair condition. Observations were performed with an automatic 
sequence in the clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the 
exposure time was 20 s per image.  

The afterglow reported by Golkhou et al. (GCN 19236) was not detected
in any of our single images, however, it is detected in the
co-added images in both clear and I band, except V band. We report
the follow detection magnitude or upper limit:

Filter   co-add      Mid-time  Detection_Mag    Upper_limit
       
clear    20s x 10     549s      19.8 +/- 0.3    -
clear    20s x 10    1495s      20.2 +/- 0.4    -
clear    20s x 10    2162s            -         20.0
I        20s x 10     615s      18.1 +/- 0.2    -
I        20s x 10    1541s      18.8 +/- 0.4    -
I        20s x 10    2195s            -         18.7
V        20s x 15     781s            -         18.9
