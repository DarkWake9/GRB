Dirk Grupe (Swift MOC, PSU)  reports on behalf of the 
Swift team:

We report on the Swift XRT observations of the field of the
Fermi GBM detected GRB 140105A (Xiong & Connaughton GCN Circ. 
15688). We followed three of the four afterglow candidates 
reported by Singer et al. (GCN circular 15686). We did not find 
an X-ray source in any of these observations. Below is a summary 
of the XRT observations:

iPTF14ai: target ID 20338, T-exp=3939s, 
          Tstart = 2014-01-05 19:46
          3sigma ul = 1.5e-3 counts/s
	  
iPTF14ae:  target ID 20339, T-exp=3962s
          T-start = 2014-01-05 23:01
          3sigma ul = 1.53-3 counts/s
          Note that the bright source in the XRT image
	  is the Seyfert 1 galaxy SBS 1343+537.
	  
iPFT14x:  target ID 20340, T-exp=3077s
          T-start = 2014-01-06 08:56
          3sigma ul = 2.8e-3 counts/s
	  
	  
Note that Swift was not able to observe the field of the forth
source, iPTF14ac, because the star tracker did not lock onto the
target and caused Swift to go into a safehold. 

This report is an official product of the Swift team.
