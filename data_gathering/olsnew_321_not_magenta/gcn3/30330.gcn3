The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:29:15 UT on 27 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210627A (trigger 646471760.677184 / 210627312).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 148.3, Dec = 44.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 53m, 44d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 109.0 degrees.
