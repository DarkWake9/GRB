"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060202 (GCN 4629) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 09:28:22 UT, 47.45 min
after the Swift trigger time.
  After co-adding a set of 14 images (09:40:34 - 09:57:32 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
  Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 16.9 mag."
