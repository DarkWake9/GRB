We observed the field of GRB 141121A (Lien et al., GCN 17075) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m
Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2014/11 29.29 to 2014/11 29.53 UTC (195.13 to 200.87 hours
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.62 hours exposure in the r, i and
z bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the SDSS DR9,
we obtain the following detections and upper limits (3-sigma):

  r = 22.15 +/- 0.06
  i = 21.97 +/- 0.06
  z > 21.04

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The afterglow continues to fade with a steepening temporal index.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro Mártir.
