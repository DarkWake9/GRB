Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the GIT team:

We observed GRB 210610A detected by Swift-BAT ( K. L. Page et al., GCN
#30160, optical counterpart reported by R. Hosokawa et al., GCN #30161 and
D. Xu et al., GCN #30162), with the 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We
obtained a 300-sec exposure in the r' filter. We clearly detected the
afterglow in our image at R.A.= 13:37:07.64 and DEC.= 14:27:55.10. The
photometric results follow as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (start) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Filter | Magnitude (AB) |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

2459376.178 | 1.22 | r' |  18.79+/- 0.05 |

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS DR1 (Flewelling et al., 2018)
and not corrected for Galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
