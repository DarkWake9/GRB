Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to re-observe the field of view toward
GRB 081221 (GCN 8687) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 Dec 28.16
UT for a longer integration. The GRB radio afterglow is clearly
detected at the Gemini optical afterglow position (GCN 8698) with the
flux density of 167 +/- 27 uJy.
