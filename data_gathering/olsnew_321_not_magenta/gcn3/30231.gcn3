Markku Nissinen (Taurus Hill Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) and Arto Oksanen 
(Hankasalmi Observatory, Hankasalmi, Finland) report:

We have detected GRB 210610B optical afterglow (Page et al., GCN30170) using 
iTelescope T18 (0.32-m f/8.0 + CCD in AstroCamp at Nerpio, Spain), iTelescope T21 
(0.43-m f/6.8 + f/4.5 focal reducer + CCD in New Mexico Skies at Mayhill, 
New Mexico, USA) and iTelescope T11 (0.50-m f/6.8 + f/4.5 focal reducer + CCD 
in New Mexico Skies at Mayhill, New Mexico, USA). 

We took total of 24 exposures with clear (CR), V and R filters. 

The afterglow was clearly detected with each filter at the position
RA 16:15:40.43 DEC +14:23:57.4.  

The following magnitudes were measured from comparison of a nearby star
(V = 13.97, r'=13.70) from the APASS DR9 catalogue (Henden+, 2016):

We used r' reference magnitude for the clear filter and the R filter measurements.
