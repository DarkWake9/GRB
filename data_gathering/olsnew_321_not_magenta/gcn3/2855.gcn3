NUMBER:  2855
SUBJECT: GRB041217: P60 Optical Observations
DATE:    04/12/18 14:04:30 GMT

S. Bradley Cenko reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

"We have imaged the entire 12-arcmin radius error circle of the Swift GRB
041217 with the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted
of 25 x 120-second exposures in the Gunn g and Kron I filters.  High winds
led to extremely poor seeing conditions (~ 3-arcsec average).  To a
limiting magnitude of I~19.5 we detect no new objects by reference to the
Digitized Sky Survey (second epoch).

Continued analysis and further observations are planned."
