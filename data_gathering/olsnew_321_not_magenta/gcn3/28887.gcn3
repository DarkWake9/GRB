The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 20/11/14 at 15:05:31.96 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_GOLD alert stream.  The threshold astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50% . This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 0.92 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134698_40735501.amon), more  
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 20/11/14
Time:  15:05:31.96 UT
RA: 105.25 (+ 1.28 - 1.12  deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 6.05 (+ 0.95 - 0.95 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There is one Fermi 4FGL/3FHL source located within the 90% localization region, 4FGL J0658.6+0636, located at RA: 104.64 deg, Dec: 6.60 deg (J2000), at a distance of 0.81 deg from the best-fit event position. 

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
