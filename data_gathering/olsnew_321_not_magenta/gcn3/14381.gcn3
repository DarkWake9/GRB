(INAF/TNG) report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale et al., GCN 14377) with
the TNG telescope located in the Canary Islands. We obtained a set of
images with the DOLORES camera in the B, V, R and I bands, starting on
2013 Apr 18 at 23:01:02 UT (4.0 hours after the GRB).

The optical afterglow (De Pasquale et al. GCN 14377; Gorosabel et al. GCN
14378; Quadri et al. 14379) is clearly detected in all bands. The measured
R-band magnitude is 18.1 (at t-t0=4.06 h; calibrated against the USNOB1
catalogue).


We acknowledge support from the TNG visiting astronomer F. Borsa.
