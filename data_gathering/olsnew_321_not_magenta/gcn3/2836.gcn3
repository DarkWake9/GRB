TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2836
SUBJECT: Distribution of IBAS Alerts for NON-GRB sources
DATE:    04/11/30 13:04:49 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

A new version of the IBAS alert distribution system is operational at the
INTEGRAL Science Data Center. The new version can distribute in real time
Alert Packets for different classes of sources which trigger the GRB
detection programs.

IBAS users interested in alerts from non-GRB sources should register at
the ISDC Web pages in order to select the classes of sources of interest
(X-ray bursters, Soft Gamma Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars).

They can also download a new version of the IBAS Client Software (although
not strictly needed, this will allow them to fully exploit the new
information in the Alert Packets for non-GRB sources).

The IBAS users interested in Alerts only for Gamma-Ray Bursts will
continue to receive them, without the need of installing the new version
of the IBAS Client Software.
