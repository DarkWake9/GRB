TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

Swift-XRT started observing the field of view of the SuperAGILE burst GRB 
071104 (Donnarumma et al., GCN Circ. 7042), ~20.6 ks after the AGILE 
trigger. In the first 10 ks of data, we detect a clear, fading X-ray 
source at a position of RA, Dec (J2000) = 295.6117, +14.6104, which is 
equivalent to

RA(J2000)  = 19 42 26.81 
Dec(J2000) = 14 36 37.4

with an uncertainty radius of 4.2 arcsec (90% containment, including 
boresight uncertainties). This is 131 arcsec from the AGILE position, 
within their error circle.

Further analysis of these XRT data will be reported in a subsequent 
circular.
