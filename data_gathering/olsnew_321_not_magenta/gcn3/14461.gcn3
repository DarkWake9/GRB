C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), J. Japeli, A. Gomboc
(U. Ljubljana), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) on behalf of a
large collaboration report:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North automatically began observing
GRB 130427B (Maselli et al. GCN Circ. 14460) at 4.6 minutes from
the Swift/BAT trigger time.
The automatic LT-TRAP procedure identified a bright uncatalogued
object at the following position consistent with that reported
by Maselli et al.:

RA=   20:59:35.62
Dec= -22:32:46.9

(J2000.0).
Its magnitude is estimated to be 15.5 in the R band.
