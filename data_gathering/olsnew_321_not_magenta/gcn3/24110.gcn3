the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190412m at T0 = 2019-04-12 05:30:44.17 (UT)
(GCN #24098), a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 showed that
the S190412m 90% c.l. localization region (LR) was occulted by the Earth (GCN #24100).

We performed an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data
in the energy range 30 MeV - 10 GeV, over two separate time intervals with good exposure
of the S190412m 90% LR, before and after T0.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) are obtained:

(T0 - 700s; T0 - 600s): from 4.2e-08 to 2.1e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1. LR coverage: <20%.

(T0 + 1600s; T0 + 1800s): from 4.1e-08 to 2.3e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1. LR coverage: ~70%.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the sky
in spinning mode.
