We observed the field of the short GRB 170112A (Mingo, et al., GCN 20436)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org)
on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico 
Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/01 12.15 to 2017/01 12.21 UTC (1.58 to
2.95 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.76 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 0.32 hours exposure in the Z and Y bands.

Comparison to the DSS reveals no obvious new source brighter than about
magnitude 19. However our data are deeper and we cannot yet exclude a 
fainter
counterpart.

Further observations to check for variability are planned.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
