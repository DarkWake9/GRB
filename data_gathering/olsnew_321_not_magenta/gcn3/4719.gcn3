TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4719
SUBJECT: GRB 060209 : TAROT optical observation
DATE:    06/02/09 20:26:25 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060209 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 180931) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 23.7s after the GCN trigger
(10s after the notice). The field elevation decreased from
74 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good (moon at 41.0deg, phase=0.79).
All images are not filtered.

Date of trigger : t0 = 2006 feb. 09 19:08:55.95 UTC

First image is 30s exposure trailed. No OT is visible:
t0+23.7s to t0+83.7s : R > 15.8

Second image is 30s exposure. No OT is visible:
t0+90.2s to t0+120.2s : R > 17.2

We co-added a series of exposures. No OT is visible:
t0+90.2s to t0+967.1s : R > 18.3

Galactic coordinates are lon=147.439131 lat=6.264359
and the galactic extinction in R band is 2.3 magnitudes
from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1
