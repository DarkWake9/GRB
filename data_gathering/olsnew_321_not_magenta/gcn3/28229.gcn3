S.Y. Fu, Z.P. Zhu, X. Liu, D. Xu (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 Senior High 
School), X. Zhang, J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200806A (Ambrosiet al., GCN 28211) using 
the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 
8x100s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 19:42:36 UT on 
2020-08-07, i.e., 28.22 hr after the burst.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the enhanced XRT 
position (Beardmore et al., GCN 28214), down to a limiting magnitude of 
r~20.2, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
