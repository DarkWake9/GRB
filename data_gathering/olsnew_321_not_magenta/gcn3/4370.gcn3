J. S. Bloom reports:

Correction. GCN 4368 incorrectly stated that our discovery of the  
long-wavelength counterpart to 051221 was the first IR counterpart  
for a short-hard GRB: the Magellan/PANIC detection of 050724 (Berger  
et al. Nature, 438, 988-990, 2005) was the first. I apologize for  
this referencing oversight and thank E. Berger for pointing out this  
error.
