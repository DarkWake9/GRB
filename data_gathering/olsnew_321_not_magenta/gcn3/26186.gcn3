In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S191105e at T0 = 2019-11-05
14:35:21.933 UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows
that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less than 10%
of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR) (30% of 90% c.l. LR is occulted by
Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10
GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S191105e 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are
obtained:

from 1.44e-06 to 9.71e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 11% of the
LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 5s );
from 6.45e-07 to 9.88e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 16% of the
LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 10s );
from 3.65e-08 to 2.73e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 52% of the
LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in
progress.
