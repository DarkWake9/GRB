"We observed the field of view of GRB 070125 (GCN 6024) with Combined
Association for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) telescope
in 3mm band (95 GHz) at the mean observation time of 2007 Feb 5, 0700 UT.
We detect the GRB at the P-60 optical afterglow position (GCN# 6028).
The flux density of the GRB is 2.2+/-0.7 mJy.

We acknowledge excellent support from the observing staff of CARMA."
