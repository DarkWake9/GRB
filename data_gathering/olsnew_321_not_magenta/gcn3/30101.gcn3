The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 23:53:37 UT on 29 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210529B (trigger 644025222.097546 / 210529996).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 230.0, Dec = 36.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 20m, 36d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 16.0 degrees.
