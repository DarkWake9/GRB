D. Bersier (Liverpool JMU) and A. Gomboc (U. Ljubljana)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 080710 (Sbarufatti et al. GCN 7957) with the 2m
robotic Faulkes Telescope North. We obtained multi-colour images
(BVRi) starting 4.2 hours after the burst. We confirm the presence of
a fading source at the position of the afterglow (Li et al. GCN 7959;
D'Avanzo et al GCN 7960). At a time of 4.4 hours after burst we
measure an R-band magnitude of 17.8 (calibrated with respect to USNO
R2). The decay rate is approximately -0.82.

We note that the afterglow is well detected in the B band, indicating
a rather low redshift (in agreement with Perley et al. GCN 7962).

Observations are continuing.
