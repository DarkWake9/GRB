E. Berger (Harvard U.) and A. Levan (U. Warwick) report:

On September 29.58 UT we observed the field of GRB 090929B
(Pagani et al. GCN 9963) with Gemini-North + NIRI.
We took a sequence of YJHK bands images under twilight conditions.

No clear afterglow candidate has been found in the XRT refined error
circle (GCN 9964 and 9965) to the following limits (3-sigma):

J > 21.10 mag
H > 19.53 mag
K > 18.06 mag

Our limits are estimated using detected 2MASS objects at comparable
distance to the bright star (R = 9.5) which is located near the XRT
error circle.
We note the presence of a USNO catalogued star inside the refined
error circle; the above limits are exclusive of that star.

We thank the Gemini staff for performing these observations, in
particular Ricardo Schiavon.
