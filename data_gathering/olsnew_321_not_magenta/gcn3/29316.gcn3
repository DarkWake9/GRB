Michael Coughlin (UMN) and Tomas Ahumada (UMD):

We imaged the position of the fast fading ZTF source ZTF21aaeyldq (Ho et
al., GCN 29305), with the the Kitt Peak Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD)
demonstrator (KPED) mounted at the 2.1m Kitt Peak Telescope, starting at
2021-01-17 06:59:49 UT.
We acquired thirty 10 sec exposures in the g- and r-bands, stacked them,
and reduced them following standard procedures. After calibrating the flux
against PS1 sources in the field, we do not see the source reported by Ho
et al. down to a limit of g > 20.1 mag and r > 19.9.
