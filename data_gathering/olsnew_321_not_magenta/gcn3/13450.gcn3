Using the data set from T-141 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120711B (trigger #526270)
(Page, et al., GCN Circ. 13431).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 331.710, 59.996 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 06m 50.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +59d 59' 46.0" 
with an uncertainty of 3.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows the emission starting ~T-100 sec, 
peaking at ~T+20 sec, and slowly decaying out to T+875 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 60 +- 19 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.1 to T+51.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.75 +- 0.32.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.6 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+13.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 

Contrary to our GCN 13431, we now think that this trigger is very likely GRB,
and not a new Galactic source.
