and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170830B (Fermi-GBM trigger #525772316;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 07:51:50.164 UT; INTEGRAL-SPI/ACS trigger
#7903,0) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 07:51:52.372
on 30 August 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM instruments.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at
T0 sec, peaks at T+2 sec and ends at T+3.5 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 3.3 +- 0.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
