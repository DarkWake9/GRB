N. Masetti, E. Palazzi (IASF/CNR, Bologna), E. Pian (INAF - Astron. Obs.
of Trieste), E. Giro, S. Ortolani (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Padua),
S. Covino (INAF - Astron. Obs. of Brera), L.A. Antonelli (INAF - Astron.
Obs. of Rome), on behalf of a larger Italian collaboration, report:

"We have imaged the entire HETE/SXC error box of GRB030115 (=H2533) 
in the R band with the 1.82-m "Copernico" telescope (plus AFOSC) of the
Astronomical Observatory of Asiago (Italy). Our 15-minutes observation
started on 2003 January 15 at 05:25 UT (i.e. 2 hours after the GRB).
The seeing was ~2.5 arcsec.

The magnitude limit of the image is comparable with that of the DSS.
Comparison with the DSS does not reveal any new or remarkable object,
in agreement with the results of GCNs #1806, #1807, #1808 and #1810.
