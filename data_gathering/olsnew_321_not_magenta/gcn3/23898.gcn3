 report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:31:22.48 UT on 15 February 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190215A (trigger 571948287 / 190215772).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is

RA, Dec = 340.4, +37.5 (J2000 degrees)

with an uncertainty of 1.0 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32]).

The initial angle from the Fermi LAT boresight to
the best location is 25 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a bright FRED-like peak with multiple
pulses within it,
with a duration (T90) of about 23 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+23 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.18 +/- 0.03 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 204 +/- 4 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.0 +/- 0.3)E-05  erg/cm^2. The 1s peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.7 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
