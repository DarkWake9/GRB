D.D. Kelson and K. Koviak (Carnegie), with E. Berger and D.B. Fox
(Caltech), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the DSS-resolved galaxy associated with
CXOU J204816.1-401108, Source #2 from the catalog of Fox (GCN 2626),
which is potentially associated with XRF040701 (Barraud et al., GCN
2620), with the Magellan Baade 6.5-m telescope + IMACS spectrograph.
We find the spectrum of this galaxy to be rich in emission lines
including Hbeta4861A, [OIII]4959A,5007A, Halpha6563A, [NII]6548A,6583A,
and [SII]6717,6731. The redshift is z=0.2146."
