Dae-Sik Moon, S. Bradley Cenko (Caltech) and Joe Adams (Cornell) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We have continued to image the NIR afterglow of GRB041219 (Blake and
Bloom, GCN 2870) with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar
200-inch Hale Telescope.  Our latest observations in the K_s
band, taken at a mean time of 01:58:00 UT (1.01 days after the burst), put
the object at a magnitude of 16.5 (with reference to the 2MASS catalog).
This is a significantly shallower decay than we reported for the early
afterglow (GCN 2876).

Further observations are planned."
