TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  390
SUBJECT: GRB990705: No Evidence for Neutrino Signal
DATE:    99/07/19 15:48:49 GMT
FROM:    Walter Fulgione at CNR-Torino  <fulgione@togcxl.to.infn.it>

Walter Fulgione, on behalf of the Large Volume Detector collaboration, report:

Concerning the GRB990705 (BeppoSAX mail # 99/16 and 99/17):

the LVD neutrino telescope in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory
was running on July 5th, 16:01:25 UT and it has been steadily taking
data since June 22nd, with an active scintillator mass of 573 ton.

No evidence for any burst of neutrino interactions has been detected
inside a 48 hours time interval around the GRB time.

The data analysis on a wider time interval to find a possible weak
signal or to establish the limit on the neutrino emission is in progress.

Results will be published, as soon as possible, on LNGS Internal Report
(http://scienza98.lngs.infn.it/)
