SUBJECT: BATSE GRB trigger criteria changed

C. Meegan (NASA/MSFC) reports for the BATSE team:

The BATSE on-board burst trigger algorithm was revised at 14:18 UT on
February 4 to include only counts in channel 4 (>300 keV).  The intent is to
optimize for Terrestrial Gamma Flashes (TGFs).  Hard GRBs will continue to
generate triggers, but at a lower rate.  We expect to remain in this trigger
mode for at least a week.
