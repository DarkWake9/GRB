GRB 190114C with T90=116 s (50-300 keV), Epeak = 998.6 +/- 11.9 keV,
isotropic energy release in gamma-rays Eiso = 3 E53
erg, and the isotropic peak luminosity Liso = 1 E53 erg/s (R. Hamburg et
al., CGN 23707) presents the typical characteristics of type I
binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) (Y. Wang et al., submitted to Astrophysical
Journal arXiv:1811.05433v2). The most significant ever Fermi-LAT GeV
emission (D. Kocevski et al., GCN 23709) with test statistic value TS>2500
implies that this GRB is seen from the normal to the orbital plane of the
progenitor binary system composed of a carbon-oxygen core and a neutron
star companion (R. Ruffini et al., submitted to Astrophysical Journal
arXiv:1803.05476). The TeV emission (R. Mirzoyan et al., GCN 23701), a
first in GRBs, has been recently predicted, as originating from the Wald
solution, within the new inner engine approach of the long GRBs recently
introduced in Ruffini et al (submitted to Physical Review Letter:
arXiv:1811.01839) and Ruffini et al (submitted to Astrophysical Journal:
arXiv:1812.00354). Most interesting this system being at z=0.4245 (A. J.
Castro-Tirado et al., GCN 23708), can give a strong support to our BdHN
approach by observing a supernova. Using the averaged appearance time of
the SNe associated to GRBs (Cano et al., 2016), and considering the
redshift z=0.42 (J. Selsing  et al., GCN 23695, A. J. Castro-Tirado et al.,
GCN 23708), a bright optical signal will peak at 18.8 +/- 3.7 days after
the trigger (February 2nd 2019, uncertainty from  January 30th 2019 to
February 6th 2019) at the location of RA 54.510 and DEC -26.939, with an
uncertainty 3 arcmin (J.D. Gropp et al., GCN 23688). The follow-up
observations, especially the optical bands for the SN, are recommended.
