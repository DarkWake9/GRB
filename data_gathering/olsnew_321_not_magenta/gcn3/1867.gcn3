TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1867
SUBJECT: GRB030115, WSRT radio observations - correction to GCN 1864
DATE:    03/02/17 16:19:39 GMT
FROM:    Evert Rol at U.Amsterdam  <evert@science.uva.nl>

Two of the three quoted WSRT fluxes in GCN 1864 were from a
preliminary reduction of the data. Below are the correct fluxes in a
corrected version of the GCN.

Our apologies.

====================================================================

E. Rol and R. Wijers (University of Amsterdam) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 030115 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at three epochs. The results
are as follows:

  obs. date (UT 2003)        flux (mJy)
------------------------------------------
 Jan 16.8804 - 17.3866    0.024 +/- 0.021
 Jan 20.8696 - 21.3684    0.089 +/- 0.024
 Jan 26.8520 - 27.3520    0.072 +/- 0.026


A combined noise-weighted image results in a 4 sigma detection of 0.058 
+/- 0.014 mJy at the position of the afterglow.

Further observations are planned."
