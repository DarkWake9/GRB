TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3702
SUBJECT: GRB 050709: PROMPT Rc Observations

J. Haislip, J. Kirschbrown, D. Reichart report on behalf of the UNC team of
the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT automatically observed the localization
of the probable short-hard GRB 050709 (Butler et al., GCN 3570; Boer et
al., GCN 3653) beginning 1.1 days after the burst (Bayliss et al., GCN
3569) and again beginning 8.3 days after the burst.

3-sigma limiting magnitudes are based on 5 USNO-B1.0 stars:

Mean Time 	Integration 	Filter 	Limiting 	Telescope
Since GRB 	Time 			Magnitude

1d 5h 36m 	82 x 80s 	Rc 	21.6 		PROMPT-5
8d 9h 3m 	136 x 80s 	Rc 	21.6 		PROMPT-5

We detect the host galaxy (Fox et al., GCN 3585; Price et al., GCN 3612)
in both epochs and measure its brightness to be Rc = 21.16 +/- 0.26 and Rc
= 21.06 +/- 0.21, respectively.  PSF-matched image subtraction using ISIS2
(Alard 2000) does not reveal the afterglow (Price et al., GCN 3612).

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
