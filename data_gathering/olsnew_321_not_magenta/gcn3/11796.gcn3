report:

The field of GRB 110315A (Melandri et al., GCN 11790) was observed
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK
National Observatory, Turkey) in March 16, 2011, during UT 01:05 -
03:15, i.e. starting approximately 1 hour after the burst. A serie of
21 exposures by 300 sec each in Rc filter was obtained.

We found no optical source within the 1.4'' enhanced XRT error circle
(Beardmore et al., GCN 11792) in our combined image at a limiting
magnitude of Rc =~ 23.6 mag.
