The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory observed the field of the IceCube
track-like muon neutrino candidate (RA, Dec = 45.21d, 31.74d; GCN
#27043) consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave
candidate S200213t (GCN #27042) covering ~0.5 sq degrees in 7 tiles to
cover the most probable regions of the joint GW and neutrino
localization (90%-containment radius: 0.4d).  The observations started
at 09:54 UT on February 13th and ended at 10:26 UT on February 13th,
2020, and the typical sensitivity was 2e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10
keV).

In total we found 3 "good" X-ray sources, all of which were classified
as "rank 3", i.e. uncatalogued in X-rays, but with fluxes below
historical upper limits. 2 further rank 3 sources were found with
detection flag of "poor", indicating that they are likely spurious.
Details of the good sources are:

| Source ID    | RA             | Dec            | Err90  | Flux*   |
|  S200213t_X2 | 03h 01m 23.65s | +31d 42' 02.3" |   5.8" | 7.9e-13 |
|  S200213t_X4 | 02h 59m 58.48s | +31d 28' 17.1" |   7.1" | 2.2e-13 |
|  S200213t_X6 | 03h 00m 16.09s | +31d 58' 48.9" |   4.7" | 2.3e-13 |

(* 0.3-10 keV, erg cm^-2 s^-1, assuming a power-law spectrum with
photon index of 1.7 and NH=3e20cm^-2).
