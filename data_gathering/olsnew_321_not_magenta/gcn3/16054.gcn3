GRB 140129A: Mondy optical observations

A. Volnova (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), M. Eselevich (ISTP), I. Korobtsev
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up
collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 140129A (Melandri et al., GCN
15760)with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting on
on Jan. 29 (UT) 12:21:46. We took several images in R-filter of 60 s
exposure. Within enhanced XRT error circle (Evans, GCN 15764) we
detected the optical afterglow (Melandri et al., GCN 15760).


The details of the photometry are the following:

UT start t-T0 Filter Exp. OT
(mid, days) (s)
12:21:46 0.38805 R 42x60 21.39 +/- 0.25

The photometry is based 3 SDSS stars, R (gri -> R transformations by
Lupton 2005):

SDSS id R
J023133.01-013533.5 18.121
J023122.45-013411.0 18.797
