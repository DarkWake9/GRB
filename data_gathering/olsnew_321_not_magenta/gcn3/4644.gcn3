SUBJECT: Swift BAT Trigger 180151: Swift XRT source detection
DATE:    06/02/04 03:24:20 GMT
FROM:    David Burrows at PSU/Swift  <dxb15@psu.edu>

The Swift satellite slewed at 00:45:26 UT on 4 Feb 2006 to the position of 
the BAT trigger 180151 (Retter et al. 2006, GCN 4641), 2990 s after the 
trigger.  Although it is still not clear whether this trigger is from a 
real astrophysical source, we find a faint, possibly fading, and 
uncataloged X-ray source at the following position:

RA(J2000) = 6h 54m 3.9s
Dec(J2000) = +71d 48' 39"

The estimated uncertainty is 6 arcseconds.  The exposure time was 2.5 
ks.  This source is 44 arcseconds from the reported BAT position for 
trigger 180151.

This position includes the new XRT boresight, but was processed using 
proprietary software in an effort to distribute the position as soon as 
possible.  A more definitive statement of the nature of this source will be 
distributed following analysis of the XRT data processed through the normal 
XRT pipeline software at the SDC.
