The long-duration GRB 180126A (Fermi-GBM trigger #538625796; INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS trigger #8000; Konus-Wind trigger time on 02:16:30.33)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:16:29.19 UTC
on 26 January 2018.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The light curve shows a single pulse which starts at T+2 sec, peaks at
T+7 sec and ends at T+10 sec.  The T90 and the T50 durations measured
by the SGM data are 6.3 s +- 1.2 sec and 2.6 s +- 0.5 sec (40-1000
keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
