Using the data set from T-239 to ~T+240 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT
GRB 140607A (trigger #601051) (Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 16364).
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 86.373, 18.904 deg
which is
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 45m 29.5s
   Dec(J2000) = +18d 54' 15.5"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 16%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a very weak multi-peaked
structure starting at ~T-10.0 sec, and ending around T+200 sec.
The burst location went out of the BAT FOV when Swift started slewing
around ~T+200 sec. Thus we have no data beyond ~T+240 sec and
we cannot say when the burst was ended. Based on the available data,
the T90 (15-350 keV) is 109.9 +- 18.5 sec (estimated error
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-17.7 to T+103.8 sec is best fit
by a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the
time-averaged spectrum is 1.78 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the
15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+31.58 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
