The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:59:24 UT on 27 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210827A (trigger 651751169.343218 / 210827416).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 138.3, Dec = 60.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 13m, 60d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 20.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
