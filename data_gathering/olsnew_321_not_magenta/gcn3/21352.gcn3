A. Horesh (HUJI), S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC), A. Levan (U. Warwick), and N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report:

We observed the ultra-long gamma-ray burst (T90 > 1000s; Dâ€™Ai et al. GCN 21340; Evans et al. GCN 21341; Kann et al. GCN 21345; Palmer et al. GCN 21347) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). 
Our observation was undertaken on 2017 July 16 in the C configuration.

We do not detect radio emission at the enhanced XRT position of the source, with a 3 sigma detection limit of 75 micro-Jy at a central frequency of 7.5 GHz. 

Future VLA observations are planned under our program to search for late-time emission. 

We thank the VLA staff for scheduling this target of opportunity.
