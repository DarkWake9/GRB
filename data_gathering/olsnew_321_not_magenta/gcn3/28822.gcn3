report:

We observed the position of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCN 28632) with 
the Chandra X-ray Observatory with epochs 8.4 and 13.6 days after 
trigger. The X-ray afterglow is clearly detected with a flux around 100x 
brighter than expected based on the extrapolation of the early XRT data 
taken between 0.03 and 0.8 days after burst. The source is seen to fade 
between the two Chandra epochs with a power-law index of approximately 
-0.8. A Swift ToO has been approved.
