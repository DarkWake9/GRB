J. A. Kennea reports on behalf of the Swift Mission Operations Center:

At 14:40UT on April 27, 2014, Swift's automated slewing was re-enabled. 
This means that if BAT triggers on a new GRB, Swift will slew (if 
possible) to collect data with the XRT and UVOT instruments, returning 
Swift to full science functionality. Currently, the Swift Mission 
Operation Center move is still in progress and we are not accepting any 
new TOO requests, although we expect to end the TOO moratorium tomorrow.
