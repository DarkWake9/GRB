A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the field centered on the XRT position of the Swift burst
GRB 050416a (GCN#3268) using the VLA at a frequency of 4.86 GHz
on Apr 22.04 UT (t ~ 5.6 days after the burst).
We detect a radio source coincident with the optical afterglow
position reported by Cenko & Fox (GCN#3265).  The flux density of
the source is 260 +- 55 uJy.

Further observations are planned"
