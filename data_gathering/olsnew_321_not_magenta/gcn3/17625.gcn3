(XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 150323C (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 17621)
using the 1m telescope at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations were
carried out in R-band, starting at 17:19:50 UT on 2015-03-23, i.e.,
869 s after the burst.

A source, not present in SDSS and DSS, is well detected in individual
images at coordinates

RA(J2000)  = 12:50:27.92
Dec(J2000) = +50:11:28.75

with an uncertainty of ~ 1 arcsec, being consistent with the enhanced
Swift-XRT position (Evans, GCN 17624). We thus think it's the optical
afterglow of the burst, and it has m(R) = 21.3 +/- 0.2 at a median
time of 1344s post-burst, calibrated with the SDSS field.
