C. Blake and J. S. Bloom report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Following further analysis of ~2000 seconds of J,H,Ks observations of
the field of GRB 050421 (GCN 3296, GCN 3301) with the PAIRITEL 1.3m on
Mt. Hopkins we cannot confirm variability in the source reported in GCN
3306. Furthermore, analysis of our full J,H,Ks data set from UT April 21
does not reveal any sources detected at >3 sigma within the XRT
error-circle."
