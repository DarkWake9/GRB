D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), H. Jonsson (Lund Univ.), and 
P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160607A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 19502) with 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), located in La Palma (Canary 
Islands). Observations were carried out at large airmass (~3) in the 
SDSS i filter, for a total of 20 min on source, at a mean epoch 2016 
June 8.19 UT (0.725 days after the BAT trigger).

Within the refined XRT position (Goad et al., GCN 19503), we detect a 
single, faint source at coordinates (J2000):

RA = 00:54:40.14
Dec = -04:56:53.3

Carrying out photometry against the SDSS catalog, we derive a magnitude 
i = 23.45 +- 0.20 AB. As this value is fainter than the SDSS limit, and 
as we lack variability information, we cannot presently conclude whether 
this source is the afterglow of GRB 160607A. Further observations are 
planned, but will be probably delayed until the field has a better 
visibility from La Palma.
