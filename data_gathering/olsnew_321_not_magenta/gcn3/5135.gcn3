M. M. Chester (PSU), F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC) and J. R. Cummings 
(NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift UVOT Team:


Swift/UVOT took a finding chart exposure of nominal 100 seconds with the 
White (160-650 nm) filter starting 3385 seconds after the BAT trigger 
for GRB 060515 (Cummings, et al., GCN 5132). No reliable afterglow 
candidate has been found in the initial data products. The 8'x8' region 
for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error 
circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag.


No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to 
E(B-V) of  0.03.
