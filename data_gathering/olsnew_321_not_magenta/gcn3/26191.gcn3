Z.P. Zhu, D. Xu (NAOC), J. Viuho (NOT) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 191106A (Marshall et al., GCN 26177) using 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. 
Observations started at 19:35:51 UT on 2019-11-06 (i.e., 3.35 hr after 
the BAT trigger), and 16x200s Sloan z-band frames were obtained.

No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the XRT position 
(Page et al., GCN 26190), down to a limiting magnitude of z > 22.0 at a 
mean time of 4.0 hr post-burst, calibrated with the nearby SDSS field.
