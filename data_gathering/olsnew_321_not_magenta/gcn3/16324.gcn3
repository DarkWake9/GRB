V. D'Elia (ASDC) and L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) report on behalf of the  
Swift/XRT Team:

Swift began a series of observations, tiled on the sky, of the  
Fermi/GBM and /LAT GRB 140523A (von Kienlin et al. GCN 16321, Vianello  
et al. GCB 16322).

Observations cover four contiguous fields, starting on May 23 at 18:34  
UT, i.e., 15.5 h after the GBM detection. Each field was observed for  
about 2 ks.

A possible XRT candidate counterpart for the GBM/LAT source is  
detected at Ra, Dec 133.111250, +24.957111, which is equivalent to:

Ra(J2000)   =    08h 52m 26.7s
Dec(J2000) =  +24d 57' 25.6"

with an uncertainty of 6.4" (S/N~3). This location is 10.3 arcmins  
from the LAT position, within the LAT error box.

No statement about fading can be made at this stage.

We note the presence of a SDSS galaxy (r=22.27) a few arcsec SW to the  
center of the XRT detection, consistent with the X-ray position.
