C. Guidorzi (INAF-OAB), D. Bersier, M. Burgdorf, C.G. Mundell (LJMU)
and N. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 081109A (Immler et al. GCN Circ. 8500) with the 2m
Faulkes Telescope South starting on November 11 at 11:50:36 UT
(corresponding to 4.81 hours post burst) in the R and i' filters.
We do not detect any object at the position of the REM afterglow
(D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ 8501) down to magnitudes 21.0 and 21.2
in the R and i' filters respectively.

These upper limits are conservative however, as there is a possible
flux excess at the position of the REM afterglow but further analysis
is required to ascertain the reality of this source.

The calibration was performed using the R2 and I values of the
nearby USNOB1 star RA=22:03:01.679, Dec=-54:43:07.05 (R2=16.88, I=16.46).
