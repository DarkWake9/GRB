Moore J., Dodson R. (UWA) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160703A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 702699) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 5.5h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from only
20 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures.
No credible source was found in the BAT error box:
t0+5.5h to t0+5.6h : Rlim = 19.4

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
