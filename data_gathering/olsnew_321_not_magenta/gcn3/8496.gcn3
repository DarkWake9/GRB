report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 08:45:00.51 UT on 02 November 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered 
and located GRB 081102B (trigger 247308301/ 081102365). 
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, 
is RA = 231.2, Dec = 35.2  (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 
J2000 15h 25m, 35d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.1 degrees 
(radius, 1-sigma containment; there is additionally a systematic error 
which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53 degrees.
 
The GBM light curve shows a double peak with a duration (T90) 
of about 2.2 s (8-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from 
T0-0.226 s to T0+0.798 s (first peak) is well fit 
by a simple power law function with index -1.07 +/- 0.06 
(chi squared 247 for 243 d.o.f.). The event fluence (8-1000 keV) 
in the same time interval is (1.12 +/- 0.04)E-06 erg/cm^2. 
The 1-sec photon flux measured starting from T0-0.226 s in the 
8-1000 keV band is 3.68 +/- 0.14 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
