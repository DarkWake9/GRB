The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:21:57 UT on 3 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200403C (trigger 607648922.370564 / 200403974).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 48.8, Dec = 19.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 15m, 19d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 107.0 degrees.
