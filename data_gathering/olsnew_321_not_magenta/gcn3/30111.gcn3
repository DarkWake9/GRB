The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 17:22:13 UT on 1 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210601A (trigger 644260938.537058 / 210601724).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 277.1, Dec = -26.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 28m, -26d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 28.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 133.0 degrees.
