The on-board trigger time of Fermi GBM trigger 170817.529 524666471 
at 12:41:06.47 UT is approximately 2 seconds after the single interferometer
LIGO trigger reported in GCN 21505.

Inspection of the real-time data suggests the trigger is consistent with a
weak short GRB, location RA, Dec = 176.8, -39.8 deg (J2000).  The
statistical uncertainty on this location is 11.6 deg 
(radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, with 90% of
GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg
systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] )

The GBM localization sky map for this event is available at the Fermi Science Support Center 
and shows the uncertainty region including the systematic component:

We are producing a HEALPIX map for dissemination to the lv-em observers which should be available very shortly
and will report further analysis of this event when the science data are downlinked from the spacecraft, on a time-scale
of hours.
