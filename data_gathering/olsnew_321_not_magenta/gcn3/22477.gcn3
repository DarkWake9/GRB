P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 17:48:54 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located MAXI J1820+070 (trigger=814090).  Swift did not slew to the source
because Swift was already looking at this source. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 275.091, +7.188, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 20m 22s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 11' 17"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a few peaks
with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1100 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec after the trigger. 

Swift was observing MAXI J1820+070 when BAT triggered, at a higher merit 
than the BAT trigger. As such no prompt XRT or UVOT data are available 
for this trigger.
