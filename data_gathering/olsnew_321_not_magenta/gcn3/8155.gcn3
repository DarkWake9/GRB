Joseph D. Gelfand (NYU / NSF), Gregory Taylor (UNM), Chryssa Kouveliotou 
(NASA/MSFC), Bryan Gaensler (U. Sydney), and Alexander J. van der Horst 
(NASA/ORAU) report:

A VLA observation of SGR 0501+4516 (GCN 8113) on 2008 August 27 between 0846 UT 
and 1215 UT did not detect a radio source at the position reported in GCN 8148 
at any of the four observed frequencies.  The five sigma upper-limits on the 
radio emission during this period are:
 		   1.4 GHz	< 1 mJy    (rms = 0.2 mJy)
 		   4.8 GHz	<0.15 mJy  (rms = 30 uJy)
 		   8.5 GHz      < 0.2 mJy  (rms = 40 uJy)
 		   22 GHz       < 1.5 mJy  (rms = 0.3 mJy)

We would like to thank NRAO for promptly scheduling these VLA observations.
