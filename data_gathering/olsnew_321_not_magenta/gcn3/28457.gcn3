The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:38:51 UT on 19 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200919B (trigger 622215536.063538 / 200919569).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 55.5, Dec = 35.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 42m, 35d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 105.0 degrees.
