D. A. Perley, J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), and J. X. Prochaska (UCO/Lick)
report:

The line that states:

"If this source is associated with GRB 080319B this would be extremely 
unusual behavior for a short gamma-ray burst."

Should of course read:

"If this source is associated with GRB 080503 this would be extremely 
unusual behavior for a short gamma-ray burst."

We apologize for any confusion, and thank R. Chornock for pointing out 
the error.
