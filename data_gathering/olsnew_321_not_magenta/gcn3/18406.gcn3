report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 09:54:57.83 on October 06, 2015, Fermi-LAT detected  high-energy emission
from GRB 151006A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 465818101;
Roberts et al. GCN 18404)  and Swift-BAT  (Kocevski et al. GCN 18398).

The GBM location was initially inside the LAT field of view  at an angle of ~30 degrees
to the LAT boresight.  Using the LAT Low Energy (LLE) data selection, over 400 counts above
background were detected within a 30 s interval coinciding with the time of the GBM emission.
This data selection has insufficient spatial resolution to provide a reliable LAT localization.
Processing and analysis of standard data is ongoing.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is
Masanori Ohno (ohno@hep01.hepl.hiroshima-u.ac.jp<mailto:ohno@hep01.hepl.hiroshima-u.ac.jp>).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
