GROWTH collaborations

We report on Target of Opportunity follow-up imaging and spectroscopy
of the red transient DG19vkgf found in DECam imaging (Goldstein et
al., GCN #24257; Andreoni et al., GCN #24268) of the localization
region of S190426c (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration, GCN #24237). Spectra were obtained using the Double
Beam Spectrograph (DBSP; Oke & Gunn 1982) on the Hale 200-inch
telescope (P200) at Palomar observatory. We also obtained follow-up
imaging of the source with the Wafer Scale Imager for Prime (WASP) on
P200.

Due to the high airmass of the observation and poor seeing, the
transient is not clearly identified in the trace, but we confirm a
host redshift of z = 0.04 from the host emission lines. However, the
source is clearly detected in the images taken in i-band with WASP.

We thank the staff of the Palomar observatory for facilitating these
observations.
