The short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 141011 (Fermi-GBM detection: von 
Kienlin, GCN Circ. 16905; IPN triangulation: Golenetskii et al., GCN 
Circ. 16906) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=24377.666 s UT (06:46:17.666).

The burst light curve shows a short pulse with
a total duration of ~0.1 s.
The emission is seen up to ~4 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB141011_T24377/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.24(-0.20,+0.02)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 2-ms peak flux, measured from T0-0.012 s,
of 7.1(-1.7,+0.7)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1.2 MeV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.014 s to T0+0.048 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) yields
alpha = 0.1(-0.4, +0.4), and
Ep = 521(-75,+120) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
