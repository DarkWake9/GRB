E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Shulga, A. Volnova (SAI MSU), V. Kouprianov (GAO), A.
Pozanenko (IKI)  on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the afterglow of GRB070208  (Guidorzi et al., GCN 6077, Fox et
al., GCN 6078, Bloom GCN  6079) in R-band on Feb.8 with 1.5m telescope of
Sayan observatory. A set of 300 s exposures was obtained between  (UT) 15:43
and 19:28 (Klunko et al., GCN 6093). Best combined image of total exposure
4200 s is centered at Feb. 7.785. After mask subtraction of the nearby
galaxy in the best combined image we estimate OT magnitude as following:

Mid time (UT), Exposure,  R_mag
Feb. 7.785     14x300 s   21.4 +/- 0.2

The photometry is  based on USNO A2.0 stars. The mask subtracted image can
be found in http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB070208/
