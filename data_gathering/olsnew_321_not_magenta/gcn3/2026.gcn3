GRB030329a (GCN 1779) was also detected by Konus-Wind at 11:37:29.354 UT
Preliminary data analysis gives the following characteristics:
  - fluence in 15-5000 keV range = 1.6x10-4 erg cm-2 (for 35 seconds)
  - peak flux in 15-5000 keV range = 2.5x10-5 erg cm-2 s-1
  - Ep (at maximum intensity) = 150 keV
  - Ep (time integrated spectrum) = 90 keV
