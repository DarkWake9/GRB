SUBJECT: GRB 201015A: 6 GHz VLA radio afterglow candidate detection

W. Fong, G. Schroeder, J. Rastinejad, and A. Hajela (Northwestern) report:

"We observed the position of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCN 28632; Markwardt et al., GCN 28658) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2020 Oct 17.364 UT (1.41 days post-burst) at a mean frequency of 6 GHz.

We detect a bright, uncatalogued radio source with a flux density of ~0.13 milliJy at the position:

RA(J2000) = 23:37:16.41
Dec(J2000) = +53:24:56.4

with an uncertainty of ~0.3" in each coordinate. This position is consistent with optical afterglow position reported by NOT (Malesani et al., GCN 28637), and the XRT position (Evans et al. GCN 28647). We propose this source as the radio afterglow of GRB 201015A.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly approving and executing these observations."
