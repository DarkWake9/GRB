Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130206A (trigger #547918)
(De Pasquale, et al., GCN Circ. 14181).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 140.387, -58.193 deg which is
     RA(J2000)  =  09h 21m 32.9s
     Dec(J2000) = -58d 11' 35.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 52%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows two clusters of peaks. The first runs from
approximately T-10 sec to T+15 sec and the second from T+20 sec to T+60 sec,
though the count rate does not return to baseline between the two clusters.
Each of these clusters consists of multiple sub-peaks.  There is also some
low-level emission extending out to T+150 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is
128.0 +- 50.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from -12.78 to 147.21 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.56 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+42.72 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
0.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
