IPN Triangulation of GRB 130812B (long/bright)

K. Hurley and J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER NS GRB team,

S. Golenetskii, R. Aptekar, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks,
D. Svinkin, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Yamaoka, M. Ohno, Y. Hanabata, Y. Fukazawa, T. Takahashi, M. Tashiro,
Y. Terada, T. Murakami, and K. Makishima, on behalf of the Suzaku WAM
team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, N. Gehrels, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer, on
behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration, soft spectrum, intense GRB 130812B has been observed 
by Konus-Wind, Suzaku (WAM), MESSENGER (GRNS), and Swift (BAT), so far, 
at about 39315 s UT (10:55:15). The burst was outside the coded field of 
view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
     7.671 (00h 30m 41s) -79.083 (-79d 04' 59")
  Corners:
     1.389 (00h 05m 33s) -80.672 (-80d 40' 18")
     3.895 (00h 15m 35s) -80.482 (-80d 28' 56")
    12.167 (00h 48m 40s) -77.409 (-77d 24' 32")
    10.472 (00h 41m 53s) -77.656 (-77d 39' 21")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2954 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 3.8 deg (the minimum one is 14 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 112 deg.

This box can be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
