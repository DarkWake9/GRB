A. von Kienlin (MPE), E. Bissaldi (MPE), M.S. Briggs (UAHuntsville) and C.
Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 11:46:32 UT on 01 November 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and located an
event (trigger 247232793 / 081101491) which was also seen by SWIFT
(Stamatikos et al. 2008, GCN 8457, Barthelmy et al. 2008, GCN 8458). The GBM
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve shows a single peak with duration of about 224 ms. The
event is significantly detected with GBM between 40 - 200 keV. The
time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.103 s to T0+0.121 s is best fit by a single
power law with index -1.14 +/- 0.07 (chi squared 212 for 234 d.o.f.). The
event fluence (50-300 keV) in the same time interval is (1.6 +/- 0.08) E-07
erg/cm^2. 

The Swift team suggested that the event could be a possible new Soft Gamma
Repeater (SGR 0623-0006). The GBM spectrum is more consistent with that of a
faint short GRB; the lack of photons below 40 keV is rather unusual for an
SGR. 

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results
will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
