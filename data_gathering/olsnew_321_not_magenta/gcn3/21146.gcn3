and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170511A (Takao et al., GCN Circ. 21137;
Fermi-GBM trigger #516175156) was detected by the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM).  The burst signal was only seen
by the SGM instrument.  Since the detection significance is less than
7 sigma in the CGBM data, no on-board trigger occurred for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows two separated peaks.  The initial peak
starts at T+25 sec, peaks at T+28 sec and ends at T+33 sec (T is the trigger
time of Fermi-GBM).  The second peak starts at T+35 sec, peaks at T+38 sec
and ends at T+40 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is
12.5 +- 1.0 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
