P. Schady (MPE, Garching) reports:

We note a mistake in the position reported for source #2 in Schady et al.
(GCN #22777), which should have been

RA = 14:06:04.69
Dec = -43:04:17.7

There was also a mistake in our reference to Thoene et al. which should be
GCN #22775, rather than GCN #2275.

We apologise for any confusion that this error may have caused.
