on behalf of the Swift team:

At 17:11:53 UT Swift-BAT triggered on a burst GRB 050331, and 
automatically slewed.  A few of the standard GCN/Swift Notices were 
delayed, because
this burst occurred during a regular Malindi telemetry downlink session.
The BAT-derived position is RA,Dec=140.771,-41.430 (J2000).  We note this
is 91 arcsec from the XRT Position GCN Notice.  The lightcurve
has some low-significance peaks for the first ~15 sec, then two peaks
at T+15 and T+18 sec (of 1 and 2 sec duration, resp.) with a total
burst duration of ~20 sec.  The peak count rate is ~1000 cnts/sec.
