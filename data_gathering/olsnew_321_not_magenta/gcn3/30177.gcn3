Y.-D. Hu, T.-R. Sun, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado, M.D. Caballero-Garcia, M. A. Castro Tirado (IAA-CSIC), C. Perez del Pulgar, A. Castellon, I. Carrasco (Univ. de Malaga), R. Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC) and M. Jelinek (ASU-CAS), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

The 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) automatically responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 210610B (Page et al. GCNC 30170). Images were taken starting after the twilight as soon as it was possible. In the first co-added 7 x 10 s exposure image, we detect the reported optical afterglow with r = 17.5+-0.2 at 20:27 UT (~0.6 hr after trigger), also pinpointed by UVOT/Swift (Page et al. GCNC 30170), MASTER (Lipunov et al. GCNC 30173) and GIT (Kumar et al. GCNC 30174). Further observations are ongoing.

We thank the staff at La Mayora for its excellent support.
