The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 08:49:40 UT on 15 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220715A (trigger 679567785.342096 / 220715368).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 171.2, Dec = -31.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 24m, -31d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 108.0 degrees.
