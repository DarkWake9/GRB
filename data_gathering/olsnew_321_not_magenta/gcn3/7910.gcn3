report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:13:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080701 (trigger=315615).  Swift did not immediately slew
due to an Earth limb constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 45.837, +75.492 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 03m 21s
   Dec(J2000) = +75d 29' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a smooth peak
structure with a duration of ~15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Swift was unable to slew to the source due to due to Earth limb
constraints. X-ray telescope and UV/optical telescope observations of
this region will become possible at T+50 minutes. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. C. Stroh (stroh AT astroh.org). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
