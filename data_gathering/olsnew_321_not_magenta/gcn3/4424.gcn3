on behalf of the Swift team:

We correct the trigger time for GRB 060102 (trigger=175603)
in GCN Circular #4423.  A data corruption problem caused 
the conversion from spacecraft time to Universal Time to be off 
by 16 million seconds.  The correct trigger time for GRB 060102 
is 21:17:28 UT (+/- ~2 sec for the unknown correction factor).

[GCN OPS NOTE(03feb06): per author's request, "E.Retter" was changed to "A.Retter".]
