Bhalerao(IITB), G. C. Anupama(IIA), S. Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the
GIT team:

We observed GRB 210306A detected by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (V. D'Elia
et. al., GCN 29597) and optical afterglow confirmed by (Alan M. Watson et.
al., GCN 29598), with the 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We
obtained multiple
exposures in the r' filter. We clearly detected the afterglow in our stacked
image at R.A. = 08:39:49.99, DEC. = +60:12:19.09. The photometric results
follow as:

--------------------------------------------------------

 JD (mid) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Filter | Magnitude (AB) |

--------------------------------------------------------

2459280.20139 | 12.9 | r' | 20.87 +/0.05 |

--------------------------------------------------------

The magnitude is in agreement with that reported by Z.P. Zhu et al., (GCN
29607), around the same time of our observation. The magnitudes are
calibrated against PanSTARRS (Flewelling et al., 2018) and not corrected
for galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
