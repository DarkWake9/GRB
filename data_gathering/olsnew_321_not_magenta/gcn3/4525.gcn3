K.L. Page, M.R. Goad, A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU),
A. Smale (NASA HQ) and L.  Cominsky (Sonoma State U.) report on behalf of
the Swift-XRT Team:

Swift performed a Target of Opportunity observation of GRB 060110 once it 
came out of the Moon constraint, approximately 2.4e5 seconds (2.8 days) 
after the BAT trigger (Zane et al., GCN 4463).

A faint, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source was identified at a position 
of:

RA(J2000)  =  04h 50m 57.85s
Dec(J2000) = +28d 25' 53.88"

with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcsec (90% containment, including the latest
XRT boresight correction). This is 0.7" from the position given by Torii
in GCN 4468 for a potential, low signal-to-noise source and 6.9"  from the
IR position in GCN 4467 (Bloom & Li). The XRT position is also 21 arcsec
from the refined BAT position (Parsons et al., GCN 4477)

Using 41.7 ks of data, the source is fading with a decay slope of alpha =
2.0 +/- 1.2. The spectrum can be modelled with a power-law of Gamma = 2.27
+/- 0.58, with absorption consistent with the Galactic value in this
direction (2.4e21 cm^-2). The time averaged 0.3-10 keV observed
(unabsorbed) flux between 2.4e5 and 4.8e5 seconds is 6.45e-14 (1.13e-13)
erg cm^-2 s^-1.
