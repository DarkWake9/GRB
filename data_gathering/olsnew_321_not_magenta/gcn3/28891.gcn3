Swift observed the field of IceCube 201114A (GCN Circ. 28887) between 16:50:06
2020 November 14 and 21:26:27 on 2020 November 14, collecting a total of 3.7 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found 2 X-ray sources, as detailed below. All of these are unknown but with
count rate consistent with the previous non-detections. We therefore do not
claim any of them as the likely counterpart to IceCube 201114A.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 8-10 x 10^-3 ct/sec.

The detected sources were:

Source no:   1
RA (J2000):  104.52092 [degrees] = 06h 58m 05.02s
Dec (J2000): +5.8679 [degrees] = +05d 52' 04.3"
Error:       +5.5 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 4.1 (+3.9, -2.4) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       1.8 (+1.7, -1.0) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1


Source no:   2
RA (J2000):  104.92274 [degrees] = 06h 59m 41.46s
Dec (J2000): +5.7601 [degrees] = +05d 45' 36.4"
Error:       +6.6 [arcsec, 90% conf. radius]
Count rate (0.3-10 keV): 8 (+5, -3) x 10-3 ct s-1
Flux (0.3-10 keV):       3.3 (+2.1, -1.5) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1
