Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160705B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 703176) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 92s after the GRB trigger
(18s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
36 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were poor.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+92s to t0+152s : Rlim = 15.5

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+190s to t0+250s : Rlim = 16.6

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
