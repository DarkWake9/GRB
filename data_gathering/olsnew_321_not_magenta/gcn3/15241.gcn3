A. Volnova (IKI),  V. Nevskiy (ISON),  I. Molotov (KIAM), Yu. Krugly(IA 
KhNU), I. Slyusarev (IA KhNU), A. Pozanenko (IKI)  report on behalf of 
larger collaboration:

After the refined analysis of the ISON-Kislovodsk observations (Volnova 
et al., GCN 15171) of GRB 130903A field (Mereghetti et al., GCN 15169) 
in the coordinates of OT reported by Tanga et al. (GCN 15177) we found a 
faint source with a R magnitude 20.40 ± 0.3. Photometry is  based on the 
  stars reported below.

We also observed the field of the field with AZT-8 (0.7m) telescope of 
Institute of Astronomy, Kharkiv National University starting on Sep. 03 
(UT) 01:38:52. We took 11 frames with exposures of 120 seconds in R 
filter. On the stacked image within 1.5 arcmin of error circle 
localization (Mereghetti et al., GCN 15169) we do not detect any
source.

Photometry of combined image is the following

(UT) mid (d)     (s)

01:38:52 0.03579 11*120 R       >20.0

and based on SDSS stars, R (gri -> R transformations by Lupton 2005):
