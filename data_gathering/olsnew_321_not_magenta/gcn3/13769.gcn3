Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120913A (trigger #533568)
(Helder, et al., GCN Circ. 13762).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 146.400, 26.959 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 45m 36.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 57' 32.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 71%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows three slightly overlapping FRED peaks
starting at ~T-5 sec, peaking at ~T+1, ~T+23, & ~T+40 sec, and ending at ~T+42 sec.
Due to a slew, the burst location left the BAT FoV at ~T+115 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 30.1 +- 4.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.72 to T+39.80 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.18 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.7 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+22.45 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
