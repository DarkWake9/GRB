A. Zauderer, G. Petitpas and E. Berger (Harvard/CfA) report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 110719A (GCN #12173) with the SMA at 345 GHz starting 
on 2011 July 19.6 (7.5 hours after the burst) for a total integration 
time on source of 4.6 hours.  No counterpart is detected within the XRT 
error circle (GCN #12176) to a 3-sigma upper limit of 2.1 mJy/bm.

We acknowledge and thank the SMA observatory staff for their support
of these rapid response observations."
