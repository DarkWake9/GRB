ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB  
090418 (Swift trigger 349510; Mangano et al, GCN 9149) in twilight.  
The first image was at 11:07:59.2 UT, 19.0 s after the burst (4.2 s  
after the GCN notice time). The unfiltered images are calibrated  
relative to USNO B1.0.
We detect the optical counterpart at the KAIT and UVOT position  
(Chornock et al. GCN 9148;  Mangano et al, GCN 9149) at the following  
magnitude and limit:
