TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5042
SUBJECT: GRB060501: Swift XRT position
DATE:    06/05/01 15:05:02 GMT
FROM:    Eleonora Troja at INAF-IASFPA  <nora@ifc.inaf.it>

V. La Parola (INAF-IASFPa), E. Troja (INAF-IASFPa),
G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), D. N. Burrows (PSU) and
J. Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT Team:

The XRT attempted to centroid on GRB 060501 at 09:10:08 UT, 
3309 s after the burst. However, at this late time the burst 
was too faint for an on-board detection in the 2.5 s centroiding 
image, and the XRT switched immediately to PC mode.

Using the first 4.5 ksec data set from the Malindi download,
we find a single weak previously uncatalogued source within the 
BAT error box at:

RA:    21 53 29.9  (J2000)
Dec:  +43 59 53.4 (J2000)

with 5.5 arcsec uncertainty (90% confinement).
The estimated flux is 2.6e-13 erg/sec/cm2, assuming Galactic 
absorption and a power law spectrum with photon index 2.0.
This source is 58 arcsec from the BAT on-board position.

The available data do not allow us to establish if this
source is fading.
