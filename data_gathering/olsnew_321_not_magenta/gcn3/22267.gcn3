and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 171210A (Bissaldi et al., GCN circ. 22228; Poolakkil et al.,
GCN circ. 22233; Kozlova et al., GCN circ. 22244) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:49:17.22 on 10 December 2017.  The burst signal was seen
by all the instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing
scripts, the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single FRED-like pulse. The emission starts
at T-5 sec, peaks at T+5 sec and ends at T+50 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 47.4 +- 2.5 sec (40-1000 keV).

The emission is seen up to ~T+180 s in the low energy ranges of the HXM data.

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
