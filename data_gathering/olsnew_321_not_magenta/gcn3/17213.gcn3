Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141221A (trigger #622006)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 17206).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 198.283, 8.197 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 13m 07.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = +08d 11' 49.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows some low-level precursor emission
starting at ~T-23 sec with the first peak starting at ~T-3 sec, peaking
at ~T+1 sec, and the second peak peaking at ~T+14 sec, and ending at T+35 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 36.9 +- 4.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-24.11 to T+20.33 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.74 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.1 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
