TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  604
SUBJECT: GRB 000301C, Optical Observation

J. P. Halpern & J. Kemp (Columbia U.) report on behalf of
the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We reobserved GRB 000301C in the R band on March 9.52 UT using 
the MDM 1.3m telescope, measuring R = 22.28 +/- 0.09 referenced
to the comparison stars of Garnavich et al. (GCN #573).  Seeing
was 1."4.  If we restrict our attention to those GCN reported
magnitudes that have error bars less than or equal to 0.1 mag,
then the light curve is reasonably well described by a power-law
decay of alpha = -0.90 +/- 0.04 until 4 days after the burst,
followed by a power-law decay of alpha = -1.93 +/- 0.12.

An updated decay curve and a new CCD image are posted at
