and R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift
Team:

At 06:49:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120817A (trigger=531267).  Swift could not immediately slew
due to an Earth limb pointing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 250.706, -38.340 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 42m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = -38d 20' 25"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multiple-peaked
structure with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.1
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B.P. Gompertz (bpg6 AT le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
