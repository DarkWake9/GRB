DATE:    04/04/22 08:05:12 GMT
FROM:    Diego Gotz at IASF-CNR  <diego@mi.iasf.cnr.it>

S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), J. Borkowski, M. Beck (ISDC) on
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team, S. Shaw and R. Walter on behalf of
the INTEGRAL Science data Centre (ISDC) and the INTEGRAL Science Working
Team report:

An 8 s long GRB has been detected with the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System
(IBAS) on April 22 at 06:58:02 UT. The GRB has been detected with
IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-200 keV band. Its coordinates (J2000)  are:

R.A.  18h 42m 00s
Dec. +01deg 59' 29''

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin.

The preliminary peak flux in the 20-200 keV range is about 2.7
photons/cmsq/s (2.5 x 10^-7 erg/cmsq/s) (1 s integration time).
