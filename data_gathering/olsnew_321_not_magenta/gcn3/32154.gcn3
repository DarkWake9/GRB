report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 20:32:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR J1935+2154 (trigger=1108538). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 293.714, +21.901 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 34m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 54' 04"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 0.3 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~110,000 counts/sec (on a 64 ms timescale, 15-350 keV), at
~0 sec after the trigger. 

An XRT and UVOT observation of SGR J1935+2154 is scheduled for 
21:50-22:18 UT (target ID 33349).    

This source was last seen to be active by BAT in a series of  
at least 36 bursts during the period Jan 9-18, 2022.
