The long GRB 180626A (Swift-BAT trigger #844615: Evans et al.,
GCN 22850; Krimm et al., GCN 22862;
INTEGRAL detection: Gotz et al., GCN 22851)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single emission episode
with a duration of ~ 36 s.

As observed by KW, the burst had a fluence of
7.21(-0.79,+0.97)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)-3.841 s, of 3.92(-0.49,+0.58)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0(BAT)-9.7 s to ~T0(BAT)+25.6 s)
by a simple power-law model yields a power law
index of -2.19(-0.04,+0.05), chi2 = 2.5/1 dof.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
