D. Roberts, M.Morrell & U. Kolb (The Open University) reporting on behalf of the PIRATE group:

We observed 99 separate fields in two different regions of the G275404 bayestar skymap using our 0.43m robotic telescope at Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Spain. We acquired over 400 images across the first 6 nights of observations, all images were obtained using the R filter and 60s exposure length. Initial observations began at 2017-02-25T22:17:50, approximately 5 hours after the initial GCN alert was received. A detailed list of all the fields observed can be found on GraceDB under the EMObservations tab. Each FoV was 0.7x0.7 degrees centred around the given coordinates. Analysis is ongoing.
