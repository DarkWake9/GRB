In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event S190707q at T0 = 2019-07-07 09:33:26 (UT),
a preliminary analysis of the AGILE minicalorimeter (MCAL) triggered data found no
event candidates within a time interval covering -/+ 15 sec from the LIGO/Virgo T0.

At the T0, about 80% of the S190707q 90% c.l. localization region was accessible to
the AGILE-MCAL. Three-sigma upper limits (ULs) are obtained for a 1 s integration
time at different celestial positions within the accessible S190707q localization
region, from a minimum of 1.4E-06 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 6.7E-06 erg cm^-2 (assuming
as spectral model a single power law with photon index 1.5).

The AGILE-MCAL detector is a CsI detector with a 4 pi FoV, sensitive in the energy
range 0.4-100 MeV. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
