P.A. Evans, J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), D.N. Burrows (PSU) and S.D.
Barthelmy (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT team announce the release of a repository of GRB XRT 
spectra, available online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra. This 
repository is analogous to the light curve repository; spectra are built 
and updated automatically and posted online within minutes of data 
becomming available. These spectra will shortly be available through the 
GCN Ground-Analysis Information page 
(http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/swift_gnd_ana.html). The reliability of these 
spectra has been confirmed by the XRT team. You are welcome to use these 
spectra. Please see the full documentation, including the usage policy, at 
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra/docs.php. A paper describing their 
production will be forthcoming.

We have also implemented upgrades to the GRB light curve repository 
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/). Users may now: 1) rebin the light 
curves, 2) change the minimum number of counts and duration of the bins, 
and 3) define the energy ranges and grade selection criteria. In addition, 
the source and background event lists used to create the lightcurves are 
available for download using the links at the foot of each GRB's light 
curve page. These event lists contain extra information, such as the 
radius of the source region and the radius of any excluded, piled up 
region, for each event. The online documentation provides full details.
