Swift Team:

At 01:04:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140614A (trigger=601646).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 231.232, -79.095 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 15h 24m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = -79d 05' 41"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, the
immediately-available light curve does not show significant
variation. 

The XRT began observing the field at 01:07:03.1 UT, 123.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
231.1723, -79.1291 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 15h 24m 41.34s
   Dec(J2000) = -79d 07' 44.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 129 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.26
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 7.34e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 131 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically
complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.12. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (kpa AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
