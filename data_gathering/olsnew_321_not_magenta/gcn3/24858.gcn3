Using combination of INTEGRAL all-sky detectors (following Savchenko et al. 2017, A&A 603, A46): SPI/ACS, IBIS/Veto, and IBIS, we have performed a search for a prompt gamma-ray counterpart of IceCube-190619A (GCN 24854).

At the time of the event (2019-06-19 13:14:18 UTC, hereafter T0), INTEGRAL was operating in nominal mode. The peak of the event localization probability was at an angle of 46 deg with respect to the spacecraft pointing axis. This orientation implies strongly suppressed (21% of optimal) response of ISGRI, somewhat suppressed (41% of optimal) response of IBIS/Veto, and near-optimal (79% of optimal) response of SPI-ACS.

The background within +/-300 seconds around the event was rather stable (excess variance 1.2).

We have performed a search for any impulsive events in INTEGRAL SPI-ACS (as described in Savchenko et al. 2012, A&A 541A, 122S), IBIS, and IBIS/Veto data.

We do not detect any significant counterparts and estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 2e-07 erg/cm^2 (within the 50% probability containment region of the source localization) for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T0. For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived peak flux upper limit is ~1.7e-07 (6.7e-08) erg/cm^2/s at 1 s (8 s) time scale in 75-2000 keV energy range.
