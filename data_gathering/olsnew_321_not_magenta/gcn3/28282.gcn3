S. Dichiara (NASA/GSFC/UMCP), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
and K. L. Page (U Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift team:

Using the full data set from recent downlinks, we report further ground
data analysis for Swift trigger 992444 (Dichiara et al. GCN Circ. 28278).

The BAT analysis uses data from T-61 to T+242 sec. The BAT image
significance has now decreased to 4.5 sigma (15-350 keV). Also, the
mask-weighted light curve does not show anything significant.

Ground analysis of 1.8 ks of PC mode data confirms no XRT counterpart
within the BAT error circle, to a 3 sigma upper limit of 8e-3 count s^-1.

We thus conclude that this trigger was due to detector noise.
