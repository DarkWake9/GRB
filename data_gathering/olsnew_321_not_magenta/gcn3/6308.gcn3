report on behalf of EAFON team

"We have imaged the GRB 070419A field (Stamatikos et al. #6302) with
the Kiso 1.05m Schmidt telescope. The optical afterglow reported by
Chornock et al (#6304) and Cenko et al. (#6306) is visible in our B
and R band images. We also confirmed the decaying during our
observation. The afterglow brightness at 51 min after the burst is
R~20.1 mag."

Further observations and analysis are in progress.
