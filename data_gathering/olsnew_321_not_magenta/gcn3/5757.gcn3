S. B. Pandey (UCL-MSSL) & M. Stamatikos (NASA-GSFC), on behalf of the 
Swift UVOT team.

The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of long duration GRB 061025 
around ~1.5 hours after the INTEGRAL trigger at 18:35:50 UT on October 25 
(Mereghetti et al., GCN 5751). We do not find any source in the co-added 
UVOT observations within the XRT position reported by Mineo et al. (GCN 
5753).

Following are the 3-sigma magnitude upper limits from the observations.

Filter   T_start    T_stop   Exposure (s)    mag, 3 sigma UL
V         11282      39711      875           20.5
B         11112      38644      1082          21.4
U         9302       38427      1267          21.2
UVW1      8875       38210      2581          21.4
UVM2      11318      40316      2468          22.0
UVW2      11150      39494      3524          22.4

T_start and T_stop are calculated from the time of the burst. The upper 
limits are not corrected for Galactic extinction E(B-V) = 0.047 mag along
the line of sight to the burst.

to 'Mineo'.]
