collaboration:

We observed at the position of the optical transient ZTF20abwysqy reported
by Ahumada el al. (GCN Circ. 28287) as a possible afterglow candidate for
GRB 200826A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 28284, Mangan et al., GCN Circ. 28287)
and coincident with the X-ray Source 3 reported by D'Ai et al. (GCN Circ.
28300). We use the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell
Discovery Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ. Observations started on
August 29, 10:04:56 UT (3.23 days after the Fermi trigger) taking 8
exposures of 180 s each with SDSS r filter. Observations were taken at an
airmass of about 1 and seeing of 1.4".

We detect the underlying galaxy reported by Ahumada el al. (GCN Circ.
28287) with magnitude r=22.60 +/- 0.03 AB mag. We do not find any other
source at the reported position down to a 3-sigma field limit of r>24.5
AB mag.

Magnitudes are calibrated against the SDSS catalog and not corrected for
Galactic extinction.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
