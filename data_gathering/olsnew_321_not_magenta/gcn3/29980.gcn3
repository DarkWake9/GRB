We observed the field of the IceCube bronze event IceCube-210510A (IceCube
Collaboration, GCN Circ. 29976) with the DDOTI wide-field imager at the
Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Martir
(http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) from 2021-05-10 05:44 to 11:33 UTC (0.9 to 6.7
hours after the trigger) and obtained 4.5 hours of exposure in the w filter.

We observed a region covering aproximately 7 degrees in RA and 10 degrees in
declination including the entire initial uncertainty region distributed in the
GCN Notice and almost the entire updated 90% region (IceCube Collaboration, GCN
Circ. 29976) except the small part west of RA = 269.80 degrees. We calibrated
our images against the APASS catalog.

Comparing to the Pan-STARRS DR1 catalog, we detect no uncataloged point sources
to a 10-sigma limiting magnitude of w = 21.44.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
