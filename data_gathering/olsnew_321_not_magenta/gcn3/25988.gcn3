Observatory Team:

At 04:35:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 191011A (trigger=928924).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 44.724, -27.845 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 58m 54s
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 50' 40"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex peak
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 04:37:11.1 UT, 74.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 44.72679, -27.84594 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 02h 58m 54.43s
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 50' 45.4"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 9.5 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.54 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 5.8
(+3.35/-2.89) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 77 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	02:58:54.80 =  44.72832
  DEC(J2000) = -27:50:43.5  = -27.84541
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.83 arc sec. This position is 6.1
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
20.20 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.19. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
