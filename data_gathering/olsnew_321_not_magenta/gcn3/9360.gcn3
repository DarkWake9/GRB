G. G. Williams (MMTO), A. Updike (Clemson), and P. A. Milne (Steward
Observatory), on behalf of the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box
of GRB 090515 (Swift Trigger 352108, Beardmore et al. GCN 9356) at
04:45:52 UT, 43 seconds after the trigger.  Our initial observations
include 5 x 10s exposures, 5 x 20s exposures, and 30 x 60s exposures,
all in the R-band.

We do not detect any variable sources or afterglow candidates within
the XRT error box in our earliest exposure to the following 3-sigma
limiting magnitude determined using nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.  We also
do not detect any afterglow candidate in later images and sets of
combined images:
