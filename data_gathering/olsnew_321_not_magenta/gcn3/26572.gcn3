The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory
(H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) data around the time of the
compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S191222n (GCN Circular 26543).
Parameter estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and
a new sky map, LALInference.fits.gz,0, distributed via GCN Notice, is
available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S191222n

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz,0. For the
LALInference.fits.gz,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is 1850 deg2.
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance
estimate is 2518 +/- 679 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation).
