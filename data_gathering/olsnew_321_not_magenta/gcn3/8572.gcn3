We began to observe GRB081128 (Margutti et al., GCN 8571) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at 17:25:16(UT),6min32s 
after the burst.A series of white, R band have been obtained.
After combined 10*20s white band data (without bias,flat-field
correction) and made a preliminary analysis,
a marginal object within the 
errorbar of XRT was detected with an estimated 
brightness of R ~ 20.9+/- 0.44 calibrated to USNO-B1.0,
at the mean time of 500s after the burst.

We are not sure whether it is the OT or not, because of 
lack of flat images at the moment. 
We will reduce it tomorrow and give a more precise 
result and analysis.
