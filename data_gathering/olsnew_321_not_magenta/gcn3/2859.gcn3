E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and S. Gonzalez (Las Campanas
Observatory) report:

"We imaged the 12-arcmin radius error circle of GRB 041217 (GCN 2853) with
the Swope 40-inch telescope at Las Campanas Observatory starting on
December 18.304 (nearly 24 hours after the burst) in r-band for a total of
12 minutes.  A comparison to DSS reveals no new bright objects.  However,
four faint objects close to the detection limit of the DSS are detected
with no counterparts in the DSS.  We urge other observers to examine their
images at the positions of these four candidates:

Can-1:
        RA = 10:58:44.19
        DEC= -17:49:34.6

Can-2:
        RA = 10:59:38.06
        DEC= -17:53:02.0

Can-3:
        RA = 10:59:15.55
        DEC= -18:05:35.6

Can-4:
        RA = 10:59:06.83
        DEC= -18:06:58.2

Continued observations are planned."
