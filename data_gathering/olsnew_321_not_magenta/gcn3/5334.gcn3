Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060714 (trigger #219101)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 5311).  The BAT ground-calculated position is RA,Dec
= 227.854, -6.545 deg {15h 11m 24.9s, -6d 32' 42.3"} (J2000) +- 1.5 arcmin,
(radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 27%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurves show an initial triangular-shapped peak
starting at T-15 sec, peaking at T_zero, and ending at T+55.  Then come
two peaks, each about 20 sec FWHM, peaking at T+76 and T+90 sec; the last peak
ending at T+120 sec.  We note that the XRT follow-up observation does not start
until the trailing edge of the second peak.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 115 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.3 to T+120.6 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.99 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+75.42 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

We apologize for the long delay in issuing this standard BAT Second Circular.
