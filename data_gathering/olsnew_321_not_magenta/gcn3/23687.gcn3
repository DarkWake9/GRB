A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI), D. A. Kann, L. Izzo, 
C. C. Thoene, M. Blazek, K. Bensch (all HETH/IAA-CSIC), and F. Aceituno 
(IAA-CSIC) report:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 190114A (Siegel & LaPorte, GCN 
#23678), detected by Swift (LaPorte et al., GCN #23677), with the T150 
telescope of the Sierra Nevada Observatory (OSN). We obtained 5 x 360 s 
images in the Ic band at 16.98 hours after the GRB. The afterglow is 
well-detected in each single image.

Magnitudes are given in the AB system. They were measured vs. four 
Pan-STARRS comparison stars, using the transformation equations of 
Lupton (2005), and transformed back into AB mags.
