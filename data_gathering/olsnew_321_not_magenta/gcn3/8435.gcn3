T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 01:43:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 081029 (trigger=332931).  Swift could not immediately slew
to the burst due to an Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 346.704, -68.160 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 23h 06m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = -68d 09' 34"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for an image trigger, 
the BAT light curve shows nothing remarkable. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+41.3 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
that time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. Sakamoto (Taka.Sakamoto AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
