SUBJECT: GRB 070220: ART-3 Optical and NIR limits

K. Torii, S. Tanaka, and H. Tsunemi (Osaka U.) report:

 The error region of GRB 070220 (Stamatikos et al. GCN 6114;
Beardmore et al. GCN 6118) was observed with the 14 inch
ART-3a and 0.35 m ART-3b, both located in Toyonaka, Osaka.

 The imaging started at 2007 Feb. 20, 09:27:03 UT (4.7 hours
after the burst) in Ic band (ART-3a), and at 09:55:44 UT in
J band (ART-3b equipped with thermoelectrically cooled
InGaAs array). We do not detect neither optical nor near
infrared counterpart for the X-ray afterglow (GCN 6114,
6118), and derive the following 3 sigma upper limits
relative to USNO-B1.0 I2 and 2MASS J magnitudes.
