report:

Error box of GRB030328 (HETE Trigger #2650, GCN 1978) was observed with
1.5-m Russian-Turkish Telescope RTT150 at Bakyrlytepe (TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey) between Mar. 28.80 and 29.02 UT, starting appr.
9-10 hours after the burst. A set of 300-second exposures in BVRI Bessel
filters was obtained under poor photometric conditions.

We confirm the presence of the optical transient (OT) reported by
Peterson and Price (GCN 1974). R magnitude of the OT on Mar. 28.952
(0.480 day after the burst) is estimated to be 20.35, assuming that Star
B in GCN 1975 is R=16.1. This is brighter than the extrapolation of the
power law from Price and Peterson (GCN 1977).

OT is clearly visible in other filters in every 300-s exposure. The
magnitudes in BVI will be obtained after we calibrate the field.
