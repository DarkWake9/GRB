Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150626B (trigger #646786)
(McCauley et al., GCN Circ. 17966).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 187.627, 66.794 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  12h 30m 30.6s
  Dec(J2000) = +66d 47' 39.6"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 35%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-peaked structure that starts
at ~T-15 s, peaks at ~T+1 s, and ends at ~T+30 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 48.0 +- 22.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.6 to T+32.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.36 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.94 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
