TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  683
SUBJECT: GRB000528: BeppoSAX NFI follow-up preliminary analysis
DATE:    00/05/31 17:34:20 GMT
FROM:    Giangiacomo Gandolfi at IAS/CNR Frascati  <gandolfi@ias.rm.cnr.it>

A BeppoSAX follow up of GRB000528 with the Narrow Field Instruments
started around May 28 at 20:50 UT, i.e. about 12 hours after the GRB.

Preliminary analysis of the MECS (1.6-10 keV) data shows
two previously unknown sources inside the field. The preliminary WFC error
box (BeppoSAX Mail #10) contains both objects, while the refined one
(BeppoSAX Mail #11 and GCN 677) only the second.

Object #1:

R.A.(2000)= 161.365
DEC(2000)= -33.975

Object #2:

R.A.(2000)= 161.287
DEC(2000)= -33.986

both with  an error radius of 1.5'.

The source #1 is possibly fading, while the #2 seems to be consistent with
a constant flux. Further and more detailed analysis are in progress.
