Operation Center, Rome, report:  "The 2'.5 error box of GRB 001109
provided by the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras was observed with
the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments from Nov. 10.0762 (16.5 hr
after the gamma-ray burst) to 10.9847 UT.  A previously unknown
source lying inside the error box has been detected by the Medium
Energy Concentrator Spectrometer.  The source, designated 1SAX
J1830.1+5517, is located at R.A. = 18h30m07s.8, Decl. = +55o17'56"
(equinox 2000.0; error radius 50") and has an average count rate of
0.00914 +/- 0.0007 count/s in the two MECS units, corresponding to
a 2-10-keV flux of (7.1 +/- 0.5) x 10**-13 erg cm**-2 s**-1.  The
flux decreases by a factor of about 2 during the first 20 000 s of
the observation.  Due to its fading behavior, 1SAX J1830.1+5517 is
likely the x-ray afterglow of GRB 001109.  We remark that the
position of this source is consistent with that of the previously
unknown radio source detected in the GRB 001109 error box by Taylor
et al. (GCN 880).  A second BeppoSAX NFI observation of the field
is in progress."
