TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  5771
SUBJECT: GRB 061028: MDM Observations

N. Mirabal (Columbia U.), R. J. Assef &  K. Schlesinger (OSU) report on
behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We observed the Swift error circle of GRB 061028 (Sakamoto et al., GCN 
5762)
in r', i', and z' bands using the RETROCAM imager on the MDM 2.4m
telescope starting on October 28 06:47 UT, 5.35 hours after the trigger.
A summed 45-minute exposure in i' reveals no new object in the refined
XRT error circle (Cusumano et al., GCN 5767) down to I ~ 21.5 relative
to the USNO-B1.0 catalog. We clearly detect sources S1 (Bloom et al.,
GCN 5768) and S2 (Cenko et al., GCN 5770)  at a preliminary magnitude of
I ~ 21.0 for both objects, consistent with the measurements reported by
Cenko et al (GCN 5770).  Results of additional bands will be reported
subsequently.

This message may be cited."
