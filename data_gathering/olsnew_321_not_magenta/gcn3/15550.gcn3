K. Hurley on behalf of the IPN team, report:

The short-duration, hard spectrum, bright GRB 131126A has been observed 
by Fermi (GBM: trigger 407130853) and Konus-Wind, so far, at about 14050 
s UT (03:54:10).

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=219.687 deg (14h 38m 45s)  Dec(2000)=-12.489 deg (-12d 29' 
20"), whose radius is 65.710 Â± 0.084 deg (3 sigma).

Combined with the GBM 1-sigma statistical+systematic error contour, this 
constrains the arrival direction to that portion of the annulus between 
RA, Dec = 206.1, +52.1 and 222.6, +53.2 degrees.

A triangulation map is posted at

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
