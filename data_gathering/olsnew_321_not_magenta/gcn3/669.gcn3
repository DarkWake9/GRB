M. R. Metzger (Caltech) and A. Fruchter (STScI) report:

"The suggested afterglow candidate for GRB 000418 (Klose et al. GCN645) 
 was imaged in the R band with the Keck I telescope + LRIS on UT May 6.42.
 We measure R = 23.57 +- 0.10 for the object at this epoch. When combined
 with the photometry of Mirabal et al. (GCNs 646, 650, 653), this suggests
 that the decay rate has steepened to a t ^ -1.2 power law from the
 shallower slope of the early photometry.  We also note that in our stacked
 image having approx. 0".6 FWHM seeing, the candidate PSF does not appear
 extended (is consistent with a point source PSF).  This suggests that the
 continuum emission is still dominated by the afterglow, or that the
 underlying host galaxy (cf. Bloom et al. GCN 661) is compact.

 This message may be cited."
