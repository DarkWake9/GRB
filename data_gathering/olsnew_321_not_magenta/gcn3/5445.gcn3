A. Cucchiara, P. Brown, A. Moretti report on behalf of the
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began observing GRB 060813 (trigger #224364,
A. Moretti et al., GCN Circ. 5442) 83 seconds after the BAT
trigger. No optical afterglow is detected in the XRT refined error
circle (A. Moretti et al., GCN Circ. 5444).

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for the finding chart and the
coadded images for the UVOT filters are listed below:

White         83-181         98              19.46

Coadded images:

Filter          T_range (s)      Exposure (s)   3sigma UL

M2              300-22702        1613           20.86
W2              419-28770        1279           20.93

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. No correction has
been made for the Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.33 mag
(Schlegel et al. 1998) along the line of sight to the burst.
