SUBJECT: Fermi GBM observation of another bright burst in the direction of SGR 1935+2154

O.J. Roberts (USRA/NASA-MSFC) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:16:10.44 UT on 12 September 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located a bright, SGR-like burst from the direction of
the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (trigger 653170575/210912845).

The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the known position of the SGR.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 96 degrees.

The event episode has a duration (T90) of about 1 s (10-1000 keV). During this
time interval, there are several very short bursts. The first burst has a
rapid risetime.

The whole event is best fit with a power law function
with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is 0.08 +/- 0.08 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 32.1 +/- 0.3 keV.

The time-integrated event fluence (10-1000 keV) from T0-0.064 to T0+0.944s is
(3.545 +/- 0.038)E-6 erg/cm^2. The average photon flux in the
10-1000 keV band during this period is 84 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

Fermi GBM has also triggered on a further 24 bursts from the direction of SGR 1935+2154
since yesterday's GCN (Roberts and Wood, GCN 30806):

Fermi GBM will not report on future triggers from this event.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary. We encourage multi-wavelength
observations to follow-up this most recent activation.
