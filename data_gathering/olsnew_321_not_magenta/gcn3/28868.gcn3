The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 02:31:05 UT on 9 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201109A (trigger 626581870.79309 / 201109105).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 136.1, Dec = -5.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 04m, -5d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 66.0 degrees.
