TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5185
SUBJECT: GRB060526: Optical counterpart from MIRO
DATE:    06/05/30 03:02:47 GMT
FROM:    Kiran S Baliyan at Physical Research Lab, Ahmedabad,India  <baliyan@prl.res.in>

   K.S. Baliyan, S. Ganesh, H.O. Vats and  J.K. Jain (MIRO-PRL, Ahmedabad,
   India) report:
   
   We observed the field around position of the optical counterpart of 
   GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162, 5163; French & Jelinek GCN 5165; 
   Rykoff et al. GCN 5166) beginning at 21:02 UT. The 1296*1154 CCD mounted 
   on the 1.2 M telescope of Mt Abu IR Observatory, operated by Physical 
   Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad- India, was used to observe OT in VRI bands
   with 180 second exposures. 
   The afterglow is detected clearly in all the bands. 

We use Rc=16.484+/-0.01 mag for USNO B-1 star (RA=15:31:18.6, DEC=+00 17 34.9)
as reference value to estimate preliminary R magnitudes for OT on May 26:

 21:02:59 UT	  18.65 +/- 0.19
 21:09:26 UT	  18.71 +/- 0.32
 21:32:38 UT	  19.06 +/- 0.19
 22:44:22 UT	  19.19 +/- 0.24
