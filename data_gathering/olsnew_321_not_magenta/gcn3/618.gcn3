K. Hurley, E. Mazets, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, Konus-Wind,
and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, and NEAR observed a 2 s long burst at 19134 s on
March 26 2000.  Its 25-100 keV fluence was ~3x10^-6 erg/cm^2.  We
have triangulated it to an ~ 50 sq. arcmin. error box whose preliminary
coordinates are:


   RA(2000)                DEC(2000) 
22 h 11 m 23.51 s   -26 o  8 '  46.15 "  (CENTER)            
22 h 11 m 47.86 s   -26 o  8 '  46.77 "  (CORNER)
22 h 10 m 26.91 s   -26 o 12 '  53.19 "  (CORNER)
22 h 12 m 19.73 s   -26 o  4 '  37.46 "  (CORNER)
22 h 10 m 59.13 s   -26 o  8 '  45.17 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined further.
