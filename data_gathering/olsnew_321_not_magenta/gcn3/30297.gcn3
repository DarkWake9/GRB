The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:32:35 UT on 22 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210622A (trigger 646018360.939998 / 210622064).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 242.1, Dec = -14.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 08m, -14d 05'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 82.0 degrees.
