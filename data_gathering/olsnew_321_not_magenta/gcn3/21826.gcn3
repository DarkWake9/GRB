report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 07:26:17 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170906C (trigger=770981).  Swift did not slew due to an
observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 128.704, +70.782, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 34m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = +70d 46' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks
with a total duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+18.9
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. H. Siegel (siegel AT swift.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
