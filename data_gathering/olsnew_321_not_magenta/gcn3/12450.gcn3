At 17:26:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111018A (trigger=505801).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 271.500, -3.871 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 06m 00s
   Dec(J2000) = -03d 52' 16"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows two weak peaks
at T+0 and T+30 sec with a total duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 17:28:27.6 UT, 123.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. The position determined from promptly downlinked data
differs significantly from the on-board position, suggesting that the
XRT may have centroided on a cosmic ray; the initial XRT position
notice should be treated with caution. Using promptly downlinked data
we find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 271.48887,
-3.90719 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 05m 57.33s
   Dec(J2000) = -03d 54' 25.9"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 135 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.54
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 132 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
2.16.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
