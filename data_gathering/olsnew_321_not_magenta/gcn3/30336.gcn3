Barway(IIA) report on behalf of the GIT team:

We observed GRB 210626A detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #30323) with 0.7 m
GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). The GRB was also detected by Swift/BAT-GUANO (GCN
#30325) and later on, Swift-XRT detected X-ray afterglow candidate (GCN
#30329). We obtained exposures in the r' filter. We did not detect any new
source in our stacked image within the 5.7 arcsec circle, around RA:
14:46:05.83, Dec: -01:09:22.5 (GCN #30329). Further, we did not find any
new source within the 5 arcmin region identified by BAT localisation
(GCN #30325).
The obtained upper limit follow as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD (mid) | T_mid-T0(hrs) | Exposure (sec) | Filter | Lim_mag (5-sigma) |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2459392.2353 | 9.37 | 2 x 300 (stacked) | r' | > 20.5 |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS (Flewelling et al., 2018)
and not corrected for Galactic extinction.

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
