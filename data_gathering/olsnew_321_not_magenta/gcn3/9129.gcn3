The long GRB 090410 (Swift/BATtrigger #348929 ; Grupe et al.,
GCN 9122) triggered the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM)
 which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 16:57:53.392 UT
(=T0).

The observed light curve shows  main peaks starting at T0-5s, ending
at T0+25s, followed by a long weak tail seen up to T0+150s. And the
precursor activity reported by Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et al., GCN 9123)
is also seen at T0-55s. The total T90 duration including this precursor
is about 166 seconds. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.2 +/- 0.3  x
10^-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-s scaled peak flux measured from T0+5s was 3.0
(-0.3, +0.2)
photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-60s to
T0+150s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.3 (-0.3, +0.3) (chi^2/d.o.f = 4.9/8), and the spectrum of the main
bright peak from T0-5s to T0+25s is well fitted by a power-law with
exponential cutoff model:
 dN/dE ~  E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
 alpha       1.3 +/-0.5, and
 Epeak       304 (-79, +60) keV (chi^2/d.o.f. = 7.9/7).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
