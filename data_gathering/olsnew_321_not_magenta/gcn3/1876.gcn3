Ulysses, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE-FREGATE (H2601) observed this
burst at 58364 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately  50 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
9.7E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl (2000)=170.434, +41.934 degrees, whose radius is
52.468 +/- 0.065 degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as
this event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error
box cannot be obtained for it.
