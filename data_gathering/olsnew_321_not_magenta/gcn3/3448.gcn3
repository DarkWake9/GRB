Derek B. Fox, Dawn Erb, and Naveen Reddy (Caltech) report:

"We have observed the localization region of XRF050522 (Gotz et al.,
GCN 3446) with the Palomar Hale 5.0-m telescope and Wide-Field
Infrared Camera (WIRC), in a 30-minute series of exposures beginning
at 08:21 UT (mean epoch 02:36 after the burst).

We do not detect any bright new sources by comparison to 2MASS and
XDSS images of the region, and therefore estimate a limiting magnitude
for the afterglow of Ks > 17.2 mag at this time."
