report on behalf of the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen) collaboration

We ran independent, offline, forced photometry (Fremling et al. 2016) of
some candidates (Goldstein et al., GCN 25393, Herner et al., GCN 25373,
Soares-Santos et al., GCN 25438, Andreoni et al., GCN 25362) from the Dark
Energy Camera that have a photometric redshift consistent with the GW
constraint for S190814bv (GCN LVC et al., 25324, 25333). The following
candidates are consistent with flat evolution within error bars of
typically 0.15 mag: DG19wgmjc/AT2019npw , DG19wxnjc/AT2019npv,
DG19rzhoc/AT2019num, desgw-190814q/AT2019obc. This photometry is consistent
within the uncertainties with Annis et al., GCN 25458 and Smartt et al. GCN
25455. We caution that previous photometry reported by our discovery
pipeline to TNS esp. on the first two nights was preliminary and affected
by weather.
