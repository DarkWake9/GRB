report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:07:25.03 UT on 16 February 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 200216A (trigger 603536850 / 200216380)
which was also detected via Swift ground analysis (DeLaunay et al. 2020,
GCN 27107)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 68
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright pulse followed by
some extended emission with a duration (T90) of about 8.0 s (10-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-5.0 s to T0+2.5 s is best fit by
a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is 0.9 +/- 0.9 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 180.0 +/- 34.0 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.4 +/- 0.9)E-07 erg/cm^2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0-4.16 s
in the 10-1000 keV band is 0.92 +/- 0.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
