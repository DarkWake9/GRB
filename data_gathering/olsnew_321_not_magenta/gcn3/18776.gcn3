Angelo Antonelli (INAF-OaR), Alessandro Carosi (INAF-OaR), Barbara de Lotto (Univ. Udine), Razmik Mirzoyan (MPI-MÃ¼enchen) and Antonio Stamerra (INAF-OaTo and SNS-Pisa) on behalf of the MAGIC collaboration

The MAGIC system of Cherenkov Telescopes, sensitive to high-energy gamma-ray above ~50 GeV, performed observations of 4 regions in the strip of the bayestar GW map for the trigger G211117.
Observations started on  December 28,  21 UT. Each observation covers a region of ~2.5x2.5 deg. Analysis is on-going.
The list of targets is the following:

Target 1:  PGC1200980 (OT MASTER GCN#18729)
RA,Dec (J2000):  02:09:05.8,  +01:38:03.0
Duration: 42 min

Target 2: strip from GW map
RA,Dec (J2000):  02:38:38.93, +16:36:59.27
Duration: 56 min (moonlight conditions)

Target 3: Field VST (GCN#18734)
RA,Dec (J2000):  02:38:02.208,  +19:13:12.00
Duration: 28 min (moonlight conditions)

Target 4: Field VST (GCN#18734)
RA,Dec (J2000):  03:18:23.712,  +31:13:12.00
Duration: 30 min (moonlight conditions)

MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes located at the Canary island of La Palma, Spain, and designed to
perform gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range from 50 GeV to greater than
50 TeV.
