Dale A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the Swift burst GRB 060123
(GCN 4584; GCN 4608) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2006 January 26.47
and January 30.52 UT. No radio emission was detected within the
refined 3-arcsec XRT error circle (GCN 4600) above a 4-sigma level at
either epoch, with sigma noise values of 26 uJy and 18 uJy, respectively.

No further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
