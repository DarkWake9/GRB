Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170202A (trigger #736407)  (Racusin, et al.,
GCN Circ. 20575). The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 152.526, 5.021 deg
which is RA(J2000) = 10h 10m 06.3s Dec(J2000) = +05d 01' 15.7" with an uncertainty
of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The partial coding was 50%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure.  The first peak
starts at T+0 sec, peaks at T+3 sec and decays to near background by T+15 sec,
at which time the second, larger peak begins.  This structure peaks at T+17 sec,
and the third overlapping peak has a maximum at T+21 sec, and decays to
near background by T+50 sec, with some low-level emission extending out to
T+80 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 46.2 +- 11.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.25 to T+76.46 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.68 +- 0.07. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
3.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+16.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 4.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec. All the
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
