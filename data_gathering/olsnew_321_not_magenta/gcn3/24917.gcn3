J. Wood (NASA) and R. Hamburg (UAH) report on behalf of the
Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 190629A
(GCN 24910), at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the
reported neutrino location at:

RA = 27.22 (Dec value too close to pole for accurate error on RA) J2000
DEC = 84.33 (+4.95/-3.13 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time
of the neutrino candidate. An automated, blind search for gamma
-ray transients below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-
GBM also identified no counterpart candidates +/- 1 hour of event
time.

The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive, coherent search for
GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around the neutrino candidate
time. The most significant result from this search was found T0+12 s
on the longest timescale of ~10 s and was best fit with the "normal"
spectral template described in arXiv:1612.02395. The GBM localization
is centered at RA, DEC = (123.8, 25.0) with a 90% credible region
spanning 10,084 square degrees. Modelling the neutrino localization
as a Gaussian with a width of 3 degrees and centered at the
coordinates reported by IceCube, we find the spatial consistency
between the localizations to be 1.8%. We therefore consider this
signal likely unrelated to IceCube-190629A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates
(arXiv:1612.02395), we report the following 3 sigma flux upper limits
over 10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):
