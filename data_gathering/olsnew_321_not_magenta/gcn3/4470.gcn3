"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB060110 (GCN 4463) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 09:32:57 UT on Jan.10.
After co-adding a set of 13 images (09:32:57 - 09:53:51 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 17.3mag."
