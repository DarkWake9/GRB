SUBJECT: GRB 130627A: Swift-XRT observations

J.A. Kennea (PSU), G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB), S. Campana (INAF-OAB),
P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 130627A at 09:44:39.3 UT,
2975.9 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 184.41689,
-37.08615 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 12h 17m 40.05s
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 05' 10.1"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 80 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (7.95 x
10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 3.9
(+2.51/-2.13) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).
