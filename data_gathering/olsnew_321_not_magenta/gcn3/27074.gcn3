Anna Y. Q. Ho and Andy Tzanidakis (Caltech) report on behalf of the GROWTH
collaboration:

On 2020-02-14 UT we obtained spectroscopy of three of the reported ZTF
optical transients (Kasliwal et al. GCN 27051) inside the error region of
S200213t (LVC,GCN #27042) using the Double Beam Spectrograph on the
200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. We used SNID to make
preliminary classifications.

The spectrum of AT2020cjb/ZTF20aamvnth shows a broad emission feature
consistent with H-alpha at the host redshift of z=0.06, corroborating the
SN II classification reported in Castro-Tirado et al. GCN #27063.

The spectrum of AT2020cjc/ZTF20aamvoeh is a match to a type Ia SN at z~0.14
close to maximum light.

The spectrum of AT2020cja/ZTF20aamvmzj has a blue continuum and a broad
emission feature around 5600AA.

Observations of additional sources are ongoing.
