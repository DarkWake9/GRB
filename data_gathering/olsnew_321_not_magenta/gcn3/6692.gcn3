At 07:07:25 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 070802 (trigger=286809).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 36.851, -55.536 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 27m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 32' 10"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a peak
with a duration of roughly 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 07:09:43 UT, 138 seconds after the BAT
trigger.  The XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a source
in the image, however using 510s of promptly available data we find
an uncatalogued source at Ra, Dec=36.8987, -55.52781 degrees, which is
equivalent to:
  RA(J2000) =  02h 27m 35.69s
  Dec(J2000) = -55d 31' 40.1"

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.4 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). 
This source is 101.6 arcsec from the BAT position, within the
BAT error circle. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 141 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for extinction of E(B-V) = 0.026.

[GCN OPS NOTE(02aug06): Per author's request, the floating point form of the
XRT Dec location was changed from "-55.2781" to "-55.52781".  We thank
Aybuke Kupcu-Yoldas for pointing out our error.  And see GCN 6697 for an refined
XRT position.]
