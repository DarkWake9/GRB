The long GRB 080328 (Swift/BAT trigger #307931 ; Perri et al.,
GCN 7525) was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor
(WAM) which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2008-03-28 
08:03:14 UT (=T0). The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked
structure starting at T0+0s, ending at T0+100 with a duration (T90)
of about 85 seconds. The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was
1.61 (-0.40,+0.37) * 10^-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-s peak flux measured from
T0+0s was 6.4 (-0.39,+0.39) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-0s to
T0+100s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 1.72 (-0.26, +0.38) (chi^2/d.o.f = 11.9/15).
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
