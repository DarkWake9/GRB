TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1738
SUBJECT: GRB021211 - Upper limits from recent and historical observations
DATE:    02/12/12 00:49:08 GMT
FROM:    Michael Wood-Vasey at UC Berkeley/LBNL/SNfactory  <wmwood-vasey@lbl.gov>

W. M. Wood-Vasey, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using images
obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks, and K. Lawrence
(Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory),
reports upper limits for previous observations at the location of the
object identified by Fox et al. (GCN 1731) as the optical counterpart
to GRB 20021211 from unfiltered observations with the 1.2m MSSS
telescope at Haleakala and the Oschin 48" telescope at Palomar
Observatory (the same instrument as used by Fox et al.).

A co-addition of Haleakala images from 5 January, 11 January, 
16 January, 1 December (all dates 2002 UT) shows no source visible at
this location to a limiting unfiltered magnitude of 21.6 (calibrated
to USNO R-band stars on the image frame) at a S/N of 3.

Palomar images from 9 December 2002, taken under non-ideal conditions, 
show no source visible at this location to a limiting unfiltered 
magnitude of 18.4 (calibrated to USNO R-band stars on the image frame) 
at a S/N of 3.

The Haleakala co-added image is available at
