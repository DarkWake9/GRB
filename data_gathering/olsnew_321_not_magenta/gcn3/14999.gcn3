G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 11:43:04.27 UT on 08 July 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130708A (trigger 394976587/130708488)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Cummings et al., GCN Circ. 14997).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 14 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 s to T0 + 8 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.9 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 158 +/- 16 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.3 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.0 +/- 0.07 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
