We imaged the field of GRB 140628A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 602803) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 6.72h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
22 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were poor.

We co-added a series of exposures. We do not
see any optical counterpart at the UVOT position mentioned
by Kuin et al. (GCNC 16472):

t0+6.72h to t0+7.27h : Rlim = 19.9

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
