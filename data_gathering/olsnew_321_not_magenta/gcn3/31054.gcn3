The short-duration GRB 211106A
(Swift/BAT-GUANO localization: Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31049)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=16652.485 s UT (04:37:32.485).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse
started at ~T0-0.3 s with a total duration of ~0.5 s.
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB211106_T16652/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 6.09(-1.22,+1.41)x10^-7 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.070 s,
of 3.37(-1.59,+1.68)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+0.192 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -0.02(-0.80,+1.13)
and Ep = 196(-45,+78) keV (chi2 = 27/23 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.2
(chi2 = 27/22 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
