WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 200701A (Evans al.,
GCN 32306) starting at 04:57:09 UT, 251 s after the burst.
Observations were performed with an automatic sequence in the
clear (roughly R), V, and I filters, and the exposure time was 20 s
per image. Our first few images were out-focused, and the first useful
focused image started at 05:07:57 UT. In the aftward focused images,
we do not detect any optical afterglow candidate within
the reported XRT position error circle (Evans et al., GCN 32306),
neither in single image, nor in the co-add images.
The typical limiting magnitude of our single clear image is about
18.5 mag calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
