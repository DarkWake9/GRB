E. Troja (U. Leicester/INAF-IASFPa) and M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.9 ks of Swift XRT data for GRB 080413B (Stamatikos et
al. GCN Circ. 7598), from T0+134 s to T0+20.1 ks. 
The data set consists of 376 s exposure in Windowed Timing (WT) mode 
followed by 9.5 ks exposure in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

By using orbits 2-4 of PC data [from T0+6.0 ks to T0+20.1 ks]
in order to avoid pile-up effects, we derive an XRT refined position 

     RA (2000) = 21h 44m 34.43s  = 326.1435 d
     Dec (2000) = -19d 58' 52.9" = -19.9814 d

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (90% containment). This position
is 3.6 arcsec from the UVOT candidate afterglow (GCN Circ. 7598), 
and 3.4 arcsec from the source reported in Kruehler et al. (GCN Circ.
7599).

The X-ray light curve is well fitted by a simple power-law, with a 
decay slope of 0.88 +/- 0.06.

A spectrum obtained from the WT mode data, from T0+135 s to T0+511 s,
can be modelled with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 
2.05 +/- 0.10 , and a redshifted absorbing column of (0.32 +/- 0.13) 
x 10^22 cm^-2 at a redshift of z=1.1 (Vreeswijk et al. GCN Circ 7601) 
in addition to the Galactic column of 3.06 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et 
al. 2005). The observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux in this spectrum is
1.79 x 10^-10 (2.13 x 10^-10) erg/cm^2/s. 
The PC spectrum of the first four orbits, from T0+512 s to T0+20.1 ks, 
can be fit by an absorbed power-law model with photon index 1.93 +/-
0.08 and a column density consistent with the WT spectrum. 
All the reported errors are at the 90% confidence level.

If the source continues to decay at the present rate, we predict a count
rate of 0.035 count/sec at T0+24 hours, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV 
observed (unabsorbed) flux of 1.6 x 10^-12 (1.8 x 10^-12) erg/cm^2/s.
