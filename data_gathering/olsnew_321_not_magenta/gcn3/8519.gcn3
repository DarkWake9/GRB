report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:25:43.03 UT on 10 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 081110 (trigger 248019944 / 081110601).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 123.6, DEC = +21.2 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 08h 14 m, 21 d 12'), with an uncertainty
of 1 degree (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67 degrees.

The burst has a duration (T90) of about 20 s (8-1000 keV).
The GBM light curve consists of three pulses, a bright
FRED-like pulse from T0 to T0+5 s, a second weaker
pulse at T0+9 s followed by weaker emission out to about T0+20 s.
This is a hard gamma-ray burst with events detected up
to about 2 MeV. Spectral analysis is on-going.

The final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
