We observed the field of GRB 131030A (Troja, et al., GCN 15402) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/10 31.08 to 2013/10 31.37 UTC (4.91
to 11.97 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.26 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.69 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

We detect the uncatalogued source reported by UVOT (Troja et al., GCN
Circ. 15414). In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the
following detections:

  r     19.14 +/- 0.01
  i     18.92 +/- 0.01
  Z     18.76 +/- 0.02
  Y     18.61 +/- 0.02
  J     18.62 +/- 0.02
  H     18.40 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB. We can confirm that this source
fades during our observations with power-law decay indices of approximately
t^-0.9 in the r, i, Z and Y bands and a shallower decay of t^-0.5 and
t^-0.4 in the J and H bands, respectively.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
