M. Nysewander, L. Johnson, D. Moschler, J. Richuso (U. North Carolina), and
D. Reichart (Caltech) report:

We observed the entire ~19 square arcminute error box of the ~1.5 second
duration GRB 020603 (GCN 1409, 1412) with the 0.6 meter Morehead Observatory
telescope beginning 2.36 days after the burst.  We integrated without filter
for ~2800 seconds per pointing x 2 pointings through scattered cirrus and
relatively high airmass.

Visual comparison with the DSS reveals no transients down to our limiting
magnitude, which we estimate to be V ~ 18.5 mag.
