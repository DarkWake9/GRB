K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, C. Guidorzi, E. Montanari,
and F. Frontera, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, and T. Cline,
on behalf of the NEAR GRB team, report:

Ulysses, BeppoSAX GRBM, and NEAR observed this burst at 53479 s UT.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approx. 7 s, a 25 - 100 keV
fluence of approx.  1E-5 erg/cm2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of approx.
2E-6 erg/cm2 s.  Due to an unfavorable arrival direction, it can only
be localized to an approx. 6 degree by 20 arcmin. error box whose
coordinates are:
  
    RA(2000)	     DEC(2000)
16 h 00 m 21 s	    -56 o 48 ' 39 "  (CENTER)
15 h 50 m 26 s      -54 o 00 ' 00 "  (CORNER)
15 h 53 m 11 s      -54 o 00 ' 00 "  (CORNER)
16 h 10 m 21 s      -59 o 22 ' 42 "  (CORNER)
16 h 09 m 02 s      -59 o 22 ' 42 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be improved somewhat.
