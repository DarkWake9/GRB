While performing follow-up of GRB 200405B (GCN 27497, 27516) we received
notification of the detection of GRB 200409A and the associated optical
and X-ray candidate counterpart (GCN 27509). We added it to our schedule
and carried out observations of it from 2020-04-09 07:00-09:30 UTC,
approximately 5 hours post-burst.

We make no detection of radio emission at 5.5 or 9 GHz with 3-sigma upper
limits of 90 uJy and 81 uJy respectively.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations during these
especially difficult times.
