N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and K. L. Page (U. Leicester)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Source reported in our previous GCN Circ. No 22831 is
in fact a source present in the DSS survey. The extinction
of this bursts is very high, so there is no afterglow seen.
Our apologies for this error.
