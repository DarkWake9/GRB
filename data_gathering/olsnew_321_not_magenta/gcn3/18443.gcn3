A. Klotz, M. Boer, D. Coward, N. Seghouani, J.P. Rivet, on behalf of the 
TZAC collaboration (TAROT-Zadko-Aures-C2PU) collaboration report:

Following GCN #18442 on the possible GW event G194575, the TAROT 
instruments located at the Calern Observatory (OCA - France) and La 
Silla Observatory (ESO - Chile) have started observations of the error 
box given in the above mentioned GCN.

The main probability island is located too close to the Sun, but the 
other one is perfectly observable.
We are observing currently with TAROT Calern, then, as soon as possible 
in Chile, the 5 following regions of 1.9° x 1.9° centred on:

RA= 9.5 Dec=2.6 J2000
RA=18.5 Dec=5.5 J2000
RA=19.5 Dec=3.6 J2000
RA=20.5 Dec=5.3 J2000
RA=21.0 Dec=1.8 J2000

We will report later on the observations and results.
