on behalf of the Swift team report:

Swift trigger 538575 was due to a noise fluctuation in the image domain
near (8 arcmin) the catalog source NGC7462.  This 8 arcmin distance,
a low image significance (6.13 sigma), and the lack of an XRT source
strongly indicates that this trigger is non-astrophysical.
