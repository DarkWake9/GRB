Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 3.3 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode XRT data for the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 151205B (Marshall et al. GCN Circ. 18659),
collected between T0+3.1 ks and T0+68.9 ks. 

The first set of observations consists of 1.0 ks of data collected 
between T0+3.1 ks and T0+5.7 ks. 
No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field is 7.7e-3 ct  s^-1,
corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 2.7e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The second set of observations consists of 2.3 ks data collected 
between T0+39.8 ks and T0+68.9 ks. 
No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field is 3.7e-3 ct  s^-1,
corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 1.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).
