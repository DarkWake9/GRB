P.A. Evans, K.L. Page and A. Amaral-Rogers (U. Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.8 ks of XRT data for the IPN-detected burst: GRB
140611A, from 80.5 ks to 92.1 ks after the IPN trigger (Golenetskii et
al., GCN Circ. 16384). The burst was also detected in ground analysis
of BAT data (Cummings, GCN Circ. 16386). The data are entirely in
Photon Counting (PC) mode.  An X-ray source is detected within the IPN
and BAT error regions. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 349.9173,
-40.1044 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 23 19 40.15
Dec(J2000): -40 06 16.0

with an uncertainty of 5.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 64 arcsec from the BAT ground position and 106 arcsec from
the centre of the IPN error box. The source has a mean count rate of
(1.9 +0.9,-0.7) x 10^-3 count s^-1 over this time interval. Within the
4-arcmin radius BAT error circle, we would expect approximately 0.25
serendipitous sources of at least this brightness. We cannot determine
whether the source is fading and no further observations are planned.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
