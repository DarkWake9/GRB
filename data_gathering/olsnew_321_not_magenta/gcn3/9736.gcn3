Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090728 (trigger #358574)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 9725).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 29.644, 41.632 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 58m 34.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 37' 53.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single pulse starting at ~T-10 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+70 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
59 +- 18 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.0 to T+63.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.05 +- 0.26.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.25 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
