report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

The robotic 60-cm REM telescope, located at La Silla (Chile), observed 
automatically the field of GRB 060908 (Evans et al., GCN 5544) with 
ROSS optical camera. Observations started at 09:06:21 UT, about 7 min 
after the burst,  in R, I and V band.

An uncatalogued fading source was observed in all filters at:

RA: 02:07:18.3
DEC +00:20:31

This position is consistent with the one reported in GCN 5544 and GCN 
5545.

In the R initial image the source is at approximately R ~ 17 in 20 sec 
exposure time.

Further analysis is in progress.
