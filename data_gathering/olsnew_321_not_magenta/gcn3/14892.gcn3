report:

The bright, long GRB 130606B (Fermi-LAT detection: G. Vianello, et al .
14795) triggered the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at  UT 11:55:35.360(=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starting at
T0-3.5 s, ending at T0+63 s with a duration (T90) of about 43.7 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.33 (-0.73, +0.02) *10^-4 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+11.5 s was
20.64 (-4.72, +0.51) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-3 s to
T0+63 s is well fitted by a GRB Band model as follows.
the low-energy photon index alpha: -1.24 (-0.31, +0.79),
the high-energy photon index beta: -2.08 (-0.16, +0.11),
and the peak energy Epeak: 619 (-251, +396) keV,
(chi^2/d.o.f = 17.1/13).

Due to the brightness of this burst, a 3% systematic error was added for
low energy channels.
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
