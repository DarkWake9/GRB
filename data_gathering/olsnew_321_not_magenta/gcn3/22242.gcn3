I.A. Smith (Rice U.) and N.R. Tanvir (U. of Leicester) report:

We are monitoring GRB 171205A (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 22177)
using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James 
Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The source is well detected, as seen 
at longer wavelengths by NOEMA (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 
Circ. 22187) and the VLA (Laskar et al., GCN Circ. 22216).
At 3.4 days after the burst trigger, the 850 micron flux density
was 30.3 +/- 2.4 mJy/beam.

We thank Mark Rawlings, William Montgomerie, Giovanni Rosotti,
Jim Hoge, and the JCMT staff for the prompt support of these 
observations that are being taken under project S17BP006.
