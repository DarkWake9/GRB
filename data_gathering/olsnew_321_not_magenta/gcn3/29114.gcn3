The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:28:47 UT on 21 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201221E (trigger 630286132.63327 / 201221978).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 158.1, Dec = -39.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 32m, -39d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.0 degrees.
