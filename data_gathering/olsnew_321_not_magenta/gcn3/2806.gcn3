" We have observed the entire INTEGRAL error circle of GRB041015
(S. Mereghetti et al., GCN 2805) with the Kiso observatory 1.05
Schmidt telescope started at 13:40 UT (0.10255 days after the burst).
We obtained six R-band images with 300 sec exposure. The upper limit
is about R~21 mag. estimated from several USNO-B1.0
catalogue. Comparison with DSS II red image, we can not find new
objects brighter than the limit of DSS image."
