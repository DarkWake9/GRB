C. Kouveliotou (NASA/MSFC) and M.S. Briggs (UAHuntsville) report on
behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 20:14:42.77 UT on 02 November 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and
located a very soft and bright event (trigger 247349683 / 081102844).
The event location was RA = 217.6 deg, dec = -15.7 deg (+/- 1.1 deg), in
excellent agreement with the Sun location. The time of the event
coincides with the solar activity reported in the GOES solar reports
(event 9790: onset at 2012 UT, max at 2015 UT, end at 2017, B5.7 flare).
This is the first GBM detection of a solar flare; future detections will
not be reported in a GCN Circular, unless they exhibit special
characteristics. 

The GBM light curve shows a multiple peak event lasting approximately
177 s (8-30 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-13.824 s to
T0+163.33 s is best fit by a single power law model with index -6.55 +/-
0.03 (chi squared 255 for 120 d.o.f.). The event fluence (8-30 keV) in
this time interval is (1.54 +/- 0.03) E-4 erg/cm^2. 

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary.
