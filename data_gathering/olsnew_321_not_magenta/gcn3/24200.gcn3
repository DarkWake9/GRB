Pavana M., G. C. Anupama, B. S. Kiran (IIA) and V. Bhalerao (IITB) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the potential counterpart ZTF19aarykkb (Kasliwal et al., GCN 24191) to the GW candidate S190525z (GCN 24168) with the HFOSC instrument on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope. We obtained 2x30min exposures in the g7 grism and 1x30min exposure in the g8 grism. Spectra were reduced following standard techniques in IRAF.

The spectra show a broad, relatively featureless, continuum. We see emission features corresponding to H alpha and He II (4686) at the host redshift of 0.024. At this time, host contamination cannot be ruled out. The He II feature, if confirmed, indicates a very hot source. Further spectroscopic follow-up observations are encouraged.
