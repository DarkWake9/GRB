K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.9 ks of XRT data for the candidate afterglow iPTF 13dsw
(Kasliwal, Singer & Cenko, GCN Circ. 15324; Xu et al., GCN Circ. 15325;
GCN Circ. 15326; Perley, Cenko & Kasliwal, GCN Circ. 15327; Sudilovsky,
Tanga, & Greiner, GCN Circ. 15328), obtained on October 12, between 17:06
and 20:54 (starting approximately 24 hours after Fermi Trigger 403206457).
A faint X-ray source consistent with the iPTF 13dsw position is detected:
RA, Dec = 32.5255, -4.4117, which is equivalent to

RA(J2000)  =  02h 10m 06.11s
Dec(J2000) = -04d 24' 42.1"

with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). Currently the
source has a 0.3-10 keV count rate in the Swift-XRT of (5.9 +0.9/-0.8)e-3
count s^-1. We cannot determine at the present time whether the source is
fading.

Given the small number of detected X-ray photons, any spectral analysis is
uncertain. However, the spectrum can be suitably approximated by a
power-law with Gamma = 1.5 +0.6/-0.7, absorbed by the Galactic NH in this
direction of 1.85e20 cm^-2. The observed (unabsorbed) flux is 2.9e-13
(3.0e-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
