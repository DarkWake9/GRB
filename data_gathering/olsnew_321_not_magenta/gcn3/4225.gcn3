on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team report:
  
The automated 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observations of the error
region of GRB051109B (Swift trigger 163170) at 08:40:35.3 UT, 56 seconds
after the burst. We obtained a series of images in the R filter.
The field was at high airmass (at least secz=2.36), with thin clouds.
  
The source reported by the SWIFT/UVOT (Tagliaferri et al., GCN4222)
is not apparent in the first 10 second image (limiting magnitude ~ 17.0),
nor in subsequent co-added images. Further analysis of the complete
observing sequence is on-going.
