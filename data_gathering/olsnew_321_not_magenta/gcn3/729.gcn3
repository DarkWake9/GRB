 collaboration report:
 
 On June 20.86 U.T. and on June 21.83 U.T. we imaged the BeppoSAX
 error-box of GRB000620 (GCN #718) using the AZT-24 1.1-meter
 telescope at Campo Imperatore (AQ). We obtained two mosaics of J-band
 images for a total exposure time of 1500 s in each mosaic.
 The limiting mag reached in the 2'.6x2'.6 central part of both mosaics
 is J=20.5 mag down to J=19.5 mag on the border and seeing has been
 around 2.5 arcsec during both observations.
 
 A comparison of the two observations does not reveal any new or variable
 object within the BeppoSAX+IPN error box (GCNs #718, #723).
