Eric Burns (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:11:21.10 UT on 07 December 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 141207A (trigger 439672284 / 141207800) which
was also detected by Fermi LAT (Arimoto et al. 2014, GCN 17146) and
observed by Swift (Evans 2014, GCN 17147). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the LAT/Swift positions.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with multiple spikes,
with a duration (T90) of about 20 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-0.768 s to T0+24.83 s is adequately fit by a power law
function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is
-0.70 +/- 0.02 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is
1080 +/- 56 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.58 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.55 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 8.6 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
