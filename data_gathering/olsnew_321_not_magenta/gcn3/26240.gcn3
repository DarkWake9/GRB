triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 21:23:31.261 UTC
on 31 October 2019. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
No real-time CGBM GCN notice was distributed about this trigger because
the real-time communication from the ISS was off (loss of signal).

The burst light curve shows a multi-peak structure which starts at T-0.168
sec, peaks at 0.008 sec and ends at T+0.192 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 0.240 +- 0.079 sec and 0.104 +- 0.008 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
