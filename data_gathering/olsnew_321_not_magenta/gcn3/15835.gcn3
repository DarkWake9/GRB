and S. Gezari (UMD) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We observed the field of GRB140206A (Swift trigger 585834, Lien et al., GCN
15784) with the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the recently commissioned
4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) at Happy Jack, AZ from 2014/02/13
5:33 to 2014/02/13 6:03 UTC (mean epoch of 6.9 d after the Swift trigger).


A source is clearly detected at the location of the optical afterglow
(Oksanen et al, GCN 15786).  Using nearby point sources from SDSS for
calibration, we measure r' = 21.69 +/- 0.07 (AB).  This value is not
corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.


We thank the staff of the Discovery Channel Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
