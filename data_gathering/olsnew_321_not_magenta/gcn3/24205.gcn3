D.A.H. Buckley (SAAO), S. W. Jha (Rutgers), J. Cooke (Swinburne), and M.
Mogotsi (SALT/SAAO) report on behalf of the SALT GW collaboration:

We obtained an 1600-sec spectrum of ZTF19aarzaod (=AT 2019dzw; Kasliwal et al.
2019, GCN 24191) with SALT (+RSS) using the PG0300 line grating. The target is
well detected with a red continuum and a broad (~8000 km/s FWHM) H-alpha
emission feature at the redshift of the host galaxy, z=0.028. The data are
consistent with ZTF19aarzaod being a type II supernova, with the red color
likely a result of the heavy Milky Way extinction A_V = 2.2 (Schlafly &
Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ, 737, 103).
