The long bright GRB 210514A (Swift detection: Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ.
30008, Lien and Ambrosi, GCN Circ. 30009, Markwardt et al., GCN Circ.
30018; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/210514A.gcn3) triggered the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 18:23:42.591 UTC on 14 May 2021
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1305051705/index.html).
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows several partially overlapped pulses which
start at T+3.3 sec, peak at T+4.9 sec, and end at T+53.8 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 46.0 +- 2.5 sec
and 25.9 +- 3.3 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
