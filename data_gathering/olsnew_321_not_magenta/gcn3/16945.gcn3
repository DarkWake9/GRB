M. Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:04:40.21 UT on 22 October 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 141022B (trigger 435636283 / 141022087).

The trigger resulted in an Autonomous Repoint Request (ARR)
that was accepted and the spacecraft slewed to the GBM in-flight location.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 119.4, DEC = -75.2 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 7h 58m, -75d 12'), with an uncertainty
of 1.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single episode consisting of
several pulses with a duration (T90) of about 9.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+1.9 s to T0+12.2 s is well
fit by a Band function with Epeak = 368.1 (+/-11.2) keV,
alpha = -0.64 +/- 0.02 , and beta = -2.41 (+/-0.05).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.87 +/- 0.07)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+3.328 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 62.9 +/- 1.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
