E. Rol (Leicester), A. Levan (Warwick), N. Tanvir (Leicester), M.
Schirmer (ING), A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC Granada), on behalf of 
a larger collaboration, report:

"We observed the location of GRB 070306 (Pandey et al. GCNC 6169) using 
the 4.2m WHT (+LIRIS) in the JHK bands beginning at 19:57 UT, roughly 
3.27 hours after the burst. Within the X-ray localisation of Page et al. 
(GCNC 6172) we find a single source, which is also present in the SDSS 
pre-observations of the field (Cool et al. GCNC 6170). The location of 
this source is

RA:  09:52:23.31 (J2000)
DEC: +10:28:55.26 (J2000)

with errors of 0.3" in each coordinate.

Preliminary photometry implies K=17.9 +/- 0.1. Compared to the measured SDSS 
magnitudes this implies r-K~5. This is unusually red for a GRB host
galaxy and may indicate a contribution from the IR afterglow. Further
observations will be necessary to ascertain any variability."
