on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the field of GRB 140606B twice after
its return to normal operations for a total of 9 ks exposure.
We confirm that the light curve of the X-ray source given
in Mangano et al. (GCN Circ. 16366 and 16373) shows a
power-law decay with slope 1.0 (+0.7,-0.6).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
