D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 02:53:09 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located SGR 1900+14 (trigger=203127).  Swift was already following up
this source when this new outburst occurred.  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is RA,Dec 286.804, +9.330 {19h 07m 13s, +09d 19' 48"}
(J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve has multiple peaks. 
There are at least 8 peaks in the first 25 sec.  There are about 4 more
smaller peaks in the next 10 sec, and a peak at T+135 sec.  The
peak count rate was ~350,000 counts/sec (15-100 keV), at ~21 sec after
the trigger.  We note this is ~3 times brighter than the single-peak
outburst detected on the previous orbit.
