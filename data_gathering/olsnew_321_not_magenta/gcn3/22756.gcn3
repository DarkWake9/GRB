J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore
(U. Leicester), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P.
D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), S. J. LaPorte (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), B.
Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and S.B. Cenko report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 180602A (Cenko et al. GCN
Circ. 22752), from 130 s to 59.7 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 85 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 22753).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.6 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.38 (+0.16, -0.13).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 2.36 (+0.28, -0.25). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.0 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.04 (+0.16, -0.15)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 4.2 (+0.8, -0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.8 x 10^-11 (6.2 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     4.2 (+0.8, -0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 9.1 sigma
Photon index:	     2.04 (+0.16, -0.15)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.38, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 7.3 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.8 x
10^-13 (4.5 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
