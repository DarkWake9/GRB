We just find that the GRB name (GRB 170921A) used in our pervious
GCN circular (Zhang et al. GCN 21919) is wrong. The correct GRB name
is GRB 170921C since GRB 170921A and GRB 170921B were already named
for the GRBs detected respectively by Swift/BAT on 14:28:48 UT 
(D'Ai et al. GCN 21901) and Fermi/GBM on 04:02:11.51 UT
(Bissaldi et al. GCN 21902). Apologies for any confusion caused.
