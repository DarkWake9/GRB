We observed the field of GRB 160127A (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 18938)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/01 27.39 to
2016/01 27.55 UTC (0.73 to 4.43 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 2.68 hours exposure in the r,i and z bands.

We detect the optical counterpart at

RA, Dec = 15:3:55.77, +00:04:22.4 (J2000, +/-0.5”).

In comparison with the SDSS DR9, we obtain the following magnitudes:

 r	20.64 +/- 0.03
 i	20.66 +/- 0.03
 z	20.14 +/- 0.32

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Further observations are planned.

Mártir.
