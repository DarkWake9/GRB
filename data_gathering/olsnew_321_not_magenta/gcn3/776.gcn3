K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the
Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, report:

This burst was observed by Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR at 31075 s.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration ~30 s, a 25-100 keV fluence
~4x10^-5 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux over 0.5 s of 2.7 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
area is ~200 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:


    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  8 h 57 m 20.46 s     -8 o 49 '  12.10 "  (CENTER)
  8 h 57 m 54.47 s     -8 o 44 '   9.72 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 55 m 11.33 s     -8 o 57 '  53.17 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 59 m 22.50 s     -8 o 41 '  35.49 "  (CORNER)
  8 h 56 m 45.97 s     -8 o 54 '  19.51 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be refined considerably.
