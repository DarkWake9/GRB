and A. Goldstein, on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 171108A (Hamburg and Meegan, GCN Circ. 22112) was 
detected by Fermi (GBM trigger 531848691), Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT) 
at about 56686 s UT (15:44:46).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
  ---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   109.952 (07h 19m 48s) +29.091 (+29d 05' 28")
  Corners:
   112.518 (07h 30m 04s) +45.785 (+45d 47' 05")
   107.816 (07h 11m 16s) +12.385 (+12d 23' 05")
   107.666 (07h 10m 40s) +12.387 (+12d 23' 12")
   112.309 (07h 29m 14s) +45.789 (+45d 47' 21")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 4.9 sq. deg, and its maximum
dimension is 33.6 deg (the minimum one is 8.8 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 116 deg.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given a forthcoming GCN 
Circular.
