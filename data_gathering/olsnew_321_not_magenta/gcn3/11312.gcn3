Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100928A (trigger #435160)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 11310).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 223.037, -28.542 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  14h 52m 09.0s
    Dec(J2000) = -28d 32' 32.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 15%.

The mask-weighted light curve showed a single peak starting at T-1 with a total
duration of ~6 seconds. T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.3 +- 0.6 sec (estimated error 
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.9 to T+4.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.79 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.6 x 10-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.31 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.5 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
