S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), E.Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, 
L.Ducci (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 30 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 10:37:30 UT of 2015 September 12.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 248.4435 deg
DEC.= -21.03376  deg

with an uncertainty of   2  arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 1.5 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s 
integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 1e-6 
erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
