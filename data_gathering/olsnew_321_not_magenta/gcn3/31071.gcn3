During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered on-ground by a weak burst, 
GRB 211107A, at 2021-11-07T20:20:40.220 UTC (denoted as T0),
which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #31052). 

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 20-500 keV, 
this burst mainly consists of multiple pulses with a duration of 5 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM location is consistent with the Fermi/GBM position within the error.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
