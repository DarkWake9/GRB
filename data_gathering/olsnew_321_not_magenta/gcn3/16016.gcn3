K.L. Page, C. Pagani, P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) & J.K. Cannizzo
(NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have now analysed 9.8 ks of Swift-XRT data for GRB 140320A, between 93
s and 33.5 ks after the trigger. The X-ray source given by Page, Pagani &
Cannizzo in GCN Circ. 16010 has now faded, with a 3-sigma upper limit on
the count rate centred at 27 ks after the trigger of 1.2 x 10^-3 count
s^-1. We therefore confirm this source as the X-ray afterglow of GRB
140320A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
