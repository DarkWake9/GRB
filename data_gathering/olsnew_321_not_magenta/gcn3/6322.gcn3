S. B. Cenko, S. Gezari, T. Small (Caltech), D. B. Fox (Penn State), and E.
Berger (Carnegie) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have obtained a spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB070419A
(Chornock et al., GCN 6304) with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
mounted on the 10-m Keck I telescope.  Observations consisted of 2 x 900 s
spectra taken at a mean epoch of approximately 11:36 19 April UT (~ 1.62
hr after the burst).

We identify a single strong absorption system, including Mg II, Fe II, Mn
II, and Fe I features, at a preliminary redshift of z = 0.97.  Coupled
with the lack of Lyman-alpha absorption down to ~ 3500 A, we consider
this system is likely from the host galaxy of GRB070419A.
