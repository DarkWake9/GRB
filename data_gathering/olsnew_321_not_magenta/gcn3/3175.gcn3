TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3175
SUBJECT: GRB 050401 Optical Observations 
DATE:    05/04/03 08:33:13 GMT
FROM:    Kuntal Mishra at ARIES,Nainital,India  <kuntal@upso.ernet.in>

Kuntal Misra ((ARIES Naini Tal), Atish P. Kamble (Raman Reserach 
Institute, Bangalore) and S. B. Pandey (ARIES Naini Tal), on behalf of 
larger Indian GRB collaboration

The Swift GRB 050401 (trigger = 113120) was monitored from 1.04-m
reflector at ARIES, Naini Tal in V, R and I bands. The OT candidate
reported by McNaught and Price (GCN 3163), seen in our R band
(900 sec exp) frame taken on April 01.8359 UT was at 21.5 +/- 0.2 mag.

Using this magnitude of the optical afterglow and those reported in
GCN 3163 and GCN 3171, we derive a flux temporal decay index of ~ 1.0,
consistent to D'Avanzo et al. 2005 (GCN 3171).
