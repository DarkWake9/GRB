report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:03:07.03 UT on 15 October 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 161015A (trigger 498243791 / 161015710),
which was also detected by the Fermi-LAT
(Masanori Ohno et al. 2016, GCN 20054)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Fermi-LAT position.

The GBM light curve consists of 3 episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 15 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.003 s to T0+16.384 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 151 +/- 9 keV,
alpha = -0.82 +/- 0.05, and beta = -2.32 +/- 0.11.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.17 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+2.24 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 10.58 +/- 0.30 ph/s/cm^2.

A power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 183 +/- 7 keV, alpha = -0.93 +/- 0.03.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
