K. S. Kawabata, M. Sasada, M. Uemura, T. Yamashita and T. Ohsugi
(Hiroshima Univ.) and R. G. Lundock (Tohoku Univ.) report on behalf
of KANATA/TRISPEC observation team:

  We performed a series of simultaneous optical(Rc) and NIR (J, Ks)
imaging observations for the optical counterpart associated with
GRB 080506 (Baumgartner et al, GCN 7685) using TRISPEC attached to 
the 1.5-m KANATA telescope. Our quick-look analysis showed that Rc
magnitude of the counterpart was 17.5 at 220 sec after the BAT
trigger. It then faded and reached 19.5 at ~5050 sec. We used USNO
A2.0 1275-16800533 (R=15.1) and 1275-16801542 (R=15.1) stars for
comparison. Further analysis is ongoing.
