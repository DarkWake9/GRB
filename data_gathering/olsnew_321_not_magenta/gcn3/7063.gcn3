J. Wang, Y. Urata and W.K. Zheng on behalf of EAFON report:

We have imaged the field of GRB071112C (M. Perri et al 
GCN7059 ) using the TNT 0.8 telescope and EST 1.0 telescope at Xinglong 
observatory.A series of white-band ,R-band and V-band images were obtained 
from 18:34:51, 113s after the burst. In our 20*20s white-band combined image,  
we detected afterglow  as reported (M. Perri et al  GCN 7059,  F. Yuan 
GDN7061).

The estimated brightness derived from USNO-B1.0 R2mag was R2=17.62+/-0.06 at 
38.8s after the burst(mean time of the stacked image).

Further observations are going.
