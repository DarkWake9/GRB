and the CALET collaboration:

The short-duration GRB 160927A (Gibson et al., GCN Circ. 19952) was
detected by the ground analysis of the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) data at 18:04:49.88 on 27 September 2016.  The highest signal-to-noise
based on the light curve data is 5.3 sigma.  The burst signal was seen
by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak starting at T0, peaking
at T+0.4 sec and ending at T+0.6 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 0.35 +- 0.11 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
