D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 48785 seconds.
It had a duration of approximately 60 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  7.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
5.0E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 1.348, -35.197 degrees, whose radius is 22.531 +/-  1.488
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
