FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <klp5@leicester.ac.uk>

K.L. Page and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift
team:

Swift performed a further observation of the field of the BAT and
Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 170710B (Palmer & Lien, GCN Circ. 21316;
Hamburg, Meegan & Bissaldi, GCN Circ. 21319) on 2017 July 15. The
XRT-detected "Source 1", as given in Page et al. (GCN Circ. 21318), shows
no sign of fading, with a count rate of (5.6 +1.9/-1.5)x10^-3 count s^-1
compared to (6.4 +/- 1.5)x10^-3 count s^-1 from the first observation on
July 11. This is therefore not the GRB afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
