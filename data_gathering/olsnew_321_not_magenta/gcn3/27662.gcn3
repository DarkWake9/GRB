report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:




Since 18:26:20.16 UT on 27 April 2020, Multiple SGR-like bursts have 

been observed by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM from magnetar SGR 1935+2154

(Barthelmy et al. 2020,GCN 27657 and Fletcher et al. 2020, GCN 27659).

And more bursts are coming in (Palmer et al. 2020, GCN 27660). 




Insight-HXMT is going to continuously observe SGR 1935+2154 for 60 ks

from 2020-04-28 UTC 07:14:52 to 2020-04-29 UTC 11:53:01, with all its

three sets of collimated detectors covering 1-15 keV, 5-30 keV and 

20-250 keV, respectively. The net observing time intervals (in UT) 

without the Earth blockage of SGR 1935+2154 are as following:

SGR 1935+2154 went into outbursts in 2014 July, 2015 Feb., 2016 May 

and June (Lin et al. 2020). Several short bursts including very 

bright ones were detected in 2019 November and 2020 April by multi 

instruments. The source is now in a very active episode. 




We encourage multi-waveband follow up observations from both ground 

and space, especially the observations overlapping with Insight-HXMT. 




Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 

funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 

the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
