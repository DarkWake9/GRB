Shaunak Modak, Sergiy Vasylyev, Thomas de Jaeger, Keto D. Zhang,
WeiKang Zheng, Andrew Hoffman, Benjamin E. Stahl, Yukei Murakami,
and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of
the Lick/KAIT GW follow-up team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, observed the 90% region of the gravitational-wave
event S190828l (GCN 25503) detected by LIGO/Virgo. More than one
thousand galaxies were selected from the Glade catalog V1.0
(Dalya et al., 2018, MNRAS, 479, 2374; http://aquarius.elte.hu/glade/)
according to their priority score. KAIT observed 59 of them based on
their priority scores and elevation visibility, with each clear-filter
exposure time being 60 s. The first image was taken at 11:44:07, Aug.
29th UT, about 28.8 hours after the trigger, and the last image at
12:57:58 UT. Our typical limiting mag is 18.5. No viable counterparts
were identified and the analysis is ongoing. A full list of galaxies
observed by KAIT is given below.
