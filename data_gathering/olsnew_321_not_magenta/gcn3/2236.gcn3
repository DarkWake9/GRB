GRB 030418: Second Epoch Optical Observations with Magellan

report:

On 2003 April 25.00 UT, we observed the optical afterglow (Price et 
al; GCN2148) of the HETE-localized GRB 030418 (Shirasaki et al; 
GCN2210) with the Magellan 6.5 meter Clay telescope at Las Campanas 
Observatory in Chile.  Our observations consisted of two 400s R-Band 
images, one 400s I-Band image, and one 400s V-Band image taken with 
the MagIC instrument.

The afterglow declined in brightness with respect to our previous 
measurements (Dullighan et al; GCN2168). The R band data is 
consistent with a revised power law decay index = 1.2 +/- 0.1, when 
the two data points from Price et al. (GCN2148 and GCN2150) are 
included.  The afterglow was still point-like, but very close to the 
limiting magnitudes of the images.  No evidence of a host galaxy is 
observed.  We can, however, place a limit on the redshift of the 
afterglow of z<~5, due to the small V-R color difference we observe 
(i.e., no evidence for a Lyman alpha break). Our second epoch results 
were as follows:

UT               t-t0 (days)   Mag
2003-04-25.00    6.58          R=24.9 +/- 0.4
2003-04-25.01    6.59          I>24 (limiting magnitude)
2003-04-25.02    6.60          V=25.1 +/- 0.5

The magnitudes reported above are referenced to the photometry 
reported by A. Henden (GCN2216).  We have also recalibrated the 
magnitudes we reported in GCN 2168 to A. Henden's photometry 
(GCN2216).  The errors in calculating relative magnitudes have now 
been taken into account. Our revised first epoch results are as 
follows:

UT               t-t0 (days)   Mag (Original)     Mag (Revised)
2003-04-21.02    2.60          R=23.64 +/- 0.07   R=23.3 +/- 0.1
2003-04-21.03    2.61          I=22.60 +/- 0.05   I=23.0 +/- 0.1
