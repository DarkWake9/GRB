(DARK/NBI)  D. Xu (WIS & DARK/NBI) report for a larger collaboration:

"We observed the localization of GRB 100206A (Krimm et al. GCN 10376)
with the WHT beginning at 20:33 UT, approximately 7 hours after the
burst. Observations were obtained in the i and z bands with exposures
of 2000 and 2400s respectively.

Inside the refined XRT error circle (Goad et al. GCN 10378), we
detect a faint source in both the i and z-bands.  The location of
the source is:

RA(J2000) = 03:08:38.99
DEC(J2000) = 13:09:22.7

With an uncertainty of approximately 0.5" in each axis. We consider
this to be a candidate afterglow of GRB 100206A, however cannot
currently place any constraints on variability of the source.

Further observations are planned."
