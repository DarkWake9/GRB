At 12:51:39.26 on November 2, 2014, Fermi-LAT detected faint high-energy
emission from the short GRB 141102A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM
(Zhang et al., GCN 17021) and Swift/BAT (Cummings et al., GCN 17020)
and initiated an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.  The high-energy emission
was detected during the ~300 s interval following the GBM trigger.

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

(RA, Dec.) = 208.6, -47.7 deg

with an error radius of 0.6 deg (90% containment, statistical error
only), which is compatible
with the position measured by Swift/BAT (Cummings et al., GCN 17020).

Further follow up is encouraged.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Makoto Arimoto (arimoto@hp.phys.titech.ac.jp).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
