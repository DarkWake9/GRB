FROM:    Erik Katsavounidis at MIT  <kats@ligo.mit.edu>

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

The trigger S200116ah is no longer considered to be a candidate of

interest. The candidate is attributed to non-stationary noise in the L1

detector and is not significant without the contribution from L1.
