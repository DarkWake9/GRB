M. Wieringa and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Beginning at 2004 Jan. 10 14:15 UT we carried out an observation at a
frequency of 8.6 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
centered on the bright XMM X-ray source (GCN# 2508,2512) within the
INTEGRAL error circle (GCN#2505). A 160 uJy radio source was detected
with 5-sigma significance 1.8 arcsec from center of the XMM error
circle at (epoch J2000), R.A.=11:52:13.16, Dec.=-46:47:11.3, with an
uncertainty of +/-0.5 arcsec. This radio source is not coincident with
any of the optical sources reported earlier (GCN#'s 2509,2511,2514 and
2515).

Further observations are planned."
