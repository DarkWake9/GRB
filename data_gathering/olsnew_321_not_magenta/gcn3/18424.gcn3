project

On Oct 16, 2015, starting at 03.41 (UTC), we observed a large fraction
of the localization error range at declinations larger than 0 degrees of
the Advanced LIGO trigger G184098 with the ILT (International
Low-Frequency Array [LOFAR] Telescope). The observations were obtained
with the High-Band Antennas (HBA) at a centre frequency of 145 MHz
(bandwidth 11.9 MHz). In this configuration, the ILT can provide 8
simultaneous beams on the sky, where each beam has a field of view of
approximately 12 deg^2 (beam FWHM 3.9 degrees). The beam centres are
given below:

1) 132.500000 5.166667 08:50:00.00 +05:10:00.0
2) 135.287125 5.166667 09:01:08.91 +05:10:00.0
3) 129.712875 5.166667 08:38:51.09 +05:10:00.0
4) 131.106458 7.572944 08:44:25.55 +07:34:22.6
5) 131.106458 2.760389 08:44:25.55 +02:45:37.4
6) 133.893542 7.572944 08:55:34.45 +07:34:22.6
7) 133.893542 2.760389 08:55:34.45 +02:45:37.4
8) 128.319333 2.760389 08:33:16.64 +02:45:37.4

The observations cover roughly 50 square degrees in total.  Each field
was observed for a total of 3.7 hr with 10s time resolution after
pre-processing.  

This is the second set of observations of these fields, after our initial
run on Sept 21, 2015 (GCN 18364). The fields will be revisited once
more with the same exposures, on a provisional time-scale of 2
months from now. Analysis is ongoing.
