We observed the field of GRB 131128A detected by Swift (trigger #579683; 
Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 15533) with the 12-inch AGU Robotic Optical 
Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N) located at the Sagamihara 
campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.  

60 images of 10 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from 
November 28 15:12:47 (UT) about 383 sec after the trigger 
(77 sec after the BAT position notice) and stopped on November 28 15:30:30 (UT).  
We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual images and 
the stacked image inside the enhanced XRT position (Evans, et al., GCN #15538).  
The estimated five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of  600 sec) 
is ~16.2 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
