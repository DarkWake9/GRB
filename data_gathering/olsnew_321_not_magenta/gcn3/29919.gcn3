The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:55:00 UT on 1 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210501A (trigger 641537705.291634 / 210501205).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 357.8, Dec = -71.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 51m, -71d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 49.0 degrees.
