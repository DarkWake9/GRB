team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 211018A (Arimoto et al. GCN Circ. 30943),
collecting 4.4 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+304.3 ks
and T0+340.2 ks. 

Five uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. We notice that Source 2 and Source 4 are consistent with
catalogued quasars at redshift z = 0.64 and z=1.09, respectively. 
Details of these sources are given below:

Source 1:
  RA (J2000.0):  19.5986  =  01:18:23.66
  Dec (J2000.0): -3.6511  =  -03:39:04.1
  Error: 6.1 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: (2.68 [+1.16, -0.92])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 338 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.
  Flux: (9.3 [+4.0, -3.2])e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 2:
  RA (J2000.0):  19.5656  =  01:18:15.74
  Dec (J2000.0): -3.3800  =  -03:22:48.2
  Error: 5.1 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: (9.6 [+3.9, -3.1])e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 884 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.

Source 3:
  RA (J2000.0):  19.4544  =  01:17:49.06
  Dec (J2000.0): -3.6662  =  -03:39:58.4
  Error: 7.2 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (3.6 [+1.4, -1.1])e-3 ct s^-1   
  Distance: 835 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.
  Flux: (1.85 [+0.70, -0.56])e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)


Source 4:
  RA (J2000.0):  19.5576  =  01:18:13.83
  Dec (J2000.0): -3.7295  =  -03:43:46.2
  Error: 3.2 arcsec (radius, 90% conf. [Enhanced position])
  Count-rate: (6.6 +/- 1.6)e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 636 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.
  Flux: (1.70 +/- 0.40)e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)

Source 5:
  RA (J2000.0):  19.6548  =  01:18:37.16
  Dec (J2000.0): -3.6066  =  -03:36:23.9
  Error: 8.0 arcsec (radius, 90% conf.)
  Count-rate: (2.46 [+1.08, -0.85])e-3 ct s^-1	 
  Distance: 84 arcsec from Fermi/LAT position.
  Flux: (5.3 [+2.3, -1.8])e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (observed, 0.3-10 keV)
