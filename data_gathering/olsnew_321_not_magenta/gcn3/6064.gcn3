and V. F. Polcaro (INAF/IASF Roma) report:

We  continued to monitor the  optical afterglow of GRB 070125
(GCN 6028) with the 152 cm Loiano telescope. Our obsevations were 
done on 2007 Jan 28.927 and Jan 28.946, under not good weather
condition (seeing 3.2 arcsec), with 1200 sec exposure time each.

We identified the optical transient in the two co-added images
with 2-sigma level significance only. We find the following
magnitude: Rc= 20.8+/0.2 (1 sigma).
The photometry is based on the SDSS catalog and the trasformation 
derived from Lupton (2005).

We note that in the SDSS object table there is a faint object at
position:

RA:07:51:17.50
DEC:31:09:04.2

It would be worth while to ascertain by deeper observations
if it is related to the possible host galaxy indicated
by Bloom et al. (GCN 6054).
