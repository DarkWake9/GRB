We observed the field of GRB 180316A (Melandri, et al., GCN 22500) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/03 16.39 to 2018/03 16.52 UTC (4.34 to
7.49 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.29 hours exposure
in the r and i bands.

The afterglow is well-detected within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans, et
al., GCN 22501).   In comparison with the USNO-B1 catalog, we obtain:

  r = 20.07 +/- 0.02
  i = 19.87 +/- 0.02

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source appears so fade in flux
with time as t^(-1.4+/-0.1).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
