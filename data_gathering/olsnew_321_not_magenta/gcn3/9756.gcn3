Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090809 (trigger #359530)
(Markwardt, et al., GCN Circ. 9754).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 328.665, -0.083 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 54m 39.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 04' 58.0" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 43%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, roughly triangularly shaped
peak starting at ~T-1 sec, peaking at ~T+3 sec, and ending at ~T+9 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 5.4 +- 1.3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.0 to T+6.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.4 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.26 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
