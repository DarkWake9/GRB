E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and D. Fox (Penn State) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Using GMOS on the Gemini-south telescope we obtained a 2400 spectrum of 
an apparent galaxy located within the error circle of XRT source #1 (GCN 
6095).  This is the only X-ray source which exhibits signs of fading and 
is the nearest to the BAT error circle of this burst (GCN 6087).  We find 
that the redshift of the galaxy is z=0.314 based on the detection of CaII 
H&K, as well as [OII] and [OIII] emission lines.  At this redshift, the 
isotropic-equivalent energy of the burst is 2.6e48 erg."
