report:

We imaged the field of GRB 141017A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 615672) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 42 min after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field increased from
58 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were excellent.

We examined a series of exposures obtained between
42 min and 110 min. In the error box given by SWIFT XRT
(Marshall et al. GCNC 16919) we detect a source of
magnitude R=22.4 (+/-0.4) which does not seem to be variable.
Its position is 06:14:31.2 -58:34:56 J2000.0.
We do not believe that it is the afterglow of GRB 141017A.

We conclude the afterglow of GRB 141017A is fainter
than R=22.4 42 minutes after the trigger.

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
