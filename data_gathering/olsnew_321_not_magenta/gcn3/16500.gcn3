Three MASTER system telescopes located in Blagoveshchensk, Tunka and
Kislovodsk have observed GRB140629A (Lien et al., GCN 16477) from 33
seconds till ~9 hours after the trigger. MASTER II robotic telescope
(MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) located in Blagoveschensk was
pointed to GRB140629A 15 sec after notice time and 33 sec after
trigger time at 2014-06-29 14:18:03.188 UT and found OT in SWIFT
error-box. MASTER II Tunka was pointed to GRB140629A 78 sec after
trigger time at 2014-06-29 14:18:48.102 UT on the evening twilight sky
(Sun ~5 d. below horizon) with dark sky observations starting ~ 50 min
after trigger time. MASTER II Kislovodsk was pointed to GRB140629A
~3.2 hours after the trigger directly after the Sun set and weather
conditions became suitable.

The optical transient (Lien et al., GCN 16477; Yurkov et al., GCN
16478; Moskvitin et al., GCN 16489; Bikmaev et al., GCN 16482; Masi,
GCN 16483; Maehara, GCN 16484; Malesani et al., GCN 16485; Sonbas et
al., GCN 16486 etc.) has a maximum at ~ 150 sec. after the burst,
reaching 13.8 mag, after which it shows a power law decay. The power
law index (alpha) from 200 to 10000 seconds after the trigger is 1.12
+- 0.1  (F ~ t^-alpha).

There was no polarization more than 3% discovered on afterglow 
stage.
