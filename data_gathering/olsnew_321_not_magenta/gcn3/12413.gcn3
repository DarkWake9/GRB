At 08:05:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111005A (trigger=504779).  Swift did not slew because of
a Sun observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 223.284, -19.730 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 53m 08s
   Dec(J2000) = -19d 43' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 18:03 UT on 2011 December 25. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. J. Saxton (cjs2 AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
