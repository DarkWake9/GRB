 (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) report:

 The position of GRB 090426 (Cummings et al., GCN 9254) was
observed with the 150 cm telescope of Gunma Astronomical
Observatory. Starting at 13:20 and 13:48 UT (0.52 and 1.0 hours
 after the trigger), Ic and Rc frames were acquired for sets of
3 x 3-min and  5 x 5-min exposures, respectively.

 We detected the optical counterpart (e.g., Xin et al., GCN 9255;
 Oates et al., GCN 9265) in all frames. We estimated the Rc and Ic
magnitudes relative to USNO-B1.0 R2 and I, respectively.
