R. Chornock, E. Berger (Harvard), and D. B. Fox (Penn. State) report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We used GMOS on Gemini-North to observe the extended object present in 
the XRT error circle of GRB 110106B (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 11525; 
Beardmore et al. GCN 11532) discovered by Levan et al. (GCN 11534).  We 
obtained 2x1500s of spectroscopy using the R400 grating to cover the 
spectral range 3900-8100 Angstroms, starting on January 7.38 UT. 
Emission lines from [O II], H-beta, and [O III] are present at a common 
redshift of z=0.618.
