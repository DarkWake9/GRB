report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the ultralong GRB 170714A (D'Ai et al.,
GCN 21340) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory beginning on 2017
Jul 28.67 UT (14 days post-burst) for a total exposure of 14.9 ks.
We clearly detect the GRB counterpart with coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 02:17:23.97
Dec(J2000) = +01:59:29.72

with a 68% uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec. This position is consistent with
the XRT position (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/00762535/), and
the optical source reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 21346).
By adopting the spectral parameters of the Swift/XRT analysis (D'Avanzo
et al., GCN 21343), we estimate an average X-ray flux of
~1.1E-14 erg/cm2/s during our observation. This is consistent with a
late-time power-law decay of slope ~-1.

We thank Andrea Prestwich, Belinda Wilkes and the CXC staff for
rapidly scheduling this observation.
