TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3656
SUBJECT: Swift BAT Trigger 146986 is  SWIFT J1753.5-0127

D. Palmer (LANL), S. Barthelmy (GSFC), H. Krimm (GSFC/USRA), C. Markwardt
(GSFC/UMD), and N. Gehrels (GSFC), on behalf of the BAT-Swift team report:

The BAT trigger = 146986, at 05:47:04 UT of 2005-07-21, is the
previously-known
source SWIFT J1753.5-0127.  The corresponding GCN Notice incorrectly
identified it as a GRB.

Note that the earlier Trigger=146970 is still confidently believed to
be GRB 050721A, with X-ray and optical counterparts detected
(GCN circulars 3654 (Antonelli et al.), 3655 (Torii et al.)).
