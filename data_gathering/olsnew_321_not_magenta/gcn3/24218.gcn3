At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate S190425z,
T0=2019-04-25 08:18:05.017 UTC (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and
Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24168), the high-voltage of the CALET
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) detectors were off
(from T0-192 sec to T0+1084 sec).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in high energy trigger mode
at the trigger time of S190425z. Using the CAL data, we have searched for
gamma-ray events in the 10-100 GeV band within the time interval
T0 +/- 60 sec and found no candidates.
The 90% upper limit of CAL is 1.0x10^-4 erg/cm2/s (10-100 GeV) when
the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 5%.
The CAL FOV was centered at RA=131.3 deg, Dec=-43.6 deg at T0.
