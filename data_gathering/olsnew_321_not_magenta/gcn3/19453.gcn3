The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160327A (Racusin et al., GCN 19235) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Mar 27.75, Mar 28.94, Mar 
30.94, Apr 04.79, and Apr 06.83 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at 
the XRT location (Goad et al., GCN 19237), with 3sigma upper limits of 
84 uJy, 69 uJy, 96 uJy, 102 uJy, and 93 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
