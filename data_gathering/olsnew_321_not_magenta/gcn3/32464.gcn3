Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the second optical
afterglow candidate observed by MeerLICHT (de Wet et al. GCN Circ.
32460) of the Fermi/GBM detected burst GRB 220810A (Fermi GBM team, GCN

32455), collecting 4.9 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+156.3 ks and T0+180.2 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 9.9
arcsec of the MeerLICHT optical afterglow candidate position. The
3-sigma upper limit in the field is 0.003 ct  s^-1, corresponding to a
0.3-10 keV observed flux of 1.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical
GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021510.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
