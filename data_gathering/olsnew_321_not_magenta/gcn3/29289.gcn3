Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 01:37:03 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210112A (trigger=1016881).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 218.999, +33.070 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 36m 00s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 04' 13"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks
with the larger peak at T+70 sec and duration of ~150 sec. The peak count rate
was ~20800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~68 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 01:38:18.0 UT, 74.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 219.0044, 33.0566 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 14h 36m 1.06s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 03' 23.8"
with an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 50 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the column
density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 0.1 s image was 7.10e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 82 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	14:36:01.45 = 219.00606
  DEC(J2000) = +33:03:15.4  =  33.05428
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.66 arc sec. This position is 9.8
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
19.52 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.16. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.014.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
