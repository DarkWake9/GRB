of Pan-STARRS 1:

Pan-STARRS 1, a 1.8 m survey telescope located at Haleakala, Hawaii,
observed GRB 130427A (Masell et al., GCNC 14448) a total of 4 times in the
z and y filters using the 1.4 Gigapixel camera, in the course of normal
survey operations. PS1 detected the afterglow (Elenin et al., GCNC 14450),
and the observations were calibrated with the "ubercal" technique (Schafly
et al 2011) and the PS1 reference catalog (Magnier et al 2012). The results
are:

t_mid(hr) exp(s) filter      mag
108.18    80.0    y      19.52 +/- 0.10
108.21    80.0    y      19.66 +/- 0.09
111.35    60.0    z      19.84 +/- 0.07
111.37    60.0    z      19.81 +/- 0.06

Note the host galaxy pre-outburst has been observed in the PS1 3pi survey
and thus photometry of the host galaxy is available.

This discovery was made possible by the PS1 system operated by the
 PS1 Science Consortium and its member institutions (
http://www.ps1sc.org/PS1_System_GCN.shtml ). We thank the telescope
 operators of the PS1 telescope for their support.
