report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 
At 2018-12-12T16:37:45.500 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 181212A (trigger ID: HEB181212692) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM (Fletcher et al., GCN23524) and
Konus-Wind (Frederiks et al., GCN23540).
The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 5.48 s measured from T0+0.72 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+2.07 s, is 8019.2 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 20371.7 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 
Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
fundedjointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
