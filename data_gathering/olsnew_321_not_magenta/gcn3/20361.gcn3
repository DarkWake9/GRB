report on the behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-01-01T02:47:18.27 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 170101B, which was also
detected by the Fermi/GBM (trigger 504953918/170101374).

The POLAR light curve consists of multiple peaks,
with a duration (T90) of 11.2 s measured from T0+0.3 s.
The 0.2-s peak rate measured from T0+8.1 s is 968 cnts/s,
the total counts is about 5217 cnts. The above measurements
are in the energy range of approximately 80-500 keV.

Using the best location from the Fermi/GBM, which is (J2000):
RA:    70.640[deg]
Dec:    -1.580[deg]
Err:     1.2[deg]

the incident angle in POLAR coordinate at T0 is:
theta:    63.43[deg]
phi:   -110.01[deg]

The Minimum Detectable Polarization(MDP) for this burst is
estimated to be ~23.5% [1-sigma, statistical only]. 

All analysis results presented above are preliminary.

POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter (50-500 keV) on-board
the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 launched on Sep 15, 2016.
