Skynet observed the Swift BAT/XRT localization of GRB 160410A (Gibson et al., GCN 19271, Swift trigger=682269) with with one 16" telescope (P5), and two 24" telescopes (P1, P8) of the PROMPT array at CTIO, Chile. Starting at 2016-04-10 05:10:36 UT and continuing until 05:54 UT (t=48s-45m post-trigger), Skynet took a total of 93 exposures ranging from 5-160s in the I band (P1, P5) and the B band (P8).  

We detect a fading optical afterglow in individual and stacked I-band images at the position first reported by Gibson et al. (GCN 19271) and Yates et al. (GCN 19272), with I~17.3 at t=1m and I~19.4 at t=6m.

Magnitudes are in the Vega System, calibrated to 4 APASS DR9 stars in the field.  Magnitudes have not been corrected for line-of-sight Milky Way dust extinction, with expected E(B-V)=0.02 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

No further Skynet observations are scheduled.
