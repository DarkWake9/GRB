Adria C. Updike, Ginger Bryngelson, and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University) report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We observed GRB 080514B (Hurley et al., GCN 7715) using the KPNO 4m
telescope and the NEWFIRM NIR imager under decent weather conditions.  In
4 min of stacked exposures beginning 24 hours and 20 minutes after the
trigger, we detect the afterglow (Postigo et al., GCN 7719) at J = 19.8
+/- 0.2 (as calibrated to the 2MASS catalog).  Observations are ongoing.
