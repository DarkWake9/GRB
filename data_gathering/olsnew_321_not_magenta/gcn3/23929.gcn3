report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team: 

At 2019-02-26T12:21:45.500 (T0), the Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 190226A (trigger ID: HEB190226515) in a routine search of the data, 
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM.

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 0.12 s measured from T0+0.13 s. 
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+0.14 s, is 3602.6 cnts/s. 
The total counts from this burst is 357.0 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
