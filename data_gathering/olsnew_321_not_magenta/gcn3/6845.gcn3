FROM:    Rhaana Starling at U of Leicester  <rlcs1@star.le.ac.uk>

R. Starling (U. Leicester) and P. Schady (MSSL/UCL) report on behalf of 
the Swift team:

Swift XRT observed the GRB 071003 (trigger=292934, Schady et al., GCN 
Circ. 6837) beginning 22 ks after the BAT trigger.
In 2650 s of Photon Counting mode data spanning 22--25 ks after the 
trigger a bright X-ray source (approximate count rate 0.1 count/s) is 
detected at the position RA,Dec = 301.85102, +10.94688 deg, equivalent to:
RA(J2000) =  20h 07m 24.25s
Dec(J2000)= +10d 56' 48.8"
with an error of radius 5.7 arcseconds (90%, including boresight 
uncertainties). This is 35.5 arcseconds from the BAT refined position 
(Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ. 6842) and 3.6 arcseconds from the optical 
afterglow position (Li, GCN Circ. 6838). 
Further analysis will be reported in a subsequent circular.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
