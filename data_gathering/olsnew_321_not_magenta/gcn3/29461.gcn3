On behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

We observed the localization region of the neutrino event IceCube-210210A (Lagunas et. al, GCN 29454) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope, equipped with the 47 square degree ZTF camera (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019). We started observations in the g- and r-band beginning at 2021-02-10 12:07 UTC, approximately 0.2 hours after event time. We covered 2.1 sq deg, corresponding to 78.6% of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. Each exposure was 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag.
 
The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2020) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We are left with two high-significance transient candidates from our pipeline, both lying within the 90.0% localization of the skymap.

Both candidates are possible transients, with no prior detections, that have not yet been spectroscopically classified. Additional target-of-opportunity observations with ZTF are planned for 2021-02-11 as part of our neutrino follow-up program (Stein et al. 2020).

Based on observations obtained with the Samuel Oschin Telescope 48-inch and the 60-inch Telescope at the Palomar Observatory as part of the Zwicky Transient Facility project.
