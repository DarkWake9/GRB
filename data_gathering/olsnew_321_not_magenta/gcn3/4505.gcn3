TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4505
SUBJECT: GRB 060114: A long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    06/01/14 16:52:54 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@iasf-milano.inaf.it>

S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Shaw, P.Haymoz, M. Beck 
(ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 100 s and with a FRED profile has been detected by IBAS 
in IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:39:44 on January 14 2006.

The coordinates (J2000) derived by the automatic IBAS analysis are:
RA = 195.280
Dec=  -4.721

with an uncertainty of about 3 arcmin. An offline analysis to refine the 
position is ongoing. 

The GRB preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.3
ph/cmq/s and the  fluence (20-200 keV, 100 s integration time) 
is about 1.3e-6 erg/cmq

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
