on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed   the error box of  GRB060211b (Mateos et al., GCN 4739) with
1.5m telescope of Maidanak Astronomical Observatory. We started the
observation  on Jan. 11 (UT) 16:15:54 (i.e. 20.7 minutes after GRB) and took
a series of 300 sec frames in R-band. In a first frame of 300 s exposure we
do net reveal any optical source within refined XRT error circle (Kennea et
al., GCN 4743). The limiting magnitude of the first  frame is 19.3R as
calibrated against USNO B1.0. Further analysis is underway.
