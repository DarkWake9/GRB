The long bright GRB 061122 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 5834, 5836)
triggered Konus-Wind at 28608.132 s UT (07:56:48.132).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~10 s,
fluence 2.31(-0.12, +0.05)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
the 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+3.104 s
8.81(-1.05, +0.83)x10^-6  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB
(from T0 to T0+12.032 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 1.03 (-0.07, +0.06)
and Ep = 160 (-7, +8) keV (chi2 = 64/62 dof).
The fitting by GRBM (band) model yields only an upper limit on
high energy photon index: beta < -3.31.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
