The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 23:20:21 UT on 21 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220521A (trigger 674868026.727134 / 220521972).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 292.6, Dec = 3.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 30m, 3d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88.0 degrees.
