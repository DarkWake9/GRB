M. Goad (UL), C. Pagani (PSU), K. Page (UL) and D. Burrows (PSU) 
report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the ground data from GRB 050908 (BAT Trigger #154112). 
We find a previously uncatalogued, X-ray source at the following 
coordinates:

RA(J2000):  01 21 50.3
Dec(J2000): -12 57 20.3

with an uncertainty of 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This 
position is 56.6 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3942 
(Goad et al.) and 7.3 arseconds from the optical counterpart reported in
GCN 3943 (Torii).
