behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 180205A (Evens et al., GCN 22381) using the 
1m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China, and 10x60s R-band 
frames, starting at 16:31:07 UT on 2018-02-05.

The optical afterglow (e.g., Evens et al., GCN 22381; Zheng et al., GCN 
22382) is clearly detected in our stacked image.

Preliminary photometry results are as follows:

Tmid-T0  Exposure  Filter   Mag   MagErr
  (hr)           (s)
12.15     10x60       R       19.67    0.10

Photometry is calibrated with nearby SDSS stars, and errors are only 
statistical values.
