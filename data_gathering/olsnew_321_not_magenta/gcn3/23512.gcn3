D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 60 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 8:41  UT of December 5, 2018.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:
R.A.= 199.9536 deg
DEC.=   8.1975 deg

with an uncertainty of  1.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of 0.8  counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration  time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 2e-6
erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
