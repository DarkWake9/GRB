K. Wiersema (University of Leicester) reports on behalf of the Oadby 
Transients Team:

We observed the field of GRB 160228A (Malesani et al. GCN 19107) using the
0.5m telescope at the observatory of the University of Leicester, at Oadby (UK).
In a series of V band exposures, starting at 19:52 UT on 28 February 2016 (~2.3 hours
after burst), we find no source in or near the XRT error circle (Beardmore et al. 
GCN 19110) to a limit of V<19.5 mag.
