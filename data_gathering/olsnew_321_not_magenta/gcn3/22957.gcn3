P. Romano (INAF-OAB) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 14:04:34 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located AX 1631.9-4752 (trigger=848584).  Swift did not slew. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 248.070, -47.809, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 32m 17s
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 48' 33"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time 
light curve does not show anything significant. 

BAT is currently configured to alert on this SFXT (Supergiant Fast 
X-ray Transient), but give it a low merit value so that it will 
not automatically slew.  However, a ToO observation is planned 
for ~T+3 hours.
