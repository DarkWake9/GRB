reports:

On 11 23, 2021, at 03:52:23.50 UTC, HAWC detected a burst signal
from its Burst Monitoring named HAWC-211123A. This monitor system looks
for excesses above the expected background in time windows of 0.2, 1, 10
and 100 seconds.
This event was found in the 1-second time window starting
at the reported trigger time.

The position of the alert is
RA (J200): 34.12 deg
Dec (J2000): -8.05 deg
Location uncertainty (68% containment): 0.60 deg (statistical only).

The monitor system found that this alert has a false alarm rate of 1.92
alert(s) per year.
We encourage follow-up observations of the HAWC alert region. We however
note that it is
consistent with background expectations based on the observation time.
