Daniele Malesani (SISSA/ISAS), Luigi Stella (INAF/OAR), Stefano Covino 
(INAF/OABr), Chris Lidman, and Dominique Naef (ESO), report on behalf of 
the MISTICI collaboration:

We observed the field of the short GRB 061006 (Schady et al., GCN 5699; 
Krimm et al., GCN 5704), with the ESO-VLT UT2 equipped with FORS1. 
Observations, carried out in the I band, started on 2006 Oct 7.30728 UT 
(14.6 hr after the GRB).

Inside the XRT error box (Troja et al., GCN 5703), we find a single, 
faint source at the coordinates (J2000, 0.5" accuracy):

 alpha = 07:24:07.66
 delta = -79:11:55.1

There is a further, brighter, pointlike source outside the error circle 
(9.9" away of the XRT position) at

 alpha = 07:24:03.3
 delta = -79:11:52.46

At the present stage, it is not clear whether any of these objects is 
related to the GRB. Further observations are planned to look for 
variability. There are also no apparent bright galaxies in the proximity 
of the XRT position.

We acknowledge excellent support from the VLT staff. This message can be 
cited.
