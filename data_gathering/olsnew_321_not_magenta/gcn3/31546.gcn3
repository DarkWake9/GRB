We report an analysis of observations of the vicinity of the high-energy 
IC220202A neutrino event (GCN 31543) with all-sky survey data from the 
Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space 
Telescope. The IceCube event was detected on 2022-02-02 11:48:38.59 UTC 
(T0) with J2000 position RA = 21.36 (+1.10, -0.77) deg, Decl. = -3.88 
(+0.42, -0.64) deg 90% PSF containment. No cataloged gamma-ray sources 
are found within the 90% IC220202A localization error (The Fourth 
Fermi-LAT catalog DR3; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, arXiv:2201.11184).

We searched for the existence of intermediate (months to years) 
timescale emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary 
analysis indicates no significant (>5sigma) new excess emission (> 100 
MeV) at the the IC220202A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law 
spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC220202A 
best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 
2.4-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~13-years (2008-08-04 / 2022-02-02 UTC), < 
3.7e-9 (< 5.7e-8) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time 
before T0.

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular 
monitoring of this source will continue. For these observations the 
Fermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at desy.de) 
and S. Buson (sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair 
conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to 
greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international 
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific 
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
