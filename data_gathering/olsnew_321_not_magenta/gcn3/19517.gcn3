The long-duration GRB 160607A (Swift, Ukwatta et al. GCN Circ. 19502; Konus-Wind
trigger time on 11:13:56.92 UT; INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7487) triggered the CALET
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 11:13:57.49 on 7 June 2016.   The burst signal
was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a complex structure with multiple spikes.
The emission starts at T0 and ends at T0+30 sec.  The multiple spikes peak
at T0+2 sec, T0+4 sec, T0+7 sec, T0+11 sec,  T0+14 sec, T0+15 sec and T0+21 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 18.9 +- 2.9 sec (40-1000 keV).
The light curve is available at

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center
located at the Waseda University.
