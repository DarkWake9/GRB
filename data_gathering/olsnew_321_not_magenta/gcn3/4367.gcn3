J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) reports:

Following the discovery of the XRT position of GRB 051221 (Burrows  
GCN 4366), we inspected our PAIRITEL mosaics (GCN 4365) and found a  
faint, red source to the south of the XRT position by 3.2 arcsec with  
the coordinates:

   21:54:48.65, +16:53:25.1

Photometry and improved astrometry are still in progress.

A finding chart will be posted to
