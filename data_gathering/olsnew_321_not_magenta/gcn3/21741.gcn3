report on behalf of the MAXI team:

We examined the MAXI/GSC all-sky X-ray images (2-20 keV) obtained
in the orbit and the day after the LVC trigger
G299232 at 2017-08-25 13:13:31 UTC (GCN 21693).

At the trigger time of G299232,
the high-voltage of MAXI/GSC was off, and it was turned on at T0+1480 sec.
GSC scanned more than 56% of the whole sky in the 92-min orbit,
which includes 69.0% of the 90% region in the bayestar skymap.
scanned from 13:13:31 UTC.
One day image obtained between 08-25 13:13:31 and 08-26 12:03:01 UTC
covers 99.0% of the 90% region in the bayestar skymap.
No significant new source was found in these images
and the 2-20 keV averaged photon counts in the skymap region is 0.41
counts/cm2/sec.
The 3-sigma averaged upper limits
obtained from the one-scan and one-day images in the bayestar skymap are
39 and 12 mCrab, respectively
(see Serino et al., 2017 for the upper limit calculation).
