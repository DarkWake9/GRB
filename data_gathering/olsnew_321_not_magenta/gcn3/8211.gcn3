P.A. Evans, J.P. Osborne, O. Godet (U. Leicester), J.A. Kennea, A. Falcone (PSU) 
and S. Campana (INAF-OAB) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 564 s of promptly downlinked event data for the recent BAT trigger 324362
(GCN Circ 8209) we find an X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec:
40.13177, +61.22941 which is equivalent to:
    RA(J2000)  = 02h 40m 31.63s
    Dec(J2000) = +61d 13' 45.9"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 140 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle, and consistent with the catalogued position of the high energy 
gamma-ray emitting high mass X-ray binary LS I +61 303 (=V615 Cas)

The observed 0.3-10 keV flux from this source is 1.93 (+0.27, -0.67) x 10^-11 
erg/cm**2/s, consistent the RXTE/ASM flux reported by (Leahy 2001)

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
