D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), V. D'Elia (INAF/OAR and ASI/ASDC), P. D'Avanzo 
(INAF/OABr), A. Melandri (INAF/OABr), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), V. Lorenzi 
(INAF/TNG), Albar Garcia de Gurtubai Escudero (INAF/TNG), report on 
behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150222A (Bernardini et al., GCN 17486) with 
the 3.6m TNG telescope equipped with the DOLoRes camera. Observations 
consisted of 4 images in the I band for a total of 20 min exposure. The 
seeing was poor (3.2").

No object is detected within the (currently unenhanced) XRT position, 
down to a limiting magnitude I > 22.3 (calibrated against nearby USNO 
stars). The mean time of the observation was 2015 Feb 23.055 UT, that is 
8.4 hr after the GRB.
