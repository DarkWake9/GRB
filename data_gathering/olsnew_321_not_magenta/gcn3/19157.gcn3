S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. A. Kennea (PSU), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 16:01:28 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered (678197) on noise 
that happened to be within the 20 arcmin of SGR_0501+4516 in the on-board catalog. 
Swift did not immediately slew because of the earth-limb observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 75.155, +45.079 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 00m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 04' 44"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical with image triggers (64 sec in this case),
nothing significant is seen in the real-time light curve.
