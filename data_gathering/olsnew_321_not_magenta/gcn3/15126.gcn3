We report the spectral lag analysis for GRB 130822A (Kocevski, et al., GCN Circ. 15112) 
based on the BAT data.  Using 1-ms binned light curve, the spectral lag for the 15-25 keV 
to 50-100 keV bands is 2.6 (+3.5/-3.2) ms.  Since the lag value is consistent with zero, we 
believe this burst belongs to a short burst category.  There is no evidence for extended 
emission.
