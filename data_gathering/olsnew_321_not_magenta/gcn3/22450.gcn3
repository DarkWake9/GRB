report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:
 
At 2018-02-10T12:24:38.55 UT, the Insight-HXMT/HE detected
GRB 180210A(trigger ID: HEB180210517) in a routine search of the data,
which was also triggered by Fermi/GBM(GCN Circ. 22407),Fermi/LAT(GCN Circ. 22408), 
Swift/XRT(GCN Circ. 22413) and KONUS-Wind(GCN Circ. 22415).
 
The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve consists of a multi-peaked pulse
with a duration (T90) of 26.7 s measured from T0+3.9 s.
The 1-s peak rate, measured from T0+23.9 s, is 3173.8 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 40447.9 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-8 to T0+30 s is adequately fit by a Power
Law model with spectral index = -1.86 +/- 0.03. The energy fluence is 
(4.5 +/- 0.2) E-05 erg/cm^2 in 200 - 5000 keV in this time interval.
 
The analysis results presented above are preliminary, 
final results will be published elsewhere.
 
Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
