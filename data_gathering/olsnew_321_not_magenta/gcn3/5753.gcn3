T.Mineo (IASF-Pa), V.Mangano (IASF-Pa), G.Cusumano (IASF-Pa),
and B.Sbarufatti (IASF-Pa) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

Swift/XRT began a target of opportunity observation of the INTEGRAL
detected GRB 061025 (Mereghetti et al., GCN Circ. 5751) at 20:08 UT
October 25 2006 (~2 hours after the burst). We have analyzed the first
3 orbits of XRT data (2000 s exposure) and we find a previously
uncatalogued source at the following coordinates:

RA(J2000):    20h03m36.97
Dec(J2000):   -48:14:37.39

with an estimated uncertainty of 5.35 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
Data have been processed with the new TELDEF files that include the new
boresight information (Burrows et al. 2006 GCN. 5750).
This position is 19.3 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position given in GCN
Circ. 5751. Further observations and analysis are in progress.
