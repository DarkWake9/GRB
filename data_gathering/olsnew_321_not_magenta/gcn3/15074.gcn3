Using the data set from T-120 to T+182 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of the burst from SGR 1745-29 (trigger #565443)
(Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 15069).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 266.403, -29.017 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  17h 45m 36.8s
    Dec(J2000) = -29d 01' 02.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak with some substructure at
low significance.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.011 +- 0.002 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.00 to T+0.01 sec is best fit by functions
exponentially declining with energy in the BAT energy range.  A blackbody fit
is formally the best fit with kT = 8.9 +/- 0.2.  A simple powerlaw fit has a
power law index of the time-averaged spectrum of 2.54 +- 0.26.  The fluence in
the 15-150 keV band is 9.2 +- 1.6 x 10^-09 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured from T+0.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 22.1 +- 3.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All
the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
