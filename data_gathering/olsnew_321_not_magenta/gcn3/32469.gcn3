J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), 
J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB), T. Sbarrato (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB) 
and P.A.  Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the first optical afterglow candidate observed by 
MeerLICHT (de Wet et al. GCN Circ. 32460) of the Fermi/GBM detected burst GRB 220810A 
(Fermi GBM team, GCN 32455), collecting 2.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between 
T0+202.1 ks and T0+208.1 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected at the MeerLICHT optical afterglow candidate position. 
The 3-sigma upper limit in the field is 0.006 ct  s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux 
of 2.2e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).
