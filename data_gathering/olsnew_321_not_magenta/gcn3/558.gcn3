SUBJECT: GRB 000115, BVRI field photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for the field
of GRB000115 with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on two
photometric nights.  This is a single 11x11arcmin field
located towards the southeastern corner of the RXTE error box.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000115.dat
The astrometry in these files is based on linear plate
solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.  The internal errors
are less than 100mas.  As no optical counterpart has been
identified, only aperture photometry has been performed and
the file does not go as faint as for previous fields.
