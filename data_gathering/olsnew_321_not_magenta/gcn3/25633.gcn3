The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 17:19:36 UT on 3 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190903A (trigger 589223981.255486 / 190903722).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 62.4, Dec = -64.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 09m, -64d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
