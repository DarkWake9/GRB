The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo report:



We have completed offline calibration and re-analysis of the segment of
data containing the gravitational-wave trigger G184098, which was first
recovered on 2015-09-14 (GCN 18330, GCN 18388).



We have calculated a revised false alarm rate based on four detection
pipelines: the cWB (with and without BayesWave follow-up) and oLIB searches
for un-modeled bursts plus the PyCBC and GSTLAL offline searches for
compact binary coalescences of neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black
holes. All four pipelines estimate that G184098 is more significant than
one per hundred years.
