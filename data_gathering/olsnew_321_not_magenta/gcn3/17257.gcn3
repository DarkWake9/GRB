O.J. Roberts (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:24:22.64 UT on the 30th of December 2014, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 141230A
(trigger 441602665 / 141230142 ). The GBM on-ground location,
using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 57.0, Dec =+1.6,
with an uncertainty of 3.3 degrees (radius, 1-sigma
containment,statistical only; there is additionally a
systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to
3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 120 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single FRED-like peak with
a duration (T90) of about 9.9 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+5.1 s is well fit by a power law
function with an an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power
law index is -1.51 +/- 0.19 and the cutoff energy, parameterized
as Epeak, is 75 +/- 16 keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in
this time interval is (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-06  erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak
photon flux measured starting from T0+0.1 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 8.4 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
