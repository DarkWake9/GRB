At 2014-04-14T06:06:29, IPN spacecraft triggered on GRB 140414A.  The burst
was about 0.7 seconds long, and appears to be in the SHB category. Swift was
executing a pre-planned slew maneuver at this time.  A mosaic image made from
BAT event data collected during the slew shows a 12 sigma source at
RA, Dec 195.310, +56.902, which is:

RA (J2000) 13h 01m 14.3s 	
Dec (J2000) 56d 54' 06"

with an estimated uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin (90% containment)

A Swift TOO request has been submitted to locate the afterglow with XRT.
