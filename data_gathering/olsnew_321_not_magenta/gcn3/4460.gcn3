"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 060109 (GCN 4455) with the unfiltered CCD camera on
the 30-cm telescope at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 20:10:19 UT on Jan.09.
After co-adding a set of 6 images (20:10:19 - 20:18:06 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter
than 17.4mag."
