The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:21:45 UT on 28 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201228B (trigger 630861710.97237 / 201228640).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 8.1, Dec = 50.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 00h 32m, 50d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 20.0 degrees.
