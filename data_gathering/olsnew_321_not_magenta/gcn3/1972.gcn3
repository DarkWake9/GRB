G. Masi (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and European Southern Observatory, 
Chile), B. L. Jensen, J. Hjorth (Copenhagen University) and R. Michelsen 
(Astronomical Observatory, Copenhagen) report: 

We imaged the field around the GRB030324 event (trigger 2641) on March 24, 
05:10 UT, with the 1.54-m Danish Telescope (La Silla) + DFOSC CCD, covering 
a field of 13x13 square arcmins. Adding three 180s R-band images, we do not 
see any obvious OT candidate down to the limit of the DSS-2 (R-band).
