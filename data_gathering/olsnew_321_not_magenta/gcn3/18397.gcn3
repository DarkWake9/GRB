 We report on further observations performed with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at ESO-Paranal equipped with OMEGACAM (FOV=1 square degree) to improve the coverage of the
+skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger G184098.

 Since September 17, the area of the sky covered by VST observations increased to ~90 square degree, overlapping the 54 square degree observed on September 16. These new se
+ts of observations were taken in the r-sloan band and 80 sec exposure time each and have been performed on 17/09, 21/09, 24/09 and 30/09.

The 3 x 3 degree pointings are centered on the following coordinates RA, Dec (J2000):

03:48:53        -56:29:24
03:58:22        -59:24:00
04:30:46        -64:21:00
04:53:29        -66:20:24
05:22:57        -67:30:00
05:58:00        -70:43:48
06:34:45        -70:43:48
07:47:40        -70:38:24
08:05:57        -67:31:12
08:38:40        -67:31:12

The image analysis is ongoing.
Further observations of these fields are planned for one more night.
