Fred Piron (LPTA), Francesco Longo (INFN/Trieste), 
Giulia Iafrate (INAF/OA Trieste), Teddy Cheung (NASA/GSFC), 
Hiro Tajima (SLAC) and Valerie Connaughton (UAH) report on 
behalf of the Fermi LAT collaboration:

Ground processing of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 
reveals that the LAT significantly detects emission from GRB 090626, 
reported as a bright Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) burst (von 
Kienlin GCN 9579).

The LAT localization of this burst is RA, Dec = 170.01, -33.50 ± 
0.32 deg (statistical, 95% CL), with an additional systematic error 
estimated at 0.1 deg.   There appears to be significant emission 
above 100 MeV until about 250 s after the GBM trigger time.  
Further information will be available following more detailed 
analysis.

The point of contact for this burst is Fred Piron 
(frederic.piron@lpta.in2p3.fr).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the 
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of 
an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and 
many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
