TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4534
SUBJECT: GRB 060117: nearby galaxy

N.R. Tanvir (U. Hertfordshire) notes:

The galaxy that is within 2.7 arcmin of the BAT position of GRB 060117
(GCN 4533) is at redshift z=0.042, and there are other galaxies visible
on DSS2 in the same field, which could well be at similar redshift.
Given the high luminosity of this burst, it is therefore a candidate
to be at low-redshift, and followup observations are encouraged, despite
the poor location on the sky.
