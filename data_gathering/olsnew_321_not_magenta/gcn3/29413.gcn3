(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of ZTF21aagwbjr (Kool et
al., 29405), which may be related to the Fermi/GBM / GECAM / IPN
detected burst GRB 210204A (GCN Circ., 29390, GCN Circ. 29392, GCN
Circ. 29408), collecting 2.9 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data
between T0+160.9 ks and T0+173.2 ks. 

An uncatalogued X-ray source is detected consistent with being within 1
arcsec of the ZTF position and is believed to be the afterglow, or at
least, the X-ray counterpart of the ZTF21aagwbjr. Using 2886 s of PC
mode data and 6 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using
the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1
catalogue): RA, Dec = 117.08071, +11.40951 which is equivalent to:
RA (J2000): 07h 48m 19.37s
Dec(J2000): +11d 24' 34.2"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 0.7 arcsec from the ZTF position.  The light curve is
consistent with a constant source of mean count rate 9.1e-02 ct/sec. 

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.73 (+0.31, -0.29). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.7 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 3.5 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 4.0 x 10^-11 (4.9 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.7 (+1.3, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 3.5 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.0 sigma
Photon index:	     1.73 (+0.31, -0.29)
