In response to the LIGO/Virgo GW event G298936 (T0 = 2017-08-23 13:13:58.518
UTC; GCN #21656), analysis of AGILE data shows that the satellite at T0 was
in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). Scientific telemetry was inhibited
during the time interval (T0 -300 s; T0 + 500 s).

At the moment of data acquisition obtained near the time interval defined above
we obtained preliminary 3-sigma fluence upper limits (UL) for a 1 s integration
time at different celestial positions within the G298936 90% c.l. localization
region, from a minimum of 5.1e-7 erg cm^-2 to a maximum of 7.8e-7 erg cm^-2
(assuming as spectral model a power law with photon index 1.4).
The AGILE-MCAL detector has a full solid angle acceptance, and is operational
in the range 0.4 - 100 MeV. The MCAL current trigger rate is on average ~ 0.15
every 20 sec.

Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
