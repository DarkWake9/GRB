During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long
burst, GRB 210909B, at 2021-09-09T20:02:33.600 UTC (denoted as T0), 
which was also detected by INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS.

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 15-3500 keV, 
this burst mainly consists of a broad pulse with a duration of about 10 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000):
Ra: 358.6 deg
Dec: -74.9 deg
Err: 1.1 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees. 

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
