MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru) 
located in  Vostryakovo (Alexander Krylov Observatory) was pointed to the 
GRB140521A 4553 sec after trigger time at 2014-05-21 18:50:11 directly 
after sunset.  We haven`t found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box 
(Troja et. al GCN 16311) on single and coadd images.
In table 1 the images upper limits are provided.

* First image with stars on bright evening sky.
C is  our white (clear) band which is well described by a parity 0.8R+0.2B (USNO B1).
T is a  GRB trigger time.


Another  two  MASTER II  robotic telescope  located in Kislovodsk and  Blagoveschensk
was pointed to the  GRB140521A 21 sec after notice time and 36 sec after 
trigger time at 2014-05-21 17:34:54 UT. But observations were spoiled due 
to bad weather condition.  We have a set of images from that observatories 
with different exposures from 10 to 180 and formal upper limit from 13 to 
16 during first hour after the burst. However bad quality of images (due 
to wind and clouds) don't allow to carry out transient search.
