The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 03:57:24 UT on 12 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190612A (trigger 582004649.64834 / 190612165).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 223.9, Dec = 62.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 55m, 62d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 120.0 degrees.
