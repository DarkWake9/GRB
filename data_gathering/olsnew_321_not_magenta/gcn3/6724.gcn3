Using the data set from T-120 to T+218 sec from the recent telemetry 
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070808 (trigger #287260)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 6718).  The BAT ground-calculated position 
is RA, Dec = 6.761, 1.180 deg which is 
   RA(J2000) = 0h 27m 2.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = 1d 10' 47" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 47%.
 
The burst had a single FRED peak. T90 (15-350 keV) was 32 +- 3 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.7 to T+41.4 sec is best fit by a 
simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged 
spectrum is 1.47 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band was 
1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from 
T+0.73 sec in the 15-150 keV band was 2.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the 
quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
