P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB)
and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:10:45 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRS 1716-249/GRO J1719-24/V2293 Oph (trigger=731183). Swift 
did not slew because of the Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 259.882, -24.994 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 19m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = -24d 59' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed no obvious structure, 
as is typical for image triggers. 

This source is in Sun observing constraint until January 27. So there will be
no XRT or UVOT observations until then. 

This source recently triggered BAT on January 1st 2017 (Barthelmy et
al. GCN Circ. 20352, Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 20356), and it has been
reported in outburst by MAXI/GSC (Negoro et al. ATEL #9876 and
Masumitsu et al. ATEL #9895).
