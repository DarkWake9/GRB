Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060717 (trigger #219646)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 5326).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA,Dec = 170.851,+28.970 deg {11h 23m 24.2s,+28d 58' 12.5"} (J2000)
+- 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 99%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak which is most prominent in the
15-50 keV energy band and not detectable above 100 keV.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
3.0 +- 1 sec (estimated error including systematics).  The standard Norris
lag analysis for this burst is 250 +/- 250 msec (15-25 to 50-100 keV
energy bands for the CCF).  This plus the soft spectrum indicate that this
is not a short GRB.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+2.8 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.72 +- 0.38.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.5 +- 1.6 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.78 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
