GRB050401: Radio observation at 610 MHz with GMRT

Poonam Chandra and Alak Ray (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
(TIFR), Mumbai) report the observation of GRB 050401 with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2005 April 2.77 (UT) at 617 MHz
frequency with a bandwidth of 32 MHz. No radio emission is seen either at
the Optical Transient afterglow position (GCN 3163) or the revised Swift
BAT position (GCN 3173).  The map rms is 0.23 mJy and 2-Sigma upper limit
to the GRB flux density is 0.46 mJy.

We thank the GMRT staff, in particular the National Centre for Radio
Astrophysics (NCRA) Director Dr. Rajaram Nityananda for making the
observations possible, and Dr. Paolo Freire, Yashwant Gupta and
collaborators for allowing a part of their time to be used for this
observation. GMRT is run by NCRA-TIFR.  This observation was Target of
Opportunity observation and the observing time was granted as
discretionary time at the GMRT.
