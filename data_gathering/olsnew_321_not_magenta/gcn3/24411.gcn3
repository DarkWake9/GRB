LIGO/Virgo S190426c: Update on Source Classification

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration report:

Based on posterior support from preliminary parameter estimation
[1,2], under the assumption that the candidate S190426c is
astrophysical in origin, the relative probabilities amongst
the signal categories NSBH : MassGap : BNS : BBH are revised
to be approximately 12 : 5 : 3 : 0.

Under the same assumption of astrophysical origin, we find
strong evidence that the lighter compact object has a
mass < 3 solar masses (HasNS: >99%) and a 72% probability
of having disrupted material outside the final compact object
(HasRemnant: 72%).

The probability of non-astrophysical origin and the false
alarm rate are not being updated at this time; both measures
of significance should be expected to change with offline analyses
and continued observations.
