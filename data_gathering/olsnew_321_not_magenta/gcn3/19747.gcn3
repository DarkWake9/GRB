P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Keivani (PSU), D.B. Fox
(PSU), G. Tesic (PSU), D.F. Cowen (PSU), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester),
M.W.E. Smith (JPL) and F.E. Marshall (GSFC) report on behalf of the
Swift-IceCube collaboration:

Swift has observed the field of the IceCube HESE event IceCube-160731A,
"AMON ICECUBE HESE 128290 6888376" (revision 0), utilising the on-board
19-point tiling pattern to cover a region centred on RA,Dec (J2000) =
(215.109, -0.458), with a radius of approximately 0.8 degrees. Swift-XRT
collected ~800 s per field of PC mode data per tile. The observations
were taken between 03:00:46 and 14:51:52 on 2016 Jul 31 (i.e. from
3.9 ks to 46.5 ks after the neutrino trigger), and covered 2.1
square degrees.

Six X-ray sources are detected in the observations. All of these
correspond either to known X-ray emitters, or to objects catalogued
(e.g. in SIMBAD) and from which X-rays may be expected. Therefore, we
conclude that we have not discovered a transient X-ray event associated
with the IceCube trigger. The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate in
the rest of the field is 0.01 ct s^-1, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV
flux of 4.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a typical AGN spectrum (NH=3e20
cm^-2, Gamma=1.7). Overlaps between the different tiles accounts for 0.5
square degrees: in these regions the 3-sigma upper limit is 0.0071 ct
s^-1, corresponding to 3.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

No transient sources were detected in the UVOT data, down to a 3-sigma
upper limit of 18.0, in the u filter.

Details of the six detected X-ray sources are below. All fluxes are
0.3-10 keV and assume the same AGN spectrum as above.

Error:       4.2 arcsec (90% confidence radius)
Count rate:  (1.7 +/- 0.4) x 10^-2 ct s^-1
Flux:        (7.3 +/- 1.7) x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
Notes:       This source is 2.4" from HD 125981 which SIMBAD lists as an
              A0IV star (classified by the Michigan Spectral Survey).
              This detection may not be due to an X-ray source, but due
              to the bright (V = 6.7) stellar optical flux.

              as a quasar, and 3.1" from the known X-ray source,
              3XMM J142253.3-000149. The observed  X-ray flux is
              consistent with the flux in the 3XMM catalogue.

              (1SXPS J142252.8-003553) and the observed flux is
              consistent with the catalogued values.
