The long GRB 200729A (Swift trigger #984929:
Evans et al., GCN 28165, Krimm et al., GCN 28179;
Fermi-GBM Sub-Threshold  candidate: Malacaria et al., GCN 28174)
was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a single emission episode
with a duration of ~ 74 s.

The K-W light curve of this burst is available at
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB200729A/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
5.23(-1.00,+1.32)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944-s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)+5.8 s, of 2.18(-0.55,+0.66)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 - 1500 keV energy range).

The K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from ~T0(BAT) s to ~T0(BAT)+73.5 s)
is well described by a cutoff power-law model
with alpha = -0.47(-0.3,+0.5) and Ep = 269(-65,+105) keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
