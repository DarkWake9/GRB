RXTE observed GRB 050318 starting at 17:47 UTC (123 minutes after the
BAT trigger), at the BAT reported position (Krimm et al, GCN Circ
#3111).  The exposure was 768 seconds.  The RXTE PCA is a non-imaging
instrument with a field of view of approximately 1 degree (FWHM).

A PCA flux of 7E-12 erg/s/cm^2 was detected (2-10 keV), which is about
four times the expected fluctuations due to the cosmic X-ray
background.  The flux is primarily below 6 keV.  No obvious temporal
variations are detected.
