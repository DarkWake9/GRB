K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the NEAR GRB team, and M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, report:

Although GRB991105 (GCN 433) was too weak to be observed by Ulysses, it
was observed by NEAR.  The preliminary IPN annulus for it is centered
at RA=187.6492 deg., Decl.=-7.9319 deg. (J2000), and has a radius of
58.9882 +/-  0.0607 deg. (3 sigma).  The annulus width is therefore
about equal to the WFC error circle diameter, but it intersects it at:

RA(2000)	Decl.(2000)
12 h 03 m 52 s  -66 o  48' 13"
12 h 02 m 59 s  -66 o  47' 30"

and therefore reduces the WFC area slightly.  

A map may be found at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/991105/.  Some refinements
to this annulus are expected which should further reduce the WFC error
circle area.
