C. Malacaria (NASA-MSFC/USRA) and C.Meegan (UAH)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:09:42.72 UT on 26 August 2020, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200826B (trigger 620172587 / 200826923).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, was reported in GCN 28292.

The GBM light curve shows an exceptionally bright long GRB
with a duration (T90) of about 7.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.003 s to T0+ 12.544 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 410.3 +/- 5.6  keV,
alpha = -0.64 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.52 +/- 0.04
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.414 +/- 0.006)E-04 erg/cm^2. 
The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+5.1 s in 
the 10-1000 keV band is 110.1 +/- 0.7 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
