of the Swift Team:

At 21:14:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140311B (trigger=591392).  Swift could not immediately
slew to the burst due to the Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 252.291, +52.747 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 49m 10s
   Dec(J2000) = +52d 44' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  We are awaiting information on the BAT 
light curve. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+55
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

The observation of this burst will delay the observation of GRB 140311A. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (judith.racusin AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
