report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 05:59:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130603A (trigger=557274).  Swift could not immediately slew
to the burst due to an Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 86.954, +82.934 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 47m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = +82d 56' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single
FRED structure with a duration of about 100 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1275 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+49.7
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Melandri (andrea.melandri AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
