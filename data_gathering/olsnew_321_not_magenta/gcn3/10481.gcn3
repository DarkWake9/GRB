Adria C. Updike (Clemson University), Peter A. Milne (Steward
Observatory), G. Grant Williams (MMTO), and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100305A (Troja et al., GCN 10470) with the
0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope located at Kitt Peak National Observatory
beginning 106 seconds after the trigger.  Observations were
carried out in the R band for approximately 45 minutes under good
conditions.  We do not detect any sources within the XRT enhanced error
circle (Osborne et al., GCN 10474) or the source detected by Gemini-N
(Cucchiara, GCN 10473).
