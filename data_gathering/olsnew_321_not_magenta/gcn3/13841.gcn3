GRB 120804A: Late-time Chandra observation 

David N. Burrows (PSU), Bin-Bin Zhang (PSU) and Eleonora Troja
(NASA/GSFC/UMCP) report:

We re-observed the field of GRB 120804A (Lien et al., GCN Circ. 13573)
with the Chandra ACIS instrument, starting on September 18, 2012 
16:04:50 UT (~46 days after the GRB trigger), for a total exposure of 
60 ks. The X-ray afterglow is clearly detected at the 10 sigma level.  
The inferred flux is consistent with an extrapolation of 
the earlier Swift XRT observations (Troja et al., GCN Circ. 13640) and the 
XMM observation (Margutti et al. (GCN Circ. 13715), and shows a 
continuing decline in flux with a power-law decay slope of ~1.0 and 
no evidence for a jet break, consistent with Berger et al. (arXiv:1209:5423).  

We thank Dan Schwartz  and the entire Chandra staff for 
rapidly executing this observation.
