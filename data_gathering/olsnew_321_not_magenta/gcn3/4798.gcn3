The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 060219 at 22:49:50 UT 
on 19th February 2006, 105s after the BAT
trigger (A.Moretti et al. GCN 4788). No source is detected at the 
refined XRT position (A. Moretti GCN 4797). Analysing all the data from 
the first 7000s we obtain the following 5 sigma upper limits:

Filter        T_range(s)    Exp(s)  5sigUL(mag)
V            120-320           200         18.6  (the Finding Chart 
exposure)
V            105-5821         584        19.2
B            327-6639         631        19.8
U            652-6434        374         19.3
UVW1    628-6230        364        19.8
UVM2    604-6025        374        20.1
UVW2    556-5617        374        20.2
White      532-6704        257        19.7

Reported times are in seconds since BAT trigger.
These magnitudes are uncorrected for Galactic extinction;
E(B-V) = 0.032.
