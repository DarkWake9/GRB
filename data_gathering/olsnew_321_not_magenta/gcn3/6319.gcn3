P. Ferrero, S. Klose, D. A. Kann and S. Schulze (TLS Tautenburg)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration

The afterglow of GRB 070411 (Moretti et al., GCN 6267; Kann et al., GCN 6268)
was observed with VIMOS at  VLT/UT3 in imaging mode. A 150 second observation 
was obtained in the Rc filter at 3.1498 days after the GRB.
The afterglow is clearly detected. We measure Rc = 24.22 +/- 0.13 versus nearby comparison stars.

We thank D. Malesani for supplying the magnitudes of  the comparison stars and
the ESO staff for their excellent support.
