Jamie A. Kennea on behalf of the Swift Mission Operations Center reports:

The Swift Mission Operations Center (MOC), located near the Penn State 
University Park campus, is will move to a new office building on Tuesday 
August 26th starting at 8:00am Eastern Time (12:00 UT). This move is 
planned to be fully completed within 72 hours.

During the move, we will not accept any new TOO requests and Swift will 
not perform automated observations of any BAT triggers (GRBs, transients, 
etc.). A program of pre-planned observations will be performed by Swift 
during the period of the move, so science data will continue to be 
collected. However, until the MOC is operational, data taken during this 
period will not be delivered to the Swift Science Data Center, so there 
will be a delay in being able to obtain the processed data products from 
these observations.

At the end of the planned 72 hour move period, we expect all Swift 
capabilities to be fully restored. However, it is likely that most 
capabilities will return sooner than that. We will issue further notices 
to update on progress.
