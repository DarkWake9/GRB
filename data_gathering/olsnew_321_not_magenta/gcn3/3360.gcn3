At 23:22:21 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050505  (trigger #117504).   The BAT on-board
calculated location is RA, Dec 141.782, +30.255 (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including estimated
systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).  The BAT light curve
showed a multipeak structure with a duration of about 45 seconds.
The peak count rate measured by BAT was about 1500 counts/sec
in the 15 - 350 keV band, occurring at the trigger.

The Swift spacecraft did not make an immediate slew because of the
Earth observing constraint.
