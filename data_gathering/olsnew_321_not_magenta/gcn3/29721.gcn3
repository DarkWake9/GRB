Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210323A (trigger #1038247)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 29699).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 317.945, 25.352 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 11m 46.7s
   Dec(J2000) = +25d 21' 08.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.

The BAT lightcurve showed complex structure with a duration less than 2 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.12 +- 0.32 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.09 to T+1.26 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.46 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.9 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
