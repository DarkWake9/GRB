report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:43:14 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151205B (trigger=666378).  Swift could not slew immediately
to the burst due to an observing contraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 41.158, -43.481 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 44m 38s
   Dec(J2000) = -43d 28' 49"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
