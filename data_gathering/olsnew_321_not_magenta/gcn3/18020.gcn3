Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 150711A (trigger #648601)
(Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 18011).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 221.624, -35.464 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  14h 46m 29.7s
    Dec(J2000) = -35d 27' 49.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 32%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a cusp-shaped main peak with smaller
preceding and following peaks, each about 20 seconds long.  Emission was
detectable from T-40 to T+70.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.2 +- 14.2 sec (estimated
error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T-34.1 to T+70.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.79 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.98 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.8 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
