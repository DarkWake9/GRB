P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the XRT position of GRB 070429A (GCN ##6355,6363) with the
Gemini North telescope + GMOS, commencing at 2007 Apr 29.58 UT (12.3
hours after the GRB).  Observations consisted of 2x180 sec integrations
in Sloan i' and 4x180 sec in Sloan z'.

The source identified by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN #6361) is well
detected in these observations, though no statement as to its
variability can yet be made.  In addition, there is a fainter source
within the XRT error circle, at coordinates:

	19:50:48.77 -32:24:17.8 J2000

NIR imaging of this GRB has also been made, and will be reduced as
practical.  No further observations are planned.

We thank the Gemini North staff for helpful support of these quick
response observations.
