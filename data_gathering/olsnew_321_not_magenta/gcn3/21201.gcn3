SUBJECT: GRB 170522A: confirmation of the X-ray afterglow

K.L. Page and S.L. Gibson (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

Swift has performed further observations of the field of the
Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 170522A (Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 21127). An
additional 3.5 ks of data were collected between 987 ks and 999 ks after
the Fermi trigger.

Source 1, initially reported by Mingo et al. (GCN Circ. 21133), is no
longer detected to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.3e-3 ct s^-1. We therefore
conclude that this source is likely the X-ray afterglow of GRB 170522A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
