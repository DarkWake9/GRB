The long-duration GRB 170703A (Konus-Wind trigger time on
08:44:03.46 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 08:44:05.85 on 3 July 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all CGBM
instruments.  Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The light curve of the SGM shows two peaks.  The emission starts at T-2 sec,
peaks at T+1 sec (the first peak), T+ 7 sec (the second peak), and ends at T+20 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 26 +- 3 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
