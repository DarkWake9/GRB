The short GRB 190510A (Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization: The Fermi
GBM team, GCN Circ. 24449; IPN triangulation: Kozlova et al.,
GCN Circ. 24497; Konus-Wind observation: Kozlova et al., GCN Circ. 24533)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 10:19:15.735 UTC
on 10 May 2019. The burst signal was seen mainly by the SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked pulse which starts at
T+0.29 sec and ends at T+0.90 sec. The T90 and T50 durations measured by
the SGM data are 0.54 +- 0.09 sec and 0.29 +- 0.07 sec (40-1000 keV),
respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
