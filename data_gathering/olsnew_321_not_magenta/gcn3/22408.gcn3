report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:


"At 12:24:38.55 UT on February 10, 2018 Fermi-LAT detected
high-energy emission from GRB 180210A, which was also
detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 539958283/180210517)
(E. Bissaldi, GCN 22407).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 1.80, 18.35 (J2000 deg)

with an error radius of 0.18 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only).
This was 30 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger
and triggered an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
that is spatially correlated with the trigger with high significance.
The highest-energy photon is a 4 GeV event
which is observed 363 seconds after the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been approved for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is
Feraol F. Dirirsa (fdirirsa@uj.ac.za).


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed
to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration
between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific
institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."
