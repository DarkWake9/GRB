on behalf of the MOA Collaboration report :

We searched for an optical afterglow of GRB110318B (GCN 11799, R. Margutti
et al.)
starting from 15:40 UT on 2011 March 18 (13 minutes after the burst)
with the MOA-II 1.8m telescope at Mt.John observatory in New Zealand.
In a single image of a 60 sec exposure with a wideband Red filter (center
wavelength ~ 750nm and FWHM ~ 250nm), we did not find any object
within the error circle of the Swift XRT source position (GCN 11803, P.A.
Evans et al.).
A 3 sigma upper limit is set in the I magnitude at 20.7 mag.

This photometry was done by using the DoPhot and calibrated against
the USNO-B1.0 catalog stars, and not corrected for the Galactic extinction.
