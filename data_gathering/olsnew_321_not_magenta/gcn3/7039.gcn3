Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 071101 (trigger #295779)
(McBreen, et al., GCN Circ. 7030).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 48.179, 62.524 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 12m 42.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = 62d 31' 27" 
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 99%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at a low level
at ~T-20, then spiking at T+1 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.0 +- 1.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.9 to T+6.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.25 +- 0.58.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.6 +- 2.6 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.07 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
