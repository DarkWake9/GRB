Erik Kool (OKC), Daniel A. Goldstein (Caltech), and Igor Andreoni (Caltech) on behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

As part of the follow up effort described in Andreoni et al. (2019, GCN #24467) of the high-probability region of the LALInference skymap of gravitational wave source S190510g (LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration, GCN #24448) with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), we report the detection of an additional optical counterpart candidate, DS19qcso. The transient was detected ~2” offset to the N of the nucleus of its host galaxy through difference imaging using an automated pipeline, and appeared in g and r-band, but not in z-band. Coordinates and observed magnitudes (at jday 2458614.5) are as follows:

DS19qcso
Coordinates: 88.208631 -30.381382 (05:52:50.07 -30:22:53.0)
g mag: 21.57 (0.13)
r mag: 22.69 (0.21)
z mag: > 21.9

The host galaxy is identified as 2MASXi J0552500-302254, but no host redshift is available. From Pan-STARRS imaging, we measure the host galaxy to be 15’’ across. Postage stamp images of the candidate can be viewed at the following link:

We thank the CTIO staff, Steve Heathcote, Kathy Vivas, Tim Abbott, for facilitating these Target of Opportunity observations.
