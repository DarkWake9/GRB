I.A. Steele, A.S. Piascik, M.J.Darnley, C.M. Copperwheat (LJMU), M. M. Kasliwal (Caltech) and D.A. Perley (Dark Cosmology Centre, Copenhagen) on behalf of a lager collaboration.

We report spectroscopy of the iPTF counterparts iPTF17bv and iPTF17ck.  The data were obtained with the SPRAT spectrograph of the Liverpool Telescope, La Palma, on the night of 2017 January 09 with a resolution R=350 and a wavelength range of 400-800nm.

Our spectrum of iPTF17bv is noisy, but shows a possible Supernova Ic (post maximum) spectrum with z=0.039. The nearest host galaxy is 2MASX J08164468+4115597 with z=0.0385.

iPTF17ck shows a probable AGN/Galaxy spectrum with redshift z=0.121.  The nearest host is SDSS J074151.78+292114.1 (no redshift quoted).
