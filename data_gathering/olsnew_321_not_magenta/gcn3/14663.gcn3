P. Jenke (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:21:17.88 UT on May 15 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 130515A (trigger 390273680 / 130515056),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Malesani et al., GCN Circ. 14650).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle of the Fermi LAT boresight is 120 degrees from the Swift location.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a FRED-like shape
with a duration (T90) of about 0.26 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.256 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.90 +/- 0.08 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 450 +/- 100 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(10.4 +/- 0.5)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 22 +/- 2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
