A.J. Levan (Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (Leicester), C. Davis (JAC) report on 
behalf of a large collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 070724 in the K-band using UKIRT. Two 
epochs were obtained beginning at 13:11 UT and 14:02 UT. We clearly detect 
the object refered to by (Bloom GCNC 6658), and confirm that it is indeed 
a galaxy.

We find no evidence of variability within the galaxy between the two 
observations. No other objects are detected within the refined XRT error 
circles of Page & Ziaeepour (GCNC 6659) or Bloom & Butler (GCNC 6661).

Further observations are planned.
