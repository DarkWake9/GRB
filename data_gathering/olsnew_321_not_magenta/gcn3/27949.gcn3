X. Liu, Z.P. Zhu, S.Y. Fu, D. Xu, J. Zheng, A.Y. Zhou (NAOC) report:

We continued to observe the field of GRB 200613A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 
27926; Bissaldi et al., GCN 27930; Ohno et al., GCN 27931) using the 
Xinglong-2.16m telescope equipped with the BFOSC camera. Observations 
were carried out starting at 12:43:45 UT on 2020-06-15, and 5x300s 
R-band frames were obtained.

The previously reported afterglow (e.g., Kann et al., GCN 27935; Kennea 
et al., GCN 27936; Pozanenko et al., GCN 27937; Izzo et al., GCN 27939; 
Zhu et al., GCN 27943) is still clearly detected in our stacked image, 
with R = 20.0 +/- 0.1 mag (at Tmid-T0 = 2.311 days post-burst), 
calibrated with nearby Pan-STARRS1.

Further observations are planned.
