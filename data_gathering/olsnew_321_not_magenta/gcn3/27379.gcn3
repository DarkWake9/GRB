The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:57:12 UT on 13 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200313B (trigger 605789837.130132 / 200313456).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 202.2, Dec = 40.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 28m, 40d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 96.0 degrees.
