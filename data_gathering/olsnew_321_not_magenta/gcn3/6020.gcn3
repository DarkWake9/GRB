report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:12:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) issued
trigger 257213.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 266.265, -28.952 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 45m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -28d 57' 05"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed weak emission in 
15-25 keV band.  We note that this position is within 12 arcmin of the
galactic center, and the nature of the emission is consistent with
an X-ray burst.  The GCN system identified this position as X 1745.6-2901. 
However, it could be one of many X-ray bursters in the galactic center
region.  Swift did not slew to this source because it was sun-constrained. 
No further observations are planned.
