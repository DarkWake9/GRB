The long-duration GRB 170906A (Siegel et al., GCN Circ. 21821; Hamburg et al.,
GCN Circ. 21839; Tsvetkova et al., GCN Circ. 21859) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 00:43:05.59 on 6 September 2017.  The burst signal was
seen by the all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows a complex structure.  The emission starts at T0 sec
and the brightest pulse peaks at T+35 sec.  The entire emission ends at T+100 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 78.4 +- 1.9 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
