Announcement: Swift Data Publicly Available Starting April 5, 2005


April 5, 2005 marks the end of the 4.5 month launch and early orbit
check-out of the Swift gamma-ray burst observatory  and the beginning
of normal science operations. After this date, Swift data will be made
immediately available to the general public via the Swift Quick Look (QL)
Web sites. The data remain available on the QL sites for about one week,
and are then transferred to the three Swift archives.  More details of the
plan for how this will take place are available at:

http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/news/2005/archive_opening.html


The Swift Web site (http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov) contains links to download
the latest Swift data analysis software, calibration files (caldb), and
software user's guides for each of Swift's three instruments. The Swift
Web site also includes links to the Quick Look Web sites, the GCN archive,
the three Swift archives, Frequently Asked Questions, and a Feedback form
to submit problem reports and questions.
