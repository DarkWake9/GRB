C. Guidorzi, R. Martone (U. Ferrara), S. Kobayashi (LJMU), C.G. Mundell 
(U. Bath), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), I.A. Steele (LJMU), A. Cucchiara, 
D. Morris (U. of Virgin Islands) on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The LCO 2-m unit at Haleakala Observatory (Hawaii) observed the optical 
afterglow of Swift GRB 180624A (Gibson et al. GCN 22832) on June 25, 
from 13:02 to 13:14 UT (0.97 days after the GRB trigger time) with the 
SDSS r filter. The source is detected with a magnitude of 21.44 +- 0.10 
(AB). Compared with previous reports (Guidorzi et al. GCN 22839; Schady 
GCN 22840; Rossi et al. GCN 22845; Watson et al. GCN 22846) we confirm 
that the source's decay has significantly steepened from ~0.6 to ~1.0 
days, as first noted by Watson et al.
