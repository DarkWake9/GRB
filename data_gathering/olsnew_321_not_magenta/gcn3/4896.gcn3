S. Guziy (IAA-CSIC Granada), G. Gómez Velarde (IAC Tenerife)
and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

We have taken BVRI frames at the position of GRB 060319 (Ziaeepour
et al. GCNC 4885) with the IAC-80 telescope at Observatorio del
Teide (Canary Islands).  Images were obtained starting at 02:23 UT
(i.e. 1.45 hr after the onset of the burst).  We do not see any
optical source within the revised SWIFT/XRT position (Beardmore
et al. GCNC 4895) down to R = 21. In particular, we do not see
any counterpart at this time to the MASTER source reported by
Lipunov et al. (GCNC 4892) in agreement with D'Avanzo et al.
(GCNC 4893).
