We observed the field of GRB 200613A (Bissaldi and Lesage, GCN #27930; Ohno et al., GCN #27931) with the IO:O camera mounted on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain. Observations started on June 13th at 22:20:26 UT (0.701 days after the GRB trigger) and we obtained a series of 60s images in the r filter.

We clearly detect in the stacked image the optical afterglow at the position reported by the Swift-XRT (Kennea et al., GCN #27936) and by OAJ, Kitab and AbAO (Kann et al., GCN #27935, GCN #27938; Pozanenko et al., GCN #27937). We measure a preliminary AB magnitude for the afterglow of r = 19.45 +- 0.20 mag (t_mid = 0.705 d) calibrated against Pan-STARRS catalogue stars.
