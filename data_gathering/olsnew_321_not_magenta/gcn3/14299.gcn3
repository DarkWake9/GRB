collaboration, report:

“Following the detection of GRB 130313A by Swift (Gompertz et al. GCNC
14293), both the 0.6m BOOTES-3/YA and BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescopes in
Lijiang (China) and Blenheim (New Zealand) responded automatically to the
trigger alert. Due to poor atmospheric/environmental conditions in both
places, not deep limits were obtained: R > 15 (at BOOTES-3) with an
unfiltered 60 second exposure beginning at 16h35m29s UT (27 minutes after
the burst) and R > 18.5 (at BOOTES-4) beginning at 18h12m39s UT (2 hours
after the burst). In addition to these late limits, the CASANDRA-3
wide-field system at BOOTES-3 took unfiltered images (36 seconds exposure
each) beginning at 16h06m44s UT (87 seconds before the burst), 16h07m40s
UT (31 seconds before the burst) and 16h08h36s UT (25 seconds after the
burst). No credible transient is observed down to a limiting magnitude of
R > 8.5.”
