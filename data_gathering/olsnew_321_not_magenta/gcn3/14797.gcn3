H. Kirbiyik (TUG) report on behalf of a larger collaboration

We observed the field of Swift  GRB 130606A (Ukwatta et al. GCN#14781)
with  the  1.0 meter  T100  telescope  (TUBITAK National  Observatory,
Antalya - Turkey),  starting June, 6,  22:43:53 UT (~ 1.6 hours after
the trigger). Observations were carried out in the R filter under moderate
weather conditions. We detected a new source in 300 s R band
image at a position that is consistent with Xu et al. GCN#14783
Using USNO-B1 star USNO-B1 1198-0251348  (RA=  16:37:32.14 , Dec=
+29:51:58.15 ) in the field, the magnitude of the OT were estimated as 20.6
+/-0.2.

Further observations using the same filter are ongoing.

We are grateful to the TUBITAK National Observatory staff for promptly
scheduling the observations and their technical support.
