S. Bradley Cenko, Alicia M. Soderberg, Eran Ofek (Caltech) and Derek B.
Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 051227 (Barbier et al., GCN 4397;
Hullinger et al., GCN 4400; Barthelmy et al., GCN 4401; Sakamoto et al.,
GCN 4403) with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations
consisted of 30 x 180 s images in the Kron R filter taken at a mean epoch
of approximately UT 28 December 05:50 (11.7 hours after the burst).

In a coaddition of all our images, we find no sources inside the revised
XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN 4402) to a limiting magnitude of R
> 22.5 (calculated with respect to several nearby sources in the Guide
Star Catalog).  In particular we note the candidate afterglow/host
proposed by Malesani et al. (GCN 4404) is not detected in our images to
the above limit.
