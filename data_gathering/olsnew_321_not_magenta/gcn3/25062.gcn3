B. Mailyan (UAH)  and J. Wood (NASA) report on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 190712A (GCN 25057),
at the event time Fermi-GBM was observing the reported neutrino location at:

RA: 76.46 (+5.09 -6.83 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 13.06 (+4.48 -3.44 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000


There was no Fermi-GBM onboard trigger around the event time of the
neutrino candidate.

The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive, coherent search for GRB-like
signals, was run from +/-30 s around the neutrino candidate time. From this
search, no significant signal was found related to IceCube-190712A.

We set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission. Using the
representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates
(arXiv:1612.02395), we report the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over
10-1000 keV (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):
