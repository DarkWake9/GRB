V.Rumyantsev (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have observed the afterglow field (GCN 1731) of  GRB021211 (HETE 2493;
GCN 1734) with 0.64-m Richter-Slefogt telescope of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. 
Several unfiltered images with exposure 30-180 sec were taken on Dec. 11 
20:39 - 22:46(UT). 
We do not find OT at the position reported by D.Fox, et al (GCN 1731).

The limiting magnitude (3 sigma) for two images are

20:39 (UT)  - 18
22:39 (UT)  - 19.5

Further analysis of combined image is underway.
