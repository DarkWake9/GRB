The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:24:18 UT on 2 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200702A (trigger 615417863.9672 / 200702892).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 300.4, Dec = -57.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 01m, -57d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 21.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 51.0 degrees.
