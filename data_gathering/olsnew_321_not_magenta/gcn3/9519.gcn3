A. Carraminana (INAOE), C. Alvarez Ochoa (UNACh)
and G. Miramon (OAGH-INAOE) report:

We clearly detected the optical counterpart of GRB 090618 (GCN 9512)
with the 2.1m telescope of the Observatorio Astrofisico
Guillermo Haro at Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. Observations started
at 08:43 UT, 14 minutes after the BAT trigger and continued
until dawn. Observations were made under non photometric conditions.

We measured a lineal faddening of the burst compared to
a reference star of amplitude 0.5 magnitudes between t=870s
to 1600s. A non calibrated graph is available at

Spectroscopic data were also obtained and are under analysis.
