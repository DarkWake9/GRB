The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2022-06-27 at 17:51:54.28 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_BRONZE alert stream. The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 3.454 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136775_22443736.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2022-06-27
Time:  17:51:54.28 UT
RA: 165.59 (+2.83, -5.61 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 5.30 (+1.76, -1.33 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There is one Fermi 4FGL catalog source in the 90% uncertainty region of the event: 4FGL J1050.1+0432 (RA: 162.55 deg, Dec: 4.54 deg J2000, 3.13 deg away from the best-fit event position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
