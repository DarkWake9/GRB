L. Piro (BeppoSAX Mission Scientist) reports:

The observation of the X-ray afterglow of GRB000926 reported by Piro et
al. in BeppoSAX mails n. 00/21, 00/22, 00/23 and GCN n. 812 , 832, 833 was
performed as a BeppoSAX Project TOO (i.e. the equivalent of Director
Discretionary Time) and as such falls under the responsibility of the
BeppoSAX Mission Scientist. These data are usually property of the
BeppoSAX team.

However, taking into account the considerable interest of this GRB, we
have decided to make these data immediately public to the scientific
community.


Reduced data sets (image, spectrum, light curve) and cleaned photon list
can be accessed through the BeppoSAX archive at:
