A. N. Morgan (UC Berkeley) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 130327A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14331) with the
1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations began at
2013-Mar-27 02h21m22s UT, ~33.8 minutes after the Swift trigger.  In
mosaics (effective exposure time of ~25 m) taken simultaneously in the J,
H, and Ks filters, we marginally detect a source in the J band within the
XRT error circle (Ukwatta et al., GCN 14331).  Given the minor significance
of the detection in only a single filter, deeper observations are
encouraged to confirm if this possible source is indeed the afterglow of
GRB 130327A.
