D. M. Palmer (LANL) reports on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

After analysis of the complete data set, we have determined that Swift/BAT 
Trigger #931384 (tentatively labelled GRB 191025A in GCN #26072)
is a statistical fluctuation (noise peak) in the image plane and 
not an astrophysical source.
