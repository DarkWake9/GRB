S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), V. D'Elia (ASDC),
L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) and T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 23:38:50 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located  H1745-203 (trigger=631946).  Swift will slew to the source at ~00:30 UT. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 267.227, -20.379, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 48m 54s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 22' 42"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This was a 22-min image trigger, and as such
there will be nothing visible in the real-time TDRSS light curve. 

This AT will be cancelled at about 02:30 UT. 

BAT has seen this source rising in flux since Feb 17.
