K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the NEAR and Konus Wind GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 26072 s UT.
As observed by Ulysses, its duration was ~30 s, its 25-100 keV
fluence was ~9.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and its peak flux over 0.25
s was ~1.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  We have triangulated it to an
~60 sq. arcmin. error box whose preliminary, 3 sigma coordinates
are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 11 h 20 m 10.97 s     26 o 16 '  41.19 "  (CENTER)
 11 h 20 m 23.84 s     26 o 16 '   7.00 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 18 m 55.98 s     26 o 29 '  28.37 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 21 m 24.90 s     26 o  3 '  55.26 "  (CORNER)
 11 h 19 m 58.09 s     26 o 17 '  15.33 "  (CORNER)

This localization can be improved.
