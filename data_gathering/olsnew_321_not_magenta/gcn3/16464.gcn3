V. D'Elia (ASDC), L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We report further Swift-XRT observations of GRB 140623A (A. von  
Kienlin, GCN Circ 16450; Bhalerao et al., GCN Circ. 16442). A new  
exposure of 5 ks has been secured 285 ks after the Fermi/GBM  
detection. The X-ray counterpart detected by D'Elia et al. (GCN Circ.  
16451) is no longer present down to a three sigma upper limit of  
2.2E-3 cts/s.

We thus conclude that the source reported in D'Elia et al. (GCN Circ.  
16451) is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 140623A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
