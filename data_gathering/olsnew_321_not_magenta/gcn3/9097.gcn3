Sheila McBreen (UCD/MPE)  reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:32:42.13 UT on 03 April 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090403 (trigger 260436764 / 090403314).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 65.2, DEC = +47.1 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 04 h 21 m, +47 d 06'), with an uncertainty
of 8.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 42 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one pulse
with a duration of about 16 s. Since the source is weak,
the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
