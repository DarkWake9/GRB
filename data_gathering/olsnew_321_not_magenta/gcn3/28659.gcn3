report: 

On October 15, 2020, the MAGIC telescopes observed GRB 201015A following the Swift-BAT trigger (D’Elia et al., GCN 28632).
MAGIC started observations under good conditions about 40 seconds after the initial Swift trigger, revealing a hint of signal
with significance >3 sigma in the very high energy band. Refined off-line analyses of the data are ongoing.

Further MAGIC observations on GRB 201015A are planned in the coming night. We strongly encourage follow-up
observations by other instruments at all wavelengths.

The MAGIC point of contact for this burst is O. Blanch (blanch@ifae.es). Burst Advocate for this burst is
M. Gaug (Markus.Gaug@uab.cat)

MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
located at the Observatory Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island
La Palma, Spain, and designed to perform gamma-ray astronomy in the energy
range from 50 GeV to greater than 50 TeV.
