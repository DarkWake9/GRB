K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf of
the Konus Wind and NEAR GRB teams, E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on
behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team, and F. Frontera, C. Guidorzi, and
E. Montanari, on behalf of the BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses, Konus Wind, NEAR, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed this
burst at 59547 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses, the duration was
~20 s, the 25 - 100 keV fluence was ~ 5.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2, and
the peak flux over 0.5 s was ~3.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 s.  We have
triangulated this burst to an ~30 sq. arcmin. error box whose
preliminary, 3 sigma coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  2 h 22 m 27.23 s    -17 o 52 '  16.34 "  (CENTER)
  2 h 22 m 20.59 s    -17 o 52 '  55.53 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 22 m 52.04 s    -17 o 41 '   7.88 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 22 m  2.35 s    -18 o  3 '  25.48 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 22 m 33.87 s    -17 o 51 '  37.14 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined.
