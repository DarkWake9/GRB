S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, I.Vovk (ISDC, Versoix), 
D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS 
Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 10 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 06:56:12 UT of December 12.
Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 177.8217  deg
DEC.=  78.0257  deg

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst has a peak flux of 0,4 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration 
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 8e-8 erg/cm2.

This burst has also been detected by Swift (Grupe et al. GCN Circ.14064).

Due to the significance of the detection below the high confidence 
threshold, only an Alert Packet of WEAK type was distributed by IBAS in 
real time (Packet n. 6720).
