T. Kawabata (BAO), T. Morishita (OPU), T. Hatayama (BAO visitor),
Y. Urata (Titech / RIKEN), and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu U) report:

  "A full analysis of Bisei Astronomical Observatory (BAO) images (GCN
1489) of GRB 020812 was performed.  The entire error box was imaged
five times with 12 no-filter pointing observations (60 seconds
exposure each) by 1.01-m BAO telescope.

  The limiting magnitude for each images is mag 19.1 (3 sigma,
compared with USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes), although some images are poor
because of thin clouds.  

  Comparison with DSS II red images, no new object was detected down
to the limiting magnitude.  Also, the comparison between our 
observations, no notable variable object was detected."
