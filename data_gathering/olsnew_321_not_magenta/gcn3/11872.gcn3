William C. Keel, Erin Darnell (U Alabama), Adria C. Updike (NASA/GSFC), D.
Alexander Kann (TLS Tautenburg), and Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University) report:

We observed the field of GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451 (Cummings et
al., GCN 11823) on April 1 at 11:50 UT (3.96 days after the trigger) for
20 minutes in the R band with the SARA North telescope at KPNO.  At the
location of the optical counterpart (Cenko et al., GCN 11827; Volnova et
al., GCN 11837) we marginally detect the transient at R = 21.7 +/- 0.3 as
compared to the USNO B1.0 catalog and the comparison star given by
Leloudas et al. (GCN 11844), in good agreement with the earlier
observations of Kelemen et al. (GCN 11867).

This GCN resulted from a collaboration initiated by the BAUTforum.
