Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201014A (trigger #1000255)
(Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 28623; D'Elia et al., GCN Circ 28626).
The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 20.834, 27.722 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 23m 20.2s
   Dec(J2000) = +27d 43' 19.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak pulse that starts at ~T+30 s
and ends at ~T+70 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 36.2 +- 8.1 sec (estimated
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+30.16 to T+69.84 sec is best fit by
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 2.55 +- 0.37.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.1 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from
T+59.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

The ground analysis shows an improved image significance
of 8.2 sigma in 15-350 keV. Also, the temporal and spectral
characteristics are consistent with those of a long GRB.
Therefore, the BAT ground analysis confirms that this is a GRB,
consistent with the conclusion reported in D'Elia et al., GCN Circ 28626.
