report on behalf of Nayuta team:

We performed low resolution ( R ~ 500) optical spectroscopic observations
of a source on the position of GRB 130427A (Masell et al., GCNC 14448)
with MALLS attached to the Nayuta 2-m telescope at the Nishi-Harima
Astronomical Observatory.

The observations were conducted from 2013-04-27 12:48 UT to 2013-04-27
22 : 09 UT (from ~5.1 h to ~ 5.4 h after the burst).

The resulting spectrum ( S/N ~ 5) shows a feature less continuum light
without any emission nor absorption line features in the wavelength
range between 450 nm and 680 nm.
