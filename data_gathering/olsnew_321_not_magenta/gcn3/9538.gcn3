Atish Kamble (University of Amsterdam), A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) 
and Ralph Wijiers (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf of 
a larger collaboration :

"We observed the position of GRB 090618 afterglow at 4.9 GHz 
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope between
June 19.78 to 20.30 UT i.e. 1.7 days after the burst (GCN 9512, 
GCN 9532, GCN 9533). The radio afterglow was clearly detected 
and its measured flux density is about 501 +/- 47 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and carrying out 
these observations."
