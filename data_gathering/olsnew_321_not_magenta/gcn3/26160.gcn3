J.M. Burgess and J. Greiner (both MPE Garching) report:

We note that the last two Fermi/GBM triggers (GRB 191104B: Fermi team at MSFC 
et al., GCN #26154;  GRB 191104C: Kunzweiler et al., GCN #26158) were 
misclassified as GRBs, but due to their short duration, soft spectrum and 
positional coincidence are likely outbursts from SGR 1935+2154 (which also 
triggered Swift earlier today (Ambrosi et al., GCN 26153).
