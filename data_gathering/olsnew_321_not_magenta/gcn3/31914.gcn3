The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:51:58 UT on 18 Apr 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220418A (trigger 671989923.878466 / 220418661).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 334.3, Dec = 62.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 17m, 62d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 18.0 degrees.
