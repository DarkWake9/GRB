SUBJECT: GRB990123: Late-time HST/STIS observations of the host

A. Fruchter (STScI) reports for the HST GRB collaboration:

It has come to our attention that the web page reported in our last circular,
GCN 712, did not load properly for outside users.  The GRB 990123 page that
they saw was unchanged from last year.

We have corrected this problem.  Readers wishing to see the light curve of
the OT, or the late-time imageing of the host, can either click on the
animated gif of the decline of GRB 990123 at 

http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB

or go directly to

http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/990123 .

We have now also included a color image of the host and the wider field about 
GRB 990123 created using the both the open (50CCD) images (see GCN 712)
and the more recent long pass STIS data (GCN 715).
