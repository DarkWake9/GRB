M. Jelinek (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (UPV-EY, IAA-CSIC), A. J.
Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  S. Mottola (DLR), S. Hellmich (DLR), R.
Fernández-Muñoz (EELM-CSIC) and V. F. Muñoz-Martínez (UMA), on behalf of a
larger collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB 130606 by Swift (Ukwatta et al. GCNC
14781), follow-up observation were taken with the 0.6m TELMA telescope at
the BOOTES-2 station (Málaga) and with the 1.23m CAHA telescope at the
German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory, starting 21m postburst. At the edge
of the Swift/XRT error box we identify an optical source not present in
the DSS-2 with a magnitude of R about 18.5 which we identify as the
optical afterglow."
