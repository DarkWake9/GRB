We observed three pointings designed to cover the majority of the skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger G184098 with the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope.  The observations each cover roughly 30deg x 30deg (FWHM) centered at:

04:16:48 -63:06:00 2015-09-17 20:44 UT
08:08:00 -72:00:00 2015-09-18 00:36 UT
08:52:24 +01:54:00 2015-09-18 00:52 UT

The observations are at a center frequency of 118 MHz, with a 30 MHz bandwidth.  Each field was observed for a total of 12min, with 2s integrations and 10 kHz frequency resolution.  These fields will be revisited starting on 2015-09-26.  Analysis is ongoing.
