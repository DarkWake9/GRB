The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 20/11/30 at 20:21:46.48 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_GOLD alert stream.  The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 1.322 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/134751_31476488.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 20/11/30
Time:  20:21:46.48 UT
RA: 30.54 (+ 1.13 - 1.31 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -12.10 (+ 1.15 - 1.13 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There is one Fermi-LAT 4FGL source inside the 90% localization region, 4FGL J0206.4-1151, located at RA 31.6 deg and Dec -11.86 deg (J2000), at a distance of 1.07 degrees from the best-fit location.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
