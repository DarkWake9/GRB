V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), V. Kumar (IUCAA), D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), A. R. Rao (TIFR), S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the Astrosat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of Astrosat data showed the CZTI detection of a very bright GRB160802A (Fermi-GBM detection: E. Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 19754).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows a complex structure, with the strongest peak at 06:13:30.90 UT, 0.27
seconds after Fermi Trigger at 06:13:29.63 UT and a peak count rate of 4270.0 counts/sec above the background (four quadrants summed together), with a total
of 91636 counts. The local mean background count rate was 310.0 counts/sec. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 16.8 secs.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb . CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of
institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
