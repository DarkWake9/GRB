K.L. Page (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 3.4 ks of XRT data for the Swift/BAT ground-detected
burst: GRB 140716A (Cummings, GCN Circ 16596; Cummings et al., GCN Circ.
16598), from 34.1 to 56.8 ks after the first of the ground-detected BAT
triggers. This burst was also detected by Fermi-GBM (Jenke & Yu, GCN Circ.
16599). The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. We detect an
uncatalogued X-ray source with a mean count rate of 0.024 (+/- 0.003)
count s^-1, at a position of RA, Dec = 108.1731, -60.1757, which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000):   07h 12m 41.53s
Dec (J2000): -60d 10' 32.7"

with an uncertainty of 4.7" (radius, 90% confidence). This is 1.95' from
the BAT position, a little outside the 1.5' 90% BAT error circle. We
cannot determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
