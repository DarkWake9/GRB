V. D’Elia (SSDC) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Following the Chandra late time detection (Gompertz et al., GCN Circ. 28822) of GRB 201015A (D’Elia et al., GCN Circ. 28632), Swift performed a ToO observation of its X-ray afterglow. 13 ks of data were acquired between 3 and 6 November, i.e., 18-21 days after the trigger. Consistent with the prediction reported by Gompertz et al., XRT detected the afterglow at a level of (7+/-3)E-4 cts/s.

This is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
