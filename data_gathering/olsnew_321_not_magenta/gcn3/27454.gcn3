Analysis of AstroSat LAXPC data showed the detection of a long
GRB 200326B. The light curve showed a double peak profile
triggered at T0 = 21h 13m 52s UT on 26 Mar 2020, with T90=10 sec
for the first peak followed by a second smaller peak of similar
duration about 10 s later. The measured peak count rate above the
background associated with the burst is 158 +/- 24 cts/s in
LAXPC10 and 171 +/- 20 cts/s in LAXPC20 at T0+3 sec. The total
counts in the first peak are 542 +/- 71 cts in LAXPC10 and
773 +/- 54 in LAXPC20.

Both LAXPC instruments (LAXPC10 and LAXPC20) have registered this
burst profile in the light curve. For LAXPC20 the nominal energy
range is 3-100 keV, but due to lower gain in LAXPC10 the energy
range is about 30-400 keV.

The background subtracted light curve with 1 sec time-bin is
available at the web-site:

LAXPC was built by TIFR in collaboration with the Indian Space
Research Organisation. The Indian Space Research Organisation
funded, managed and facilitated the project.
