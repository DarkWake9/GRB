The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:04:32 UT on 11 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200711A (trigger 616158277.930672 / 200711461).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 287.1, Dec = 1.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 08m, 1d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 79.0 degrees.
