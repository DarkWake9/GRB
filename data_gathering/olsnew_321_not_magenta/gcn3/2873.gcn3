TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2873
SUBJECT: GRB 041218: Optical Observation

J. P. Halpern and S. Tuttle (Columbia U.) report for the erstwhile
MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We observed INTEGRAL GRB 041218 (Mereghetti et al. GCN #2858) in the
R-band using the MDM 1.3m telescope under conditions of poor seeing.
A total of 50 minutes of exposure centered at Dec. 19, 05:03 UT, or
13.3 hours after the burst showed a faint object of R = 22.15 +/- 0.25
at the position of the OT reported by Torii et al (GCN #2860),
Gorosabel et al. (GCN #2861), and Greco et al. (GCN #2863). 

We use for comparison the USNO B1.0 star 1613-0027268 located at
R.A. = 01h39m04s.17, Decl. = +71o21'06".0 (J2000) for which
Henden (GCN #2869) gives Rc = 16.65.

We note that there is considerable Galactic extinction in this direction, 
E(B-V)=0.63 corresponding to A_R=1.67 (Schlegel et al. 1998)."
