V. D’Elia (ASDC) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the Fermi/LAT-detected burst GRB 170127C (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ 20543, Moretti et al., GCN Circ 20544)  in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 5 ks, distributed over 7 tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location was 1.4 ks. The data were collected between T0+61.2 and T0+77.4 ks and are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

No new source is detected in the XRT field of view, at a count rate limit in the range 0.005-0.01 cts/s.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the tiled XRT observations, including a position-specific upper limit calculator, areavailable at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00063.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
