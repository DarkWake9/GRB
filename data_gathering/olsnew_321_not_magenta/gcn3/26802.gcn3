On 20/01/17 at 11:08:29.69UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a 
moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was 
selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The average 
astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has 
an estimated false alarm rate of 1.93events per year due to atmospheric 
backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the 
time of detection.


After the initial automated alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/133634_1410505.amon), more

sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with 
the direction refined to:


Date: 20/01/17

Time: 11:08:29.69UT

RA: 116.24 (+0.71-1.24  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

Dec: 29.14  (+0.90-0.78  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000


We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help 
identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.


There are no 4FGL sources inside the 90% localization region. The 
closest source is 4FGL J0746.5+2730 located at RA 116.63 deg and dec 
27.52 deg  (at a distance of 1.66 degrees from the best-fit location).


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
