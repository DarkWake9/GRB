Seong-Kook Lee, Myungshin Im (SNU), and Y. Urata (NCU) report:

We observed the location of GRB 121209A with the ARC Camera mounted on the
1.0m
Telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical Astronomy Observatory (LOAO) on 2012 Dec
10,
09:06 UT.
We obtained a series of 300 seconds exposure images in I-band and Z-band
under 4" seeing.

We do not detect any source in both bands.
Calibrated to SDSS stars, we derive 3-sigma detection limit (in AB system)
in each band,

I > 20.9
Z > 19.6

We thank KASI staff for their support.
