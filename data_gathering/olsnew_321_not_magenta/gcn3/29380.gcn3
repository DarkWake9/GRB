The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:10:31 UT on 2 Feb 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210202A (trigger 633989436.299376 / 210202841).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 232.2, Dec = -40.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 28m, -40d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 45.0 degrees.
