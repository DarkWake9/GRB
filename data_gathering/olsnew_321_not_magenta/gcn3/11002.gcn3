A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 05:42:22.00 UT on 27 July 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100727A (trigger 301902143 / 100727238),
which was also detected by the SWIFT-BAT (Morris et al. 2010, GCN 10998)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 95.1 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 24 +/- 3 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.144 s to T0+12.288 s is 
best fit by a simple power law function with 
index -1.71 +/- 0.04 (Castor C-STAT 785 for 473 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(2.03 +/- 0.14)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0-4.096 s in the 8-1000 keV band 
is  1.6 +/- 0.2  ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
