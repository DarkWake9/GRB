D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 04:19:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 061019 (trigger=234516).  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA,Dec 91.617, +29.573 {06h 06m 28s, +29d 34' 21"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a 
multiple-peaked light curve with a duration of at least 20 sec. 
The peak count rate was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~2 sec 
after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft will not be 
able to slew to the BAT position until T+45 minutes, and so there 
are no immediate XRT or UVOT data products to analyze.
