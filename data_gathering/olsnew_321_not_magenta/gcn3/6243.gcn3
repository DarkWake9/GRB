S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind and Konus-A teams report:

The long GRB 070402 (Hurley et al., GCN 6241, 6242),
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=56914.653 s UT (15:48:34.653).
Konus-A observed this GRB in the waiting mode.

The Konus-Wind light curve shows a single multipeaked pulse
with a total duration of ~12 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 1.17(-0.22, +0.06)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+3.184 s
3.18(-0.72, +0.42)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the most intense part integrated from T0 to T0+8.192 s
(this interval comprises ~90% of the burst total counts)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 3 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 0.92(-0.12, +0.11)
and Ep = 325(-40, +52) keV (chi2 = 60/68 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
