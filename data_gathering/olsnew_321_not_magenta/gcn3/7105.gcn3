J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), on behalf of the Gemini GRB collaboration,  
reports:

"Imaging observations of the field of GRB 071117 (Ukwatta et al., GCN  
7098) were autonomously queued for Gemini South as part of the  
program GS-2007B-Q-2  (PI = H.-W. Chen). Starting at 2007 Nov 18  
00h24m UT, we obtained 5 x 180 sec images in r-band. Within the  
revised XRT error circle (Guidorzi et al. GCN 7103) we find one  
source (s1) at position:

   s1:   ra=  22:20:10.63  dec = -63:26:33.7  (J2000)

The uncertainty is 350 mas in each coordinate (relative to USNO  
B1.0). This source, s1, is roughly R=23.3 mag at the time of  
observation (based upon the USNO B.10 catalog magnitude of the source  
at 22:20:13.33 -63:26:32.9).  There is another source straddling the  
90% error circle, embedded in an apparent faint extension to the  
southeast at:

   s2:   ra= 22:20:10.42  dec = -63:26:35.5 (J2000)

Further observations will be required to determine if either of these  
sources are variable."
