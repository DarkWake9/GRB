The long soft GRB 200528A (Swift detection: Ambrosi et al.,
GCN Circ. 27832, Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 27839;
Fermi GBM observation: Fletcher and Meegan, GCN Circ. 27841;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/200528A.gcn3)
triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 10:27:27.087 UTC
on 28 May 2020. The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts at
T-4.5 sec, peaks at T+30.8 sec and ends at T+35.1 sec. The T90 and T50
durations measured by the SGM data are 36.6 +- 3.2 sec and 27.9 +- 4.0 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
