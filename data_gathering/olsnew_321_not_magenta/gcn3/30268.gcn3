K. Pellegrin, S. Anandagoda, and D. Hartmann report:

We observed the field of GRB 210619B detected by Swift BAT (Dâ€™Avanzo et al.,
GCN #30261), Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov et al., GCN #30262), GECAM (Zhao et
al., GCN #30264), iTelescope (Kong, GCN #30265), and Ondrejov D50 (M.
Jelinek et al., GCN #30263) using the SARA 0.9m optical telescope located
at Kitt Peak, AZ, USA, equipped with the Alta-E6-1105 camera.

Observation started at 05:19:14 UTC on 2021-06-20 and ended at 06:13:23 UTC
on 2021-06-20. We obtained a series of 60s exposure frames in the
Johnson-Cousins R filter. We detect the optical afterglow of GRB 210619B at
the enhanced Swift-XRT position (Beardmore, et al., GCN #30267).

The estimated magnitude of the GRB afterglow was found by stacking 20
images of 60s each in the Johnson-Cousins R band filter. The GRB was
visible in each of the stacked images.

Photometry is done based on the PanSTARRS catalog.

The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) consortium
operates three telescopes: the 0.9-m SARA-KP at Kitt Peak in Arizona, and
the 0.6-m SARA-CT at Cerro Tololo in Chile, and the 1.0-m SARA-RM (formerly
the JKT) telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary
Islands. For more information see: Keel et al. (2016):
