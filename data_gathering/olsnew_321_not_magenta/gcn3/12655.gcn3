Kenshi Yanagisawa, Daisuke Kuroda, Yasuhiro Shimizu, Kiichi Okita
(OAO/NAOJ), Michitoshi Yoshida (Hiroshima-U), Kouji Ohta(Kyoto-U),
and Nobuyuki Kawai(Tokyo Tech.) report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB111210A (Siegel et al, GCN12650, Stamatikos
et al, GCN12651) in J-band with a wide-field NIR camera at Okayama
Astrophysical Observatory (Japan). The camera has an effective aperture
of 0.91m.

Observations started from 17:59 UT on 10th December, 3.37 hours after
the BAT trigger, to 19:35 UT.  The total exposure of 73 min was
successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within the
enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCNC 12652) down to limiting
magnitude of  J=16.0 (Vega, S/N=10). The photometric calibration was
made against 2MASS field stars.
