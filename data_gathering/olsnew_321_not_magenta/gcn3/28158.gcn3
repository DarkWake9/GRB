The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:06:18 UT on 24 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200724A (trigger 617259983.984672 / 200724213).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 121.7, Dec = -10.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 06m, -10d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.
