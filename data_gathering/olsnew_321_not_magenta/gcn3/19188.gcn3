Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160314A (trigger #679120)
(D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 19182).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 112.766, 17.024 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  07h 31m 03.9s
  Dec(J2000) = +17d 01' 24.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that starts
at ~ T0, peaks at ~ T+1 s, and ends at ~ T+9 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 8.73 +- 1.52 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.04 to T+9.31 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.53 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.12 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
