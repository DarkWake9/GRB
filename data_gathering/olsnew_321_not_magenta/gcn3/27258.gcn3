SUBJECT : LIGO/Virgo S200213t: No significant EM counterparts identified
from continued GECKO observation of host galaxy candidates

Choi (SNU), Shuhrat A. Ehgamberdiev (UBAI), Otabek Burkhonov (UBAI), Davron
Mirzaqulov (UBAI), Hyung Mok Lee (KASI), on behalf of GECKO team

We performed follow-up observation for host galaxy candidates (Paek et al.
GCN #27067, GCN #27119) continuously using AZT-22 1.5m telescope at
Maidanak Astronomical Observatory in Uzbekistan in the initial and updated
localiztion area of S200213t (Singer et al, GCN #27042) and overlapped
neutrino detection area (Hussain et al, GCN #27043).

No significant EM counterpart candidates were found in the stacked images.
Single images were taken in B and R-band of 180 or 300 seconds. Observation
results are listed below. DEPTH is 5-sigma detection limit for point source
in AB magnitude. Flux calibration is conducted using APASS DR9 catalog.
