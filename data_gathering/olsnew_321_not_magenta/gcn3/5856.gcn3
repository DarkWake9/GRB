SUBJECT: GRB 061126: Swift/UVOT Afterglow Detection

FROM:    Daniel E. Vanden Berk at PSU/Swift  <danvb@astro.psu.edu>

D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU), B. Sbarufatti (INAF-IASFPA), and S. D. Barthelmy
(GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650
nm) filter starting 1605 seconds after the BAT trigger.  Because of an
Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly to the BAT
position.  There is a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available
2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =  05:46:24.46 =  86.6019
  DEC(J2000) = +64:12:38.5  =  64.2107
with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5 arc sec. This position is 83.0
arc sec. from the center of the BAT error circle, and 2.5 arc sec. from
the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is 18.6 with
a 1-sigma error of about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.18.
