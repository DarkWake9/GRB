A. Breeveld (MSSL/UCL) and J. Racusin (PSU) report on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began taking data on 2006-09-01 at 22:33:37 on the field 
of the INTEGRAL burst 060901 about 4 hours after the burst (Mereghetti 
et al., GCN 5491) .  At the position of the XRT error circle (Racusin 
et al., GCN 5494) there are no new sources, although there is a 
catalogued source. There is no source seen either at the position of 
the new source in J band reported by Cobb et al. (GCN 5495). In the 
summed UVOT images we obtain the following 3 sigma upper limits:
