We observed the field of GRB 141005A detected by Swift (trigger #614415; 
D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 16882) with the iTelescope.Net (http://www.itelescope.net) 
T21 (0.43 m Planewave) telescope located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory 
(NM, USA).  

60 images of 20 sec exposures and 20 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the 
R filter starting from October 5 05:27:55 (UT) about 15 minutes after the trigger 
and stopped on October 5 06:33:49 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow 
both in the individual images and the stacked image at the enhanced X-ray 
afterglow position (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 16888).  The estimated five sigma 
upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 2400 sec) is ~18.4 using 
the USNO-B1 catalog.
