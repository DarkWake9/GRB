The long GRB 211227A (Swift detection and refined analysis:

MAXI/GSC detection: Tominaga et al., GCN Circ. 31319;
https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/211227A.gcn3) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 23:32:07.476 UTC on 27 December 2021.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script, the GCN
notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked structure which starts
at T-0.6 sec and ends at T+77.2 sec.
The T90 and T50 durations measured by the SGM data are 64.5 +- 10.3 sec and
22.0 +- 2.0 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
