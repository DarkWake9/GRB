The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 06:16:25 UT on 20 Jun 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220620B (trigger 677398590.943632 / 220620261).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 326.9, Dec = -44.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 47m, -44d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 68.0 degrees.
