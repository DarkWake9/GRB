The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 20:45:59 UT on 21 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200421A (trigger 609194764.72639 / 200421865).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 164.0, Dec = 63.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 56m, 63d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 14.0 degrees.
