The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:38:50 UT on 20 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201120A (trigger 627557935 / 201120402).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 277.7, Dec = 19.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 18h 31m, +19d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 97.0 degrees.
