We observed the field of GRB 160917A (Racusin, et al., GCN 19926) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2016/09 18.12 to 2016/09 18.36 UTC (15.39 to
21.08 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 3.72 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.63 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 19927),
in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain the following
upper limits (3-sigma):

  r > 24.31
  i > 24.28
  Z > 23.20
  Y > 22.90
  J > 22.57
  H > 22.20

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
