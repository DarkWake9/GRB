Global MASTER Net was starting observations of the LIGO/Virgo G268556 
error field at 2017-01-04 15:46:07 UT during regular sky survey up to 20 
unfiltered magnitude.

After received alert circular (Shawhan et al.,20364) we started 
special inspection with 
MASTER-Amur, MASTER-Tunka, MASTER-Kislovodsk, MASTER-OAFA and MASTER-SAAO 
telescopes.  We cover 50.2% initial probability now up to 20.5 mag.


The first OT  MASTER OT J090021.21+635049.7 detection ( Possible SN in 
1.797"  from Sloan galaxy).


MASTER-Kislovodsk auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) 
= 09h 00m 21.21s +63d 50m 49.7s on 2017-01-05.06666 UT.
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 18.6m+-0.2 (limit 19.9m).

The OT is seen in 4 image.

We have reference image without OT on 2012-10-20.91652 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 19.7m.

No known minor planets, brighter than V = 21.0, were found in the 
15.0-arcminute region around R.A. = 09 00 21.21, Decl. = +63 50 49.7 
(J2000.0) on 2017 01 05.07 UT .

OT is offset  1.79709" from the Sloan galaxy rmag=19.96, gmag=20.64 
http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr9/en/tools/chart/navi.asp?ra=135.08928453&dec=63.84745156

Spectral and photometrical observations are required .
