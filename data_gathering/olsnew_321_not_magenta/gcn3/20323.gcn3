The long GRB 161219A (Swift-BAT trigger #727541: D'Ai et al.,
GCN 20296; Palmer et al., GCN 20308; T0(BAT)=18:48:19.308 UT)
was detected by Konus-Wind (KW) in the waiting mode.

The light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~10 s.
Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0(BAT)-0.134 s to T0(BAT)+8.698 s) by
a power law with exponential cutoff (CPL) model
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.59 ± 0.71 and Ep = 91 ± 21 keV.
The corresponding 20-1000 keV energy fluence for this
time interval is (3.1 ± 0.8)x10^-6 erg/cm2.

Assuming the redshift z=0.1475 (Tanvir et al., GCN 20321)
and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,
Omega_M = 0.27, and Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
we estimate the burst isotropic energy release E_iso to ~1.6x10^50 erg
and the rest-frame peak energy of the time-integrated spectrum,
Ep,i, to ~104 keV.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
