T. Giblin, G. Richardson, and R. M. Kippen (University of Alabama
in Huntsville) report on behalf of the BATSE GRB Team:


GRB990806 was detected by BATSE on 1999 August 6.60285 UT as trigger 
7701. The time profile of the burst exhibits a FRED-like structure 
(fast rise and slower decay) with some variability on shorter time 
scales. The T50 and T90 durations are 4.93 (+/- 0.26) and 17.41 
(+/- 3.84) seconds, respectively. The peak flux of the burst, 
integrated over 1.024 s in the 50-300 keV range, is 1.60 (+/- 0.05) 
photons cmE-2 sE-1, placing it in the top 28% of the BATSE peak flux 
distribution. The fluence (>20 keV) of the burst is 3.29 (+/- 0.53) 
x 10E-6 erg cmE-2, ranking it in the top 43% of the BATSE fluence 
distribution. The average spectral hardness of the burst (H32), as 
determined by the ratio of total counts in the 100-300 keV to the 
50-100 keV range, is 0.811 (+/- 0.034), average for BATSE GRBs of 
this duration. The BATSE location error circle (90% conf.) is 
slightly offset (~2 degrees) from the BeppoSAX WFC location (GCN 393). 
The lightcurve and skymap location that includes the WFC and BATSE 
locations for this event (and other notable GRBs) are available at
