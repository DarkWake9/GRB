The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On February 21st, 2019, IceCube detected a track-like, very-high-energy event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was identified by the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) track selection. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state. HESE tracks have a neutrino interaction vertex inside the detector and produce a muon that only partially traverses the detector volume, and have a high light level (a proxy for energy).  We encourage follow-up observations.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/66688965_132229.amon), more 
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2019/02/21 
Time: 08:25:40 UT
RA: 268.81 [-1.8,+1.2] (deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: -17.04 [-0.5,+1.3] (deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
