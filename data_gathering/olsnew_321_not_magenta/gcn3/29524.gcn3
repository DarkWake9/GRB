NUMBER:  29524
SUBJECT: Fermi/GBM observation of a burst from SGR 1830-0645

C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 08:11:21.50 UT on 17 February 2021 the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) triggered and located a burst from SGR 1830-0645
(trigger 635242286/ 210217341)). This SGR J1830 burst has also been reported
by Swift-BAT (Klingler et al., GCN 29516).

The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the known position of the SGR.

The burst has a duration (T90) of about 0.1 seconds.

It is adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.7 +/- 0.9 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as
Epeak, is 28.07 +/- 5.74 keV.

The event fluence (10-300 keV) from T0-0.144s to T0+0.003s
is  (4.4 +/- 0.7)E-08 erg/cm^2. The average photon flux in the 10-300 keV band during
this period is 7.6 +/- 0.9 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary.
