C. Guidorzi, I. A. Steele, A. Monfardini, C.J. Mottram, A. Gomboc,
D. Carter, M.F. Bode, C.G. Mundell, R.J. Smith (Liverpool JMU) report:

"The 2-m Liverpool Telescope followed up robotically the INTEGRAL
GRB050520 (Gotz et al, GCN 3430) and started observing 4.5 min after
the GRB at 00:10:25.7 UT.
The GRB pipeline did not detect any candidate r'<16.6 in the first 3
10-s images. In particular, no source has been found in the XRT error
circle (Kennea et al., GCN 3434).
From a 3x120s stacked image taken between 8 min and 16 min after the
GRB, we detect no candidate r'<20.
Limiting magnitudes have been derived by comparison with USNOB1.
These poor limits are mainly due to the proximity of the Moon.

This message can be cited."
