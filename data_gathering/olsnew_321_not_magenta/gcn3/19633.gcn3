Klotz A., Turpin D., Atteia J.L. (CNRS-OMP-IRAP),
Boer, M., Laugier, R. (CNRS-ARTEMIS),
Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160630A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 702252) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 33s after the GRB trigger
(15s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
34 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+33s to t0+93s : Rlim = 16.4

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+107s to t0+137s : Rlim = 17.5

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+107s to t0+302s : Rlim = 18.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
