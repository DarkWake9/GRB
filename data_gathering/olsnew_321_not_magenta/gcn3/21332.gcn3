During the commissioning phase, at 2017-07-12T03:20:30.00 (T0),
Insight-HXMT detected GRB 170712A (trigger ID: HEB170712139)
in a routine search of the data, which was also observed by
Konus-Wind (trig time: 2017-07-12T03:20:26.59).

The Insight-HXMT light curve consists of multiple pulses
with a duration (T90) of 8.6 s measured from T0-5.82 s.
The 1-second peak rate, measured from T0+0.5 s, is 1948.9 cnts/sec.
The total counts from this burst is 4455 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
GRB mode, in which the energy range is increased to about 200 - 3000 keV
(record energy) , compared to the normal mode of 80 - 800 keV.
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the telescope.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published elsewhere.

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at:
