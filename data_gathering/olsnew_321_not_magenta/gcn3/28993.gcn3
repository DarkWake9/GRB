College), K. Sharma (IITB), V. Bhalerao (IITB), G. C. Anupama (IIA), S.
Barway (IIA), report on behalf of the GROWTH-India collaboration:


We observed GRB 201203A reported by S. Dichiara et. al., (GCN 28985) with
0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope, starting at 2020-12-03T15:21:51.55 UT. We
obtained 25 images of 300 sec each in the r' filter. We did not detect any
new source within an uncertainty region of 3.3 arcseconds (radius, 90%
containment) around Swift-XRT position i.e., RA(J2000) = 02h 32m 13.25s,
Dec(J2000) = -26d 31' 05.5" (V. D'Elia et. al., GCN 28990).


We obtained the following upper limits:

------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD_Mid | T_mid-T0 (hrs) | Exposure(sec) | Filter | lim_Mag |

------------------------------------------------------------------

2459187.19431 | ~8.49 | 300*25 | r' | > 21.7 |

------------------------------------------------------------------

Magnitudes are in the AB system and are calibrated against PanSTARRs PS1
data release, (Flewelling et al., 2018).


The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
