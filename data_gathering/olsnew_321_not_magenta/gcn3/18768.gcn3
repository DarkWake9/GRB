After MASTER DataBase checking we found:

iPTF15fev  -   Known old  SN ASAS15rw MASTER-IAC Light Curve 
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/OT/iPTFfev.jpg

iPTF15fel -  2015-12-16 23:07:20   visible in MASTER-IAC   PSN detected 10 
days  before G211117

iPTF15ffm  -  observed by MASTER-IAC from 2015-11-15 22:14:53.869 so >40 
days before trigger

The reduction is continuated.

The delay  is connected with yang age of the MASTER-IAC 
survey (started June 2015). So we lost time to transfere parts of 
DATABase from Russia to IAC telescope.
