report

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 180325A (Troja et al., GCNC 22532)
with the 0.5m telescope D50 in Ondrejov (Czech Republic), starting at
01:53:47.1 UT, i.e. 44.3s after the trigger.

The observation consisted of a series of 10 s unfiltered exposures,
covering the peak of the optical emission at mag ~16.3. The maximum seems
to be somewhat delayed with respect to the bright peak in gamma-rays.

This message can be cited.
