(UMD) report:

We observed the field of GRB 170318B (Cholden-Brown et al., GCN 20908)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2017/03 19.47 to
2017/03 19.51 UTC (19.76 to 20.76 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 0.71 hours exposure in the r and i bands and 0.30
hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT enhanced error circle (Goad et al.,
GCN 20910), in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we obtain
the following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r    > 25.64
 i    > 24.39
 Z    > 22.65
 Y    > 22.43
 J    > 21.38
 H    > 20.98

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
