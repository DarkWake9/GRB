The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the data from LIGO Hanford
Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and Virgo
Observatory (V1) around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC)
candidate S190915ak (GCN Circular 25753). Parameter estimation has
been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky map,
LALInference.fits.gz, distributed via GCN Notice, is available for retrieval
from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190915ak

The preferred sky map at this time is LALInference.fits.gz. The 90%
credible region is 318 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a
posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1584 +/- 381 Mpc (a posteriori
mean +/- standard deviation).

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents of
this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
