SUBJECT: Correction to Eiso calculation in GCN 3835 on GRB 050820A

T. Sakamoto (GSFC/NRC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The isotropic-equivalent energy of GRB050820A reported in GCN 3835 
is not correctly represented.  We want to correct the last paragraph 
of GCN 3835 to the following.  

"The isotropic-equivalent energy using the redshift of 2.612 
(Prochaska, et al. GCN 3833) is (2.2 +- 0.13) x 10^52 ergs 
in the 54-542 keV band in the GRB rest frame (15-150 keV band 
in the observer's frame) using a simple power-law model."  

We would like to thank Dr. Arnon Dar for reporting about this mistake.
