D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. 
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Konus, RHESSI, and Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS) also observed this
burst (GCN 1779, 1780).  We have triangulated it to a preliminary
annulus centered at RA, Decl (2000)=43.742, 15.925 degrees, whose
radius is 88.444 +/- 0.115 degrees (3 sigma).  This annulus
can be refined and constrained, but as this burst was not observed
by Ulysses, a small error box cannot be obtained for it.
