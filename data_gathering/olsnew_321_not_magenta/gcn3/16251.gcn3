E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI), M. Eselevich (ISTP), I. Korobtsev
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 140512A (Pagani et al., GCN 16249)   with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy). We took several images 
in R-filter of 60 s exposure starting on May, 12 (UT) 19:56:58. We 
clearly detect a fading optical transient in the position reported early 
(Pagani et al., GCN 16249). A brightness of the OT in the first image is 
about R=16.7 (at (UT) 19:57:28, mid time). Observation is continuing.
