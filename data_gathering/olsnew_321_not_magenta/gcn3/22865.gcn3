Toy (UMD) report:

We observed the field of GRB 180626A (Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 22850)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/06 27.16 to
2018/06 27.20 UTC (19.60 to 20.46 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 0.71 hours exposure in the r and i bands.

For a source at the position of the UVOT counterpart, in comparison with
the SDSS DR9 catalog, we obtain the following detections:

  r	= 22.39 +/- 0.20
  i	= 21.92 +/- 0.15

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The source flux has faded approximately as t^-0.35 since our previous
observations (Troja et al., GCN Circ. 22855).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
