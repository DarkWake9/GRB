P. Jakobsson (U. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of the optical transient OT 110215 (Sergey et
al., GCNC 11739) using NOTCam at the 2.5m NOT telescope at Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). Observations consisted of K and
J-band observations starting on 16 Feb at 20:22 UT.

The source 2MASS J00264184+8324093 is clearly identified in the individual
images. We obtain photometric values of K=15.20+/-0.15 and J=16.45+/-0.12
consistent with those of the 2MASS catalogue. This implies that either the
OT is unrelated to this 2MASS source or it that it has already returned to
its quiescent state.

We note that within a radius of ~5" we detect a total of 4 sources in the
J-band image. with the following coordinates (J2000.0 +/- 0.5") and
magnitudes:

1: 00:26:42.07,+83:24:09.3 # J = 16.45+/-0.12 (2MASS J00264184+8324093)
2: 00:26:41.46,+83:24:15.4 # J = 20.33+/-0.15
3: 00:26:37.47,+83:24:13.6 # J = 19.95+/-0.12
4: 00:26:36.70,+83:24:08.2 # J = 19.49+/-0.12

At this moment we cannot state variability of any of the sources. The
3-sigma limiting magnitude of our J-band image is ~ 21.0.

Further analysis is ongoing.
