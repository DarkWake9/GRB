J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of the larger GRAASP  
collaboration:

"Automatically triggering off of the original GCN/SWIFT_BAT_POSITION  
notice for GRB 080129 (GCN 7226), we observed the field with Gemini  
South + GMOS in the r-band starting at 06:50:21.4 2008-01-29 in a  
series of 5 dithered exposures of 5 minutes apiece. Consistent with  
the position of the X-ray source (GCN 7228) we find a point-like  
object at:

     07:01:08.20  -07:50:46.3  (J2000)

(preliminary uncertainty of 300 mas rms relative to 2MASS). We suggest  
that this is the optical afterglow of GRB 080129 but cannot confirm  
variability at this time. More observations are encouraged."

We thank the Gemini Staff for conducting these observations.
