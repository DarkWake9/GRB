K.L. Page, S. Oates and D.N. Burrows report on behalf of the Swift-XRT 
team:

The Swift XRT began observing GRB 060108 (Oates et al., GCN 4443) 91
seconds after the BAT trigger. Analysis of the first pass of Malindi data
reveal a fading, uncatalogued X-ray source at:

RA(J2000)  =  09h 48m 01.5s
Dec(J2000) = +31d 55' 03.2"

with an estimated radial uncertainty of 3.7" (90% containment), including 
corrections for the XRT boresight. This position is 43" from the 
on-board BAT value given in GCN 4443.
