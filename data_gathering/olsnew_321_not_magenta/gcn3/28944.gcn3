We observed the field of INTEGRAL Weak #8831 and #8832 with the 14-inch
AGU Robotic Optical Monitor for Astrophysical object - Narrow (AROMA-N)
located at the Sagamihara campus of Aoyama Gakuin University.

INTEGRAL Weak #8831:
34 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
November 21 16:55:08 (UT) about 124 seconds after the trigger and stopped
on November 21 17:37:13 (UT).  We do not detect an optical afterglow
both in the individual images and the stacked image.  The estimated
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 2040 sec)
is ~17.5 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.

INTEGRAL Weak #8832:
59 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter starting from
November 21 17:40:29 (UT) about 166 seconds after the trigger and stopped
on November 21 18:53:57 (UT).  We do not detect an optical afterglow
both in the individual images and the stacked image.  The estimated
five sigma upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 3540 sec)
is ~17.5 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
