K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on
behalf of the Konus-Wind and NEAR GRB teams, and E. Mazets
and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at
00255 s UT.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
~7 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of ~4x10^-6 erg/cm^2, and
a peak flux over 0.25 s of ~5x10^-7 erg/cm^2.  We have
localized this burst to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose area is ~ 240 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 12 h 45 m  8.31 s     19 o 16 '  17.74 "  (CENTER)
 12 h 45 m 13.88 s     19 o 19 '  46.69 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 43 m 26.15 s     19 o 42 '  56.58 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 46 m 49.33 s     18 o 49 '  33.39 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 45 m  2.74 s     19 o 12 '  48.83 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be refined.
