Michael Briggs (UAH) and Alexander van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) report on
behalf of the GLAST Burst Monitor Team:

"At  21:19:33 UT on 2008 Aug 12, the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 080812 (trigger 240268774 / 080812.889).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 174.3, Dec = -41.3 (J2000 degrees)
(equivalent to J2000 11h 37m, -41d 18'),
with an uncertainty of 2.8 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) boresight is 71 degrees.

This GRB was about 15 s long with several peaks.  The time-averaged
spectrum from T-3.072 to T+14.336 s is best fit with a Comptonized
spectrum (power law times exponential cutoff).   The power law index is
+0.17 +/- 0.27 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak,
is 140 +/- 14 keV."
