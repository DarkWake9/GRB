team report:

The long GRB 130606A (Swift-BAT trigger #557589: Ukwatta et al., GCN
14781) was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a weak initial pulse followed in ~150 s by a 
much brighter peak.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of (4.4 +/- 
0.8)x10^-6 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1300 keV energy range).

Modeling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum (from T0(BAT)+153 s 
to T0(BAT)+165 s) by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -1.14 +/- 0.15, and Ep = 294(-50,+90) keV.

Assuming z = 5.91 (Castro-Tirado et al., GCN 14796; Chornock et al. GCN 
14798) and a standard cosmology model with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 
0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73, the isotropic energy release is E_iso =
(2.83 +/- 0.52)x10^53 erg in 1 keV to 10 MeV at the GRB rest frame
extrapolating the best exponential cutoff function fit.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
