Recently, increasing of SGR 1900+14 activity was detected
by Ulysses, Konus-Wind, Helicon-Coronas-F (GCNs 1643, 1655, 1665).

In the begining of November, Konus-Wind, and Helicon observed
a number of SGR-like trigger bursts:

	data	time		

1	021102	15415 s UT (Konus-Wind)
2	021102	18298 s UT (Helicon)
3	021102	23998 s UT (Konus-Wind, Helicon) 
4	021104	19157 s UT (Konus-Wind, Helicon)

As observed by Konus-Wind, they had durations 0.1-0.5 s, fluences
of ~5 - 7E-6 erg/cm2, and peak fluxes over 8 ms of ~ 3 - 5E-5 erg/cm2 s.
After the initial burst of event 3 (021102 23998 s UT),
a cluster of short bursts was detected during ~10 minutes
(both by Konus-Wind and Helicon).

We have triangulated two of these bursts to  annuli centered at:

021102 23998 s UT RA = 357.97, Decl = -4.73 deg,
			 radius 72.0 +/- 1.2 deg
021104 19157 s UT RA = 14.19, Decl = 1.42 deg,
			 radius 87.0 +/- 0.5 deg

These annuli pass through SGR1900+14.
Both, Konus-Wind and Helicon detected many SGR-like bursts 
on November, 2 in the background mode.

These data confirm that SGR 1900+14 has entered
a new phase of high activity (see also GCNs 1664, 1666).
