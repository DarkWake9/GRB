P. Romano (INAF-OAB), M. Perri (ASDC), A. Beardmore (U. Leicester), V. 
Mangano (INF-IASF/Palermo), D. N. Burrows, J. E. Hill,  (PSU), B. Zhang (U. 
Nevada), and N. Gehrels (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 12:40:01 UT on 19 February 
2005.  The observatory executed an automated slew to the BAT position and 
the XRT began taking data at 12:41:33.38 UT.  The XRT was in Auto state and 
reports a prompt position of:

GRB-RA= 166.41396, GRB-DEC= -40.68277

RA(J2000) = 11h 05m 39.4s

DEC(J2000) = -40:40:58.0
We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds.

We have not examined the XRT image yet due to technical problems, but at 
first glance, this appears to be a valid position.
