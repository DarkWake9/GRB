SUBJECT: GRB051021: Swift XRT analysis

(GSFC) on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

XRT began observing GRB051021 (Yoshida et al., GCN 4116) at 16:28:28 UT, 
approximately 3 hours after the HETE trigger.  From the first 2 orbits of 
data, we detect an uncatlogued fading X-ray source at:

RA(J2000):   01:56:36.4
Dec(J2000): +09:04:06.3

with an estimated uncertainty of 4 arcseconds (90% containment).

This position is 4.3 arcminutes from the HETE position reported by Yoshida 
et al.(GCN 4116), and 2.7 arcseconds from the optical afterglow position 
reported by Fox et al.(GCN 4120).

At the time of these observations using 4.7 ks of data, the measured flux 
was 2.7x10^-12 ergs/cm^2/s.  Further observations are necessary to measure 
the lightcurve decay slope.
