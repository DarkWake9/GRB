The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 03:18:00 UT on 23 Jun 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200623A (trigger 614575085.637496 / 200623138).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 224.3, Dec = 60.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 57m, 60d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25.0 degrees.
