Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink,
further analysis of Swift-BAT GRB050701 (GCN Circ 3556)
over the time interval of T-4.7 to T+8.9 sec with a power law fit
yields an index of 1.62 +-0.07 and a fluence of 1.9x10^-6 erg/cm2
in the 15-350 keV band and a peak flux of 3.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec
(also 15-350 keV) in a 1-sec wide window starting at T+7.3 sec.
The lightcurve has two main peaks with some pre-trigger emmission
starting at T-7 sec, and small peak at T+27 sec.

This burst occurred within the 40-arcmin search radius
of the PSR 1509-58 source in the on-board catalog.  Hence
the on-board trigger-type identification yielded a match.
This radius has been reduced to a more reasonable value
of 20 arcmin for this post-verification era.
