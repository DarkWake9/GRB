report:

We have observed the field of GRB 090323 (Ohno et al. GCN 9021)
with the 2.5m NOT telescope (+ALFOSC) at Roque de los Muchachos
Observatory (Spain). The mean epoch of our observations is March
29.323 UT (6.327 days after the burst). The afterglow (Kennea et
al. GCN 9024, Updike et al. GCN 9026) is clearly detected in the
6x300s combined exposure with R=22.80+/-0.06.  As photometric
reference we used the object indicated by Kann et al. (GCN 9033).
Our measurement is consistent with the absence of a light curve
steepening, as noted one day earlier by Kann et al. (GCN 9041).
A lightcurve composed of GCN data together with our observation
shows a possible flattening during the last 3 days.

Further observations are foreseen.
