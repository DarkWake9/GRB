E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI), A. Kusakin (Fesenkov Astrophysical 
Institute),  A. Pozanenko  (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150423A (Pagani et al., GCNC 17728) with 
Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory 
starting on Apr. 23 (UT) 17:43:02.  We obtained several  images in R-filter. 
In a combined image we marginally detect the source S2 and do not detect the 
afterglow (Varela et al., GCN 17729). Coordinates of the S2  (J2000) 14 46 
18.94  +12 17 04.4  with an uncertainty of  0.4" is marginally coincide with 
coordinates reported by Varela et al.  (GCN 17729).

A preliminary photometry is following
