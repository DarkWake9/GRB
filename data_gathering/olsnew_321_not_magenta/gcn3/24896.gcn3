J. Mao, C.-J. Wang and J.-M. Bai report:


We observed the field of GRB 190627A (Sonbas et al. GCN Circ. 24888) with the 2.4-meter optical telescope at Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) station of Yunnan Observatories. The observation began at UT 13:49:34, 27, June, 2019, about 2.5 hours after the trigger. We clearly detected the afterglow (Sonbas et al. GCN Circ. 24888; Siegel et al. GCN Circ 24889). We obtained the preliminary magnitude of R~16.9. We compared our result to those from other reports (e.g., Pozanenko et al. GCN Circ 24892, Leonini et al. GCN Circ 24893, Morris et al. GCN Circ. 24894, and Lipunov et al. GCN Circ. 24895). It seems that there was a brightening phase during about 3 hours after the trigger. We encourage other groups for the further investigation.
