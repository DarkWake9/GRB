Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 090812 (trigger #359711)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 9768).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 353.200, -10.609 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 32m 47.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 36' 34.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 78%.
 
The burst starts at ~T-4 sec and ends at ~T+120 sec, with 3 peaks at ~T+5 sec,
 ~T+27 sec and ~T+55 sec, respectively. T90 (15-350 keV) is 66.7 +- 14.7 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.4 to T+113.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.24 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+26.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 3.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
