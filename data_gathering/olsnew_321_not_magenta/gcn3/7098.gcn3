report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 14:50:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071117 (trigger=296805).  Swift did not slew immediately 
to the burst due to an Earth constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 335.020, -63.441 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 20m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 26' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single FRED
peak with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~16000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Because of an Earth limb constraint, the spacecraft did not slew promptly
to the BAT position, and so there are no immediate XRT data products
to analyze.  NFI observations are expected at T+43 minutes, when it comes
out of constraint. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
