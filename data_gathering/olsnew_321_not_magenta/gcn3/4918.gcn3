S. B. Cenko, E. O. Ofek, A. M. Soderberg (Caltech), and D. B. Fox (Penn
State) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060323 (Vetere et al.; GCN 4904) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations were taken in both the
i' (mean epoch March 24.22 UT) and z' (mean epoch March 24.28 UT) filters,
approximately 15.5 hours after the burst.

Inside the XRT error circle (Kennea et al.; GCN 4908), we do not find any
sources.  The limiting magnitude of our coadded images is approximatly i'
> 21.5, z' > 20.5, calibrated with respect to the SDSS pre-burst data
provided by Cool et al. (GCN 4905).  In particular, we note we do not
detect the optical afterglow (Covino et al.; GCNs 4911, 4916) to the above
limits.
