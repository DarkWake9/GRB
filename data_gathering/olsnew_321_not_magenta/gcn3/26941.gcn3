and the CALET collaboration:

At the trigger time of the compact binary merger candidate 
S200129m T0 = 2020-01-29 06:54:58.435 UT (The LIGO 
Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 
Circ. 26926), the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
high voltages were off (from T0-31 min to T0+1 min).

The CALET Calorimeter (CAL) was operating in the high 
energy trigger mode at the trigger time of S200129m. Using
the CAL data, we have searched for gamma-ray events in the
10-100 GeV band from -60 sec to +60 sec from the GW trigger 
time and found no candidates in the overwrap region with the
LIGO-Virgo high probability localization region.  The 90% 
upper limit of CAL is 5.7 x 10^-5 erg/cm^2/s (10-100 GeV) 
when the summed LIGO-Virgo probability reaches 5%. The CAL 
FOV was centered at RA = 288.7 deg, DEC = -34.3 deg at T0.
