T. Schweyer (MPE Garching) and D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) report on
behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 151205A (Swift trigger 666352; J. R. Cummings
et al., GCN #18657) with the Garching 0.6m telescope.

Observations started at 16:24:57 UT on 2015-12-05, about 39 min after the
GRB trigger. They were performed at an average airmass of 3.4 during
evening twilight.

We obtained 6 images of 180s exposure time in R (for a total exposure time
of 18 min) with the midtime at 16:35:18 UT (MJD=57361.691180). We do not
detect a source within the 1".8 enhanced XRT error circle (J. P. Osborne
et al., GCN #18658), down to a limiting magnitude of R(AB) > 19.4 mag. The
R band is calibrated against SDSS DR8.
