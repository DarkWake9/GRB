A. Blustin (MSSL), C. Hurkett (U. Leicester), A. Smale (NASA HQ),
L. Cominsky (Sonoma State U.) report on behalf of the Swift
UVOT team:

Using summed images from Swift/UVOT of the field of
GRB 050717 (Hurkett et al., GCN 3633), taken from 78
seconds after the BAT trigger, no new source is detected
within the refined XRT error circle (Hurkett et al.,
GCN 3636) in any of the six filters down to the following
3-sigma magnitude upper limits:

Filter   Exposure (s)  T_mid (s)   3-sig limit
V        168           424         19.00
B        75            524         19.59
U        78            511         19.34
UVW1     78            498         18.62
UVM2     78            483         18.79
UVW2     68            498         18.73

where T_mid is the mid-point of the summed observation.

We caution that the instrument is not yet fully
calibrated and that the magnitude limits presented here
may need to be refined.
