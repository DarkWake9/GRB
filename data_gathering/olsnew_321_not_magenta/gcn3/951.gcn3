report:

"The BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and the Wide Field Camera
(WFC) unit 2 observed the GRB 010214 (2nd Valentine's burst) on
February 14.36679 UT. The event detected by the GRBM shows a single pulse
with a time duration of about 20 s and a peak  countrate of about 
650 cts/s in the 40-700 keV energy band. In the WFC, the duration is about
30 s and the peak flux is 0.8 Crab (2-26 keV). The centroid position of
the X-ray counterpart from the WFC image is R.A.= 17h 41m 00s,
Decl.= +48deg 32' 38" (equinox 2000.0) with a 99% error radius of 3'
(se also GCN 933). Results of the BeppoSAX follow-up observation  are
reported by Frontera et al. (GCN 950)."
