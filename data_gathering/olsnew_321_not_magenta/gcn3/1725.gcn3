K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, Konus, and Mars Odyssey GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 11900
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately
125 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately 5E-06 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  6.3E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 2300 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:   3 h  4 m 27.02 s     84 o 51 '  34.82 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  2 h 10 m 27.92 s     85 o 31 '  19.15 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  3 h 49 m 20.75 s     83 o 31 '  50.18 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  1 h 58 m  2.97 s     85 o 52 '   7.15 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  3 h 45 m 52.31 s     83 o 58 '   6.25 " 

This error box may be improved.
