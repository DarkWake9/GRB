All observations was done under the MASTER target of opportunity program 
that includes the results of population synthesis  by Scenario Machine 
(Lipunov et al., "First LIGO events: 
binary black holes mergings", New Astronomy, Vol. 2,  p. 43-52, 1997).
There are number arhive images just before trigger.
One (GCN 25354)  of our previous circulars was sent erroneously. Here we 
give the correct schedule of our observations.

MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, Kislovodsk Solar 
Station of Pulkovo observatory) started inspect of the LIGO/Virgo 
S190814bv errorbox  1327 sec after trigger time at 2019-08-14 21:32:46 UT 
(Lipunov et al., GCN 25322).

MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  located in South Africa (South African 
Astronomical Observatory) started inspect of the LIGO/Virgo S190814bv 
errorbox  1351 sec after trigger time at 2019-08-14 21:33:10 UT, with 
upper limit up to  19.4 mag (Lipunov et al., GCN 25322).

MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope  located at Crimea started
inspect of the LIGO/Virgo S190814bv errorbox  1373 sec after trigger time
at 22019-08-14  21:33:32 UT.


MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located at Tenerife (Spain) started inspect 
of the LIGO/Virgo S190814bv errorbox  4200 sec after trigger time at 
2019-08-14 22019-08-14 22:20:39 UT.

Our coadded images limit is:

We see host galaxy and OT on some images.
For example Robot find MASTER OT J005332.32-234958.5 at 23 Aug:

        Date                   RA              Dec      Tube    OT mag
                                                              unfiltered
2019-08-23 02:45:31.4 00h 53m 32.32s, -23d 49m 58.48s   W     20.1



However, the object is visible at the limit and therefore reduction is 
continuated.
