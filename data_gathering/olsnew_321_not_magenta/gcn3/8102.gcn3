report:

We observed the GRB 080810 afterglow (Page et al. GCN Circ. 8080)
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK
National Observatory, Turkey).

The series of several exposures in V,Rc,Ic bands were made
by using Andor CCD starting at 13 Aug 2008, 00:24 UT, i.e. ~ 59.23 hours 
after the burst.

Using USNO-B1.0 stars we estimate an Rc magnitude of 21.60+/-0.05
(~59.85 hours after the burst).

This measurement deviates from the power law decay with index -0.9
(Galeev et al., GCN8098,Guidorzi et al, GCN8099), that indicates steeper 
fading of OT after 48h.
