(YNAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope. Observation
was started at 13:25:18 UT on 2013-04-27 (i.e., 5.6 hrs after the burst) under a bad weather condition. The sloan filters of g', r',i' and z' were used. The afterglow is very bright in every band with magnitudes of g'~16.36, r'~16.1, i'~15.9 and z'~15.8. The observations are ongoing. 
   
We thank the GMG staff, especially Hong-Yan Gao and Jian-Duo He for
performing these observations.
