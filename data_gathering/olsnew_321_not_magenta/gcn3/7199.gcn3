B. Sbarufatti, V. Mangano (INAF-IASF PA)
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed the 3.9 ks of data of the ToO observation of GRB  
080120,
started on Jan 20 at 19:47 UT. The refined position of the X-ray  
source is

  Ra (J2000):  15h 01m 03.14s
Dec (J2000): -10d 52' 30.7"

with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is
1.1 arcsec away from the first XRT position given in
Sbarufatti & Mangano (GCN Circ. 7195), 47.2 arcsec from
the initial INTEGRAL position of Mereghetti et al.  (GCN Circ. 7194),
and 2.2 arcsec from the  optical counterparts reported by Kruehler et  
al.
(GCN Circ, 7197) and by Schady & Sbarufatti (GCN Circ. 7198).

The light curve shows an initial flare between 8 and 9 ks from the
trigger, followed by a very steep decay (slope 2.9 +/- 0.4).
At this decay rate the source will be at a level of 3E-4 counts/s today
at 17:30 UT.

The average spectrum can be modeled by an absorbed powerlaw with
photon index 2.5 +/- 0.3 with a column density of (1.5 +/- 0.6)E21  
cm^-2,
sligthly in excess with respect to the Galactic value (7.7E20 cm^-2).
The observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux is
4.7E-12 (8.2E-12) ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
