We observed the field of GRB140629A (Lien et al. GCN 16477) with the
Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and VATT4K CCD camera
on 2014 June 30.2757 (UT). The afterglow is well-detected in two 300s
exposures through a SDSS-r filter.

Calibrating from SDSS stars in the field we estimate the afterglow to be
r=21.08 +/- 0.03 mag at 16.33 hours after the burst.

Combining the brightness reported here and SDSS magnitudes estimated by
Malesani et al. (GCN 16485) and Perley et al. (GCN 16491), the optical power
law decay index is 1.7 between 7 and 16 hours after the burst.
