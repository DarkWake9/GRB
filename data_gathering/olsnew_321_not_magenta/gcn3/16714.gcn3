Eric Burns (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:44:15.70 UT on 18 August 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor triggered and located GRB 140818B (trigger 430080258
/ 140818781). which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Burrows et al. 2014, GCN 16709). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position. The angle
from the Fermi LAT boresight is 32 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one main peak followed by
multiple smaller peaks with a duration (T90) of about 23.6 s
(50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.14 s to
T0+20.5 s is best fit by a simple power law function with
index -1.7 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.6 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+0.26 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 1.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
