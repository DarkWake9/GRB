"We have imaged the field of GRB 991014, centered on the BeppoSAX NFI
source (BeppoSAX mail n 99/28) with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.4
GHz and 8.46 GHz beginning on Oct 16.59 UT. No sources are visible
within the region bounded by the NFI error circle above a 5-sigma
level of 125 microJy (8.46 GHz) and 220 microJy (1.4 GHz). Further
observations are planned."
