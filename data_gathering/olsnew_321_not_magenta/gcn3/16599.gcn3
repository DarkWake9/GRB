P. Jenke (UAH) and H.-F. Yu (MPE) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:27:57.66 UT on July 16 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140716A (trigger 427199280/140716436),
which was also detected by 
Swift (J. R. Cummings et al. 2014, GCN 16596).  
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger
data, is consistent with the Swift/BAT location. 

The angle of the burst direction to the Fermi LAT boresight
is 137 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one FRED-like short peak near T0 and a
longer double peak at ~T0+100s with a duration (T90) of about
106 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+89s to T0+108s 
is well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 92 +/- 13 keV, 
Alpha = -0.8 +/- 0.2 and Beta = -2.07 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.03 +/- 0.04)E-05 ergs/cm^2. The 1.0-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+100s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 11.3 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
