report on behalf of the Zadko Telescope team and GRANDMA collaboration;

We performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo BNS event S190425z with 
the Zadko telescope, using a clear filter.

The observation started on 04/25/19 14:56:19 UTC which corresponds 
approximately to 6.65 hours after the GW trigger time. However, due to 
hardware issues, the first images of interest were obtained the next day 
(04/26/19, 14:19:00 UTC)

We performed the following observations in galaxy targeting mode:

   R.A.      DEC.
16:57:53 -01:56:51
16:57:38 -01:48:37
16:57:07 -01:52:10
16:04:51 +24:03:15
16:04:32 +23:55:05

We have not found any credible counterpart candidate, down to R ~ 16.
