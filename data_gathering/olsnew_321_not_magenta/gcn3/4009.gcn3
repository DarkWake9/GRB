"We have observed the field covering the error circle of
GRB 050922(GCN4008;Swift-BAT Trigger time is 15:02:00 UT)
with the unfiltered CCD camera on the 30-cm telescope
at University of Miyazaki.
The observation was started 15:28:46 UT on Sep.22.
After co-adding a set of 6 images (15:28:46 - 15:37:46 UT)
of 30 sec exposures, we have compared with the USNO A2.0 catalog.
Preliminary analysis shows there is no new source brighter than
16.1 mag."
