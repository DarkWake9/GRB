The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:39:59 UT on 12 May 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190512A (trigger 579364804.721872 / 190512611).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 80.3, Dec = -10.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 21m, -10d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25.0 degrees.
