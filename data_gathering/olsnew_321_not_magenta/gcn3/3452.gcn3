J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU), M. Perri (ASDC), J. Cummings (GSFC) and
N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

INTEGRAL detected XRF 050522 at 06:00:21 UT on 22th May 2005 (GCN Circ
3446). The Swift observatory executed an Target of Opportunity observation
of the INTEGRAL position and the XRT began taking data at 15:08:29 UT. In
a preliminary data analysis we detect a single uncataloged X-ray source
in the field, located at:

RA(J2000) = 13:20:19.4,
Dec(J2000) = +24:46:11

We estimate an uncertainty of 6 arcseconds radius (90% containment). This
position is 3.9 arcminutes from the INTEGRAL position reported in GCN
3446, and lies outside of the 2.5 arcmin INTEGRAL error circle.
Preliminary analysis suggests that this source does not fade significantly
in observations across 2 orbits. We therefore tentatively suggest that
this source is not related to XRF 050522. Observations of this field with
Swift are continuing.
