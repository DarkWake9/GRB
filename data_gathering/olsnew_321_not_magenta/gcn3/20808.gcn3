We report the following Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations of EM
candidates originally reported in GCN #20791. Observations were made with
the SPRAT spectrograph, and supernova classifications were obtained using
SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).


iPTF17bpw was observed on 2017-03-02 at 22:20UT. The transient is centrally
located within its host galaxy and the spectrum shows strong emission lines
indicative of an AGN.

iPTF17bou was observed on 2017-03-02 at 22:53UT. We tentatively classify
this transient as a type II SN at +58 days with z=0.131.
