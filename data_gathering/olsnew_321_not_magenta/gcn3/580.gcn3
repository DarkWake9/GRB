Frank Bertoldi  (MPIfR Bonn) reports: 
 
The likely afterglow of GRB 000301C (Smith et al., GCN 568) was
detected at 250 GHz (1.2 mm) with the 37 channel Max-Planck Millimeter
Bolometer (MAMBO) array (80 GHz bandwidth, 10.7 arcsec HPBW) at the
IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta, at the position reported by Fynbo
et al. (GCN 570) and Halpern et al. (GCN 578).  The object was
observed on 4 March 2000 from UTC 7 to 11:30, in standard on-off mode,
under good weather conditions (stable atmosphere with opacity slowly
rising from 0.21 to 0.26), and good pointing accuracy (<2").  The
total on plus off target integration time was 7800 seconds. 
A source is clearly detected with flux density

          f(250 GHz)  =  1.9 +- 0.3  mJy

We hope to continue monitoring its flux.
