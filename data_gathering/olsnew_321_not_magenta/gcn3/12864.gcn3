A. Crain report:

Skynet observed the field of GRB 120119A with the PROMPT telescopes located 
at CTIO in Chile. Observations in B, R, and I began at 04:05:08 UT, 38 
seconds after the burst. We detect an optical source consistent with the 
UVOT position reported by Beardmore et. al. (GCN 12859) in all three 
filters.  The optical afterglow faded for the first ~2.3 minutes, then 
brightened until approximately minute 14, after which it resumed fading. 
The afterglow is red, with (I - R) ~ 1 mag and (R - B) ~ 2 mag.

Further observations are ongoing.
