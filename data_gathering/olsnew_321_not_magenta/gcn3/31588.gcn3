The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:02:40 UT on 14 Feb 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220214A (trigger 666489765.60832 / 220214002).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 125.9, Dec = 16.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 23m, 16d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 99.0 degrees.
