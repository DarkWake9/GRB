TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2180
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB030428 (two large error boxes)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 81079 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 10 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.1E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  1.5E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 152.915, 37.832 degrees, whose radius is 87.747 +/-  0.019
degrees (3 sigma).  In addition, the Konus ecliptic latitude response
limits the arrival directions to ecliptic latitudes between -23 and -33
degrees, that is, to those portions of the annulus between
approximately RA, Decl = 193.2, -41.8 and 205.3, -35.3 degrees, and
between 74.2, -10.6 and 66.9, -1.5 degrees.

This localization can be improved, but as the event was not observed by
Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for it.
