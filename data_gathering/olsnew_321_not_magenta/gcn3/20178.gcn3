Using the data set from T-240 to T+499 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161113A (trigger #722063)
(D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 20172).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 179.794, -5.316 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 59m 10.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -05d 18' 57.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a pair of overlapping peaks, both containing 
substructure.  The first peak begins at T-3 sec and peaks at T+5 sec.  The second
peaks at T+15 sec and continues until about T+60 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 42.60 +- 11.10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.12 to T+64.88 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.73 +- 0.10.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+15.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
