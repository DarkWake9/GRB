Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:05:22.75 UT on 28 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140528A (trigger 423000325 / 140528837)
which was triangulated by IPN (Golenetskii et al. 2014, GCN 16339).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with IPN triangulation.

The GBM light curve shows a complex structure, consisting of multiple peaks
with a total duration (T90) of about 13.6 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+1.024 s to T0+14.591 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.56 +/- 0.03 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 270 +/- 6 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.3 +/- 0.3)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+11.20 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 13.6 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
