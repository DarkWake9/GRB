T. Kawabata, K. Ayani (BAO), H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ.), N. Kawai, and Y.
Urata (Titech / RIKEN), report:

"We performed R-band observations of GRB 021113 (Yoshida et al., GCN
1686) field with the Bisei Astronomical Observatory (BAO) 1.01-m
telescope starting at Nov. 13 11:13 UT (4.6 hrs after the burst). The
six-field mosaic images were obtained, which cover about 85% of refined
error box (Hurley et al., GCN 1692) during 11:13-12:39 UT.  From 14:05
UT, we imaged eight-field mosaic covering the entire error box. The
limiting magnitudes of the first six and later eight mosaic images based
on USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes were R ~ 17.6 and R ~ 18.1, respectively. No
new object was detected in comparison with DSS II red image."
