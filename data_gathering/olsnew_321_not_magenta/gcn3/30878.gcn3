The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 23:02:52 UT on 24 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210924A (trigger 654217377.138008 / 210924960).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 107.1, Dec = 45.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 08m, 45d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 22.0 degrees.
