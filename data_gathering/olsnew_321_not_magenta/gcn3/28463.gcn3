The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 15:36:47 UT on 20 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200920A (trigger 622309012.161358 / 200920651).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 211.1, Dec = -24.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 04m, -24d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 91.0 degrees.
