The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:16:41 UT on 3 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200703B (trigger 615511006.839074 / 200703970).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 148.5, Dec = 6.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 54m, 6d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 63.0 degrees.
