We have obtained Rc, Ic, and B-band images covering the entire
error box for XRF040916 (=H4588, Yamazaki et al., GCN 2712;
Yamamoto et al. GCN 2713) with SuprimeCam attached on the
prime-focus of the Subaru 8.2m telescope atop Mauna Kea. We
conducted a preliminary analysis and found a fading object
located at coordinates:

RA: 23:00:55.1   Dec: -05:38:43   J2000

The object was seen to fade in either of Rc, Ic, and B bands.
Observing dates and tentative Rc-band magnitudes of OT are
shown below.  Photometric accuracy is roughly +/- 0.2 mag.
