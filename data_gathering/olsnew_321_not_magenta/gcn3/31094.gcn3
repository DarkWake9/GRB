Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported gold track event IceCube-211117A (GCN#31093 <https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/31093.gcn3>). The reconstructed origin was 11.5 degrees below the horizon for ANTARES at the time of the alert.

No muon neutrino candidate events were recorded within 90% error box of the IceCube event during a +/- 1h time-window centered on the IceCube event time, and over which the potential source remained visible. This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of about 15 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 3 TeV â€“ 3.5 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 43 GeV.cm^-2 (610 GeV - 320 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. 

A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (50% visibility). 

ANTARES <http://antares.in2p3.fr/> is the largest undersea neutrino detector (Mediterranean Sea) and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
