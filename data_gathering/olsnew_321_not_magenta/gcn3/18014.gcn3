Antonio de Ugarte Postigo (DARK/NBI), and Vincent Van Eylen 
(Aarhus University) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150711A (Bernardini et al. GCN 
18011) with the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped 
with AlFOSC starting at 21:18 UT (2.80 hrs after the trigger). 
The observation consisted of 3x300s in r-band and 3x300s in 
i-band and was performed at high airmass and with a seeing of 
~ 3". We do not detect any source within the XRT error box 
(Osborne et al. GCN 18012) down to a limiting magnitude of 
r ~ 21.5.
