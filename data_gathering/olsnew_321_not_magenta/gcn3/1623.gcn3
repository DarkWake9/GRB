On Oct 10.1 UT, we observed the optical counterpart of GRB 021004
(Shirasaki et al., GCN 1565; Fox, GCN 1564) using the 3.6m TNG telescope
in the Canary Islands, with DOLORES (B and R filters) and NICS (H
filter).  Calibration was performed with respect to the comparison star
used by Fox and calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583) and the 2MASS
calibration of the field. The source has the following magnitudes:

UT      Band    Mag     Error
