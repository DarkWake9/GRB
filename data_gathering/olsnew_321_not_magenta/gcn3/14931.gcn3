At 10:51:03 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130626A (trigger=559075).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 273.130, -9.531 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 12m 31s
   Dec(J2000) = -09d 31' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 10:52:02.1 UT, 58.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger, but centroided on a cosmic ray. Because of the short 
on-target time, we do not have enough data to identify an afterglow. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of  57 seconds with the White filter
starting 67 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the BAT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle. No correction has
been made for the large, but uncertain extinction expected. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. De Pasquale (m.depasquale AT ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
