At 2008-11-05 T0=48372.403 s UT (13:26:12.403), a long soft GRB,
GRB 081105 triggered Konus/Wind. The IPN was informed, and Swift/BAT,
AGILE-MCAL, Suzaku/WAM, and INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS reported coincident
rate increases. Ground analysis of BAT data (trigger #333811) yielded 
a significant image peak that was found to be coincident with the IPN 
timing triangulation annulus. The location of the burst was
RA, Dec 3.966, 3.454, uncertainty radius of 2.5 arcmin, which is

   RA(J2000) = 00h 15m 51.8s
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 27' 14"

The source was found onboard, but not with high enough significance
to trigger an automatic burst response. The partial coding was only
2.5%.

The burst was a single peak, about 10 seconds long.

A Swift TOO has been requested and approved. The Swift narrow-field
instruments should begin observing the burst at about 04:30 UT, 15
hours after the burst.
