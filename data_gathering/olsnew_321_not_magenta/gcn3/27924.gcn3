Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200612A (trigger #977310)
(E. Sonbas et al., GCN Circ. 27915). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 302.691, -45.354 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  20h 10m 45.8s
   Dec(J2000) = -45d 21' 12.7"
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 96%.

The mask weighted light curve shows a complex structure. The
overall structure starts at ~T-20 s and lasts till ~T+200 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 171.48 +- 19.74 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-11 to T+193 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.03 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
