on behalf of the Swift team report:


At 04:08:48, BAT detected a source that was not in its on-board catalog
and reported it as a GRB (Trigger #152652). However, comparison to the
SIMBAD database finds a previously-known INTEGRAL gamma-ray source,
IGR J16479-4514, at a distance of 2.1 arcmin from the reported location,
which is within the BAT error circle.

Therefore we believe that this trigger was due to the known Integral
source, and not a GRB.
