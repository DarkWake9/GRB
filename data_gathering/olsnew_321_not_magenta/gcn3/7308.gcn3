Poonam Chandra (NRAO/UVA) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:


"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 080212 (GCN 7296) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2008 February
13.53 UT. The radio afterglow of the GRB is undetected at the
Swift-XRT position (GCN 7300) or optical afterglow position (GCN 7303).
The peak flux density at the afterglow position is 83 +/- 51 uJy.
