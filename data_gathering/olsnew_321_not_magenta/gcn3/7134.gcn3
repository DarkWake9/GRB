P. A. Evans reports:

The UVOT-enhanced position just circulated for "GRB 071126" should be 
ignored. We have reenabled the automatic production of GCN Circulars 
announcing the UVOT-enhanced XRT positions of GRBs, in order to 
disseminate these as rapidly as possible. Unfortunately, due to a minor 
hole in the automated processing, the trigger on SGR 1900+14 was treated 
like a GRB and the name deduced from the date.

We have now closed this hole in the processing, and apologise for any 
confusion. Trigger 297434 was correctly identified as SGR 1900+14, and 
was NOT a GRB.
