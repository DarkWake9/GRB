We observed the field of the short GRB 201214B (Simpson et al.,
GCN 29045; Fermi GBM team, GCN 29039) using the Large Monolithic Imager
(LMI) on the 4.3m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT) at Happy Jack, AZ.
Observations started on December 15, at 11:21 UT (about 19.2 hours after
the Swift trigger) using the SDSS r, i and z filters. Observations were
taken at an airmass of about 1.3 and seeing of about 2.5". Our average
sensitivity is i<23.5 AB mag.

We do not detect any uncatalogued optical source at the position of the
Swift/XRT sources reported by Tohuvavohu et al. (GCN 29052).

By cross-correlating the refined BAT localization with the GLADE v2.3
galaxy catalog (Dalya et al. 2018), as described in Dichiara et al.
(2020), we note the presence of a nearby lenticular galaxy
(HyperLEDA-1359588 at ~280 Mpc) within the BAT error circle.

Further observations are planned.

We thank the staff of the Lowell Discovery Telescope for assistance with
these observations.
