After analysis of the full data set from the recent Swift-BAT trigger
(trigger=154073) at 01:20:29.72 UT on 8-Sep-2005 we have
determined that this event is due to a cosmic ray hit on the detector
array and not a GRB.  The spacecraft did not slew to the burst because
it was located 39 degrees from the sun, within the spacecraft sun constraint.

Due to the sun constraint there were no observations with the XRT or UVOT
and no observations are planned.

NOTE: This trigger (154073) is not to be confused with trigger (154112)
which we are currently analyzing.
