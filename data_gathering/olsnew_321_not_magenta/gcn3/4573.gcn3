The bright and long burst, GRB 060117 (Swift-BAT trigger 
#177666; Campana et al., GCN 4533), triggered the Suzaku 
Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which is sensitive to an 
energy band of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 06:50:00 (UT). 
The observed light curve shows multi-peak structures
with a duration (T90) of 16 seconds. 
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was (1.5 +/- 0.1)X10^-5 erg/cm2. 
The 1-s peak flux was 9.2 +/- 0.4 photons/cm2/s 
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum 
is well fitted by a single power law with a photon index 
of 2.5 +/- 0.2.

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
The WAM in-flight calibration is still under way, and systematic 
errors, such as the flux calibration uncertainties of about 20%, 
are not included in the errors.

The WAM light curve of this event is available at

Further detailed analysis and the refinement are in progress.
