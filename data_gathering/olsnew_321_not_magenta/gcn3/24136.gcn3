report on behalf of the SVOM Ground Follow-up Group:


We observed 7 sky regions (total: 1100 square degrees) to cover the
skymap of the advanced LIGO/Virgo trigger S190412M, with SVOM/GWAC,
at Xinglong Observatory equipped with a set of two types of wide angle
cameras: FFOV cameras (FOV~900 square degrees/camera, aperture = 3.5
cm) and JFOV cameras (FOV~150 square degrees/camera, aperture = 18
cm). SVOM/GWAC currently comprises 4 FFOV cameras and 16 JFOV cameras,
working with unfiltered band. The observations are operated in time-series
mode, taking one exposure every 15 seconds (10s exposure + 5s readout).
We estimate a 95% prior probability that these 7 regions contain the
true location of the source.
The coordinates of the 7 regions and observation time are list following:

The first image was taken ~8 hours after the event trigger time. The
weather conditions were bad (cloudy) during the observations. A 3
sigma limiting magnitude of about 14 mag in R band is obtained in
our single frames. No credible new source is detected by our online
pipeline.
A more detailed image analysis including co-addition is ongoing with
our offline pipeline to search for transient candidates.
