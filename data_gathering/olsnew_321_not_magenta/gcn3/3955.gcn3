report:

We observed the error box of GRB 050906 (Parsons et al., GCN 3935) with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey). We made 6x300s exposures in R and similar set of
exposures in I between 00:07--01:16 UT on Sep. 07, and also a set of 300s
exposures in R band between 00:46-01:35 UT on Sep 08.

Comparing our two epochs we found no new or fading source brighter than
R~22.9. The limiting magnitude in I is 20.5.

We specially checked that between our two epochs there were no new or
variable sources superimposed on the bright nearby galaxy IC 328 (Levan
& Tanvir GCN 3927).
