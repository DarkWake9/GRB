The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began settled observations 
of the Swift-BAT and IPN localization GRB 081105 (#333811; Cummings et 
al., GCN 8484) ~16 hours after the BAT trigger. No afterglow is detected 
at the XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN 8487) in any filter. The 
3-sigma limiting magnitudes in each of the observed UVOT filters are as 
follows:

Filter  T_start(dys) Exp(s)  Mag UL (3sig)

white     0.67        159     > 20.76
v         0.81        630     > 19.92
b         0.66        885     > 21.05
u         0.74        224     > 19.92
uvw1      0.73        886     > 20.75
uvw2      0.89        886     > 21.02

The values quoted above are in the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. 
2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).  They are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)=0.03 mag in the 
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
