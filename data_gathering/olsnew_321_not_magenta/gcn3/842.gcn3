GRB001005: CONCAM crude optical limits before and after GRB trigger

report on behalf of the CONCAM collaboration:

The CONtinuous CAMera (CONCAM) operating on the roof of the 
RMT building at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona has 
recorded data that provides very crude limits on the attributes 
of an OT through non-detection. 

A continuing series of two-minute exposures were taken on 
October 5 from 7057 s to 39623 s which brackets 12309 s, the 
time of the GRB trigger reported by Hurley et al. GCN 838.  
About 100 s of dead time follows each 120 s integration.  
Frame kp001005ut0321 starts at 12155 s and continues to 
12275 s, while frame kp001005ut0325 starts at 12374 s and 
continues to 12494 s.  Raw FITS data are available at 
http://concam.net .  Processed GIF images of these frames 
are available here:

We note that although the Moon was in the field, the position
of GRB001005 is relatively unaffected.

The position of GRB001005 is placed on the east edge of 
the CONCAM field and rotates through to the west edge during 
the night.  Clouds and internal moonlight reflections 
occasionally degrade the image, mostly during the beginning 
of the night.

No obvious optical counterpart down to about visual magnitude 4
over a two-minute exposure is visible on the frames.  Future analysis
including the addition of all the night's frames might provide
limits down to visual magnitude 8 over the entire night.

The times recorded on the CONCAM frames are behind the actual
UT time by about 60 seconds.  We have corrected for this in 
this report so that the uncertainty in the above reported 
times is only about 2 seconds.
