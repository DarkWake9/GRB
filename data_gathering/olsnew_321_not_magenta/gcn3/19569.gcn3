Using the data set from T-240 to T+581 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160624A (trigger #701288)
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 19560).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 330.210, 29.667 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  22h 00m 50.5s
  Dec(J2000) = +29d 40' 02.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single pulse that starts at ~T0,
peaks at ~T+0.1 s, and ends at ~T+0.3. T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.2 +- 0.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.0 to T+0.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.57 +- 0.45.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.0 +- 0.9 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.29 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
