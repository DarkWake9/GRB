We observed the position of GRB 140709A (GCN 16546) at 15 GHz with
the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on 2014 July 11.93 to
12.10 UT, corresponding to 2.88 days post-burst. We have detected a
possible radio counterpart consistent with the UVOT-enhanced XRT position
(GCN 16548) with a preliminary flux of 0.35 +/- 0.06 mJy. However, this
source is blended with the nearby NVSS source 201841+511349 lying
at an angular distance of 27.5 arcseconds. The angular resolution of AMI
is ~30 arcseconds. The flux was calculated by first subtracting the contribution
from the NVSS source.
Earlier AMI observations an 2014 July 9.05 to 9.14 UT and July 10.04 to 10.2,
corresponding to <5 minutes and 1 day post-burst, did not detect a radio source
at the position of the GRB with 3 sigma upper limits of 0.30 and 0.21 mJy, respectively.
Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
