Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130521A (trigger #556344)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 14691).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 87.568, 14.470 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  05h 50m 16.3s
    Dec(J2000) = +14d 28' 10.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at T-2 sec, peaking
at T+0 sec and falling to near background by T+4 sec, followed by a weak tail
out to approximately T+12 sec.  At around T+120 sec, the source moved out of the 
field of view due to a pre-planned slew to another target. T90 (15-350 keV) is 
11.0 +- 2.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.64 to T+12.64 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.11 +- 0.20.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.2 +- 0.5 x 10^-07 
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV 
band is 1.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
