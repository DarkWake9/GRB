GRB030706 was detected by Konus-Wind at 00:02:15.262 UT
and Helicon-Coronas-F at 00:02:17.053 UT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 85.881 deg,
Decl(2000) = 21.043 deg,
Radius = 62.2 +/- 1.9 degrees (3 sigma ).
This annulus intersects the IPN annulus (GCN 2292) to form two
error boxes, only one of which has the correct ecliptic latitude.
Preliminary 3 sigma error box has approximate area of 1200 sq. arcmin :
