J. Kemp (Joint Astronomy Centre and Columbia) report for the
MDM GRB follow-up team:

"We observed the optical afterglow (Fox, GCN #1564) of GRB 021004 with
the MDM 1.3m in BVRI.  On 2002 Oct 5 UT, we measure the following
preliminary magnitudes:

		--------------------

We employed the Weidinger et al. (GCN #1573) revised calibration star.
These measurements are consistent with and extend the steepening light
curve that they saw.  The combined NOT and MDM points indicate a decay
slope alpha = 1.16 +/- 0.07, but there are possible fluctuations of the
type referred to by Winn et al. (GCN #1576) in our data that are
contemporaneous with theirs.

An updated decay curve is available at:

An equal number of images in each of B, V, and I were obtained, and will
be analyzed subsequently."
