E. Berger (Princeton/OCIW) and P. Challis (CfA) report:

"We re-observed the BAT error circle of the short GRB 071112B (GCN 7071) 
with LDSS3 on the Magellan/Clay telescope.  A total of 1200 sec were 
obtained in the i-band in 0.8" seeing starting about 30 hours after the 
burst.  A comparison to our first epoch of imaging taken about 6 hours 
after the burst (GCN 7075) reveals no variable sources to a conservative 
limit of about 23.5 mag.  Further analysis is in progress."
