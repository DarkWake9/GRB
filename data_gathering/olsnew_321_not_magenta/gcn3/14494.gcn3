D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al.; GCN 14448) with 
the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy on two epochs on 
2013-04-28 (UT), between 01:45 and 02:46 and again between 07:22 and 
08:14, at a frequency of 93 GHz (3 mm).  The afterglow is well-detected 
in both epochs.  Preliminary reduction gives fluxes of:

3.7 +/- 0.4 mJy  (t_mid = 0.769 day)
2.6 +/- 0.4 mJy  (t_mid = 1.000 day)

These values are consistent with the flux reported by Zauderer et al. 
(GCN 14482) as also measured by CARMA at a time intermediate between 
these epochs.

The source location is:

RA = 11:32:32.82
Dec = +27:41:56.06
(J2000, uncertainty 0.4 arcsec)

Further observations are planned.

We thank the CARMA staff for their support in executing these observations.
