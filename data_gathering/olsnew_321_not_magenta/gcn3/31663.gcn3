Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 02:21:16.664 UTC on 22 February 2022
(http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/flight/1329531683/index.html).
The burst signal was seen only by the SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a single weak pulse which starts at T+1.3 sec,
peaks at T+2.4 sec,and ends at T+3.0 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 1.5 +- 0.4 sec and 0.6 +- 0.5 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
