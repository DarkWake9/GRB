"
At 02:32:58.60 UT on 20 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200420 (trigger 609042783 / 200420106).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA =
304.6, Dec = -20.3
(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 18m, -20d 16'), with a statistical
uncertainty of 27.3 degrees.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 11.0 degrees.
