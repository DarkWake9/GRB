Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140502A (trigger #597841)
(Swenson, et al., GCN Circ. 16202).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 319.172, 48.975 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 16m 41.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +48d 58' 28.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 99%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-shaped peak starting at ~T-3 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
16.9 +- 1.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.66 to T+17.39 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.22 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.7 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
