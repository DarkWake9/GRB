The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 17:07:07 UT on 10 Feb 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210210B (trigger 634669632.657458 / 210210713).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 205.2, Dec = 17.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 40m, 17d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 40.0 degrees.
