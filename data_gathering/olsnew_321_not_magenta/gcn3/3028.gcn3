N. Tanvir, R. Priddey, M. Hughes, S. Pak, R. Chapman (U. Hertfordshire),
P. O'Brien, A. Levan (U. Leicester), C. Simpson (U. Durham),
T. Carroll (JACH) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the Swift/BAT position reported for GRB 050215B
with the UFTI camera on UKIRT in good seeing.  The exposure was in
the K98 filter beginning at Feb 15.51 UT (9.76 hours post burst).

We find no sources apart from the bright 2MASS star (catalogued
position 11 37 46.50 +40 47 58.2) within 15 arcsec of the Swift/XRT
position reported by Page et al. (GCN circular 3027), down to a
limiting K-band magnitude of approx 20.5 (5 sigma).

Preliminary standard star calibration gives a magnitude for the
2MASS star of K=15.4 compared to a catalogued value of 15.22.
