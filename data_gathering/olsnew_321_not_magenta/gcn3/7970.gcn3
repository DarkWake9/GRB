D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley) and C. Melis (UCLA) report:

On the night of 2008-07-10 starting at 10:32:30 UT, we began a series of 
IR exposures with the Lick Shane 3 meter telescope, equipped with the 
GEMINI IR imager.  We acquired imaging in J and K' filters 
simultaneously between 10:32 and 10:44.  We returned to the field during 
morning twilight and took additional imaging between 12:19 and 12:25 in 
H and K' simultaneously.

Calibrating to two nearby 2MASS stars, we estimate a preliminary 
magnitude in the first epoch J-band imaging of:

J = 16.24 +/- 0.05

between 10:32 and 10:44 (mid-time of 206 minutes after the GRB.)

The GRB afterglow displays tentative evidence of brightening over the 
exposure period.  Additional analysis is ongoing.
