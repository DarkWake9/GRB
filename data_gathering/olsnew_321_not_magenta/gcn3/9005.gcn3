D. C.-J. Bock (CARMA), P. Chandra (RMC), D. A. Frail (NRAO), and S. R. 
Kulkarni (Caltech)
 report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of view of GRB 090313 (GCN 8980) with the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) at a frequency of
92.5 GHz at the mean observation time of 2009 March 14, 0930 UT, within a
day of detection by the Swift. We detect the GRB at the KAIT optical 
afterglow
position (GCN 8979) with a flux density of 4.0+/-0.6 mJy.  The map rms 
noise
is 0.17 mJy.

We acknowledge excellent support from the staff and observers at CARMA."
