S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have observed the location of the Swift GRB131018A (Melandri et al.,
GCN 15349) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Two 60 s frames
were obtained before the telescope closed due to the imminent sunrise.  We
find no new sources within the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN
15352).  Using nearby point sources from SDSS for photometric calibration,
we the following upper limits:

r' > 20.1 mag at 12:56 UT (dt = 8.6 min)
i' > 19.5 mag at 12:58 (dt = 10.0 min)
