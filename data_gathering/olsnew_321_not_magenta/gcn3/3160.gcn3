N. Gehrels (GSFC), J. A. Nousek (PSU), S. Barthelmy (GSFC), D. N. Burrows, 
P.  Roming (PSU), report on behalf of the Swift team:

The Swift team reported three GRBs earlier today, but has now determined 
that all of these triggers (BAT triggers 112977, 112981, and 112982; GCN 
Circulars #3155, 3156, 3157, 3158) were due to Vela X-1.  The positions 
were assigned incorrectly due to attitude errors on the spacecraft.  All of 
these triggers are being retracted.  Swift has not found a true GRB yet today.
