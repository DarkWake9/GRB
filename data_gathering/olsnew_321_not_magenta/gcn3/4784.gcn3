N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) reports on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB 
follow-up team:

"I observed the candidate optical afterglow of Swift GRB 060218 detected
by the Swift UVOT (Cusumano et al. GCN #4775, Marshall et al. GCN #4779, 
Quimby et al. GCN #4782) with the MDM 2.4m telescope and RETROCAM imager 
under partly cloudy conditions. Calibration with SDSS pre-burst 
observations (Cool et al. GCN #4777) yields r = 17.55 +/- 0.1 on Feb. 
19.1438 UT for the OT. This is brighter than the pre-burst observations 
and confirms it as the OT of GRB 060218."
