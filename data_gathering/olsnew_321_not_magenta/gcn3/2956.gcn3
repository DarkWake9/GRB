K. Torii (Osaka University) reports:

 The error region of SWIFT GRB 050117 (Burrows, et al. GCN 2951;
Sakamoto, et al. GCN 2952) was observed with the 14-inch ART at Osaka
University. The observation started at 2005 January 17, 14:05 UT and a
sequence of 60-s exposures in B, V, Rc, and Ic was repeated.

 We note that Galactic extinction is severe in the burst direction
(E(B-V) = 1.7 or A_R = 4.6 according to Schlegel, et al. 1998) and
compared our stacked Ic-band frame (60-s x 10 frames, mean epoch 14:38
UT) with the USNO-A2.0 (R) magnitude. As a result of the preliminary
analysis, no new source brighter than about 17.5 mag is identified
within the refined XRT error region (Hill, et al. GCN 2955).
