ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB  
080319B (Swift trigger 306757; Racusin et al., GCN 7427) and began  
imaging at 06:13:11.06 UT  (5.3 sec after the GCN notice time) under  
suboptimal conditions, because of condensation present on the CCD.  
Observations continued until about 5 hours after the trigger.  This  
condensation made the analysis very difficult, but we detect the OT  
first reported in GCN 7428.  Further analysis is ongoing.  These  
unfiltered images are calibrated to the USNO B1.0 R2 catalog.
