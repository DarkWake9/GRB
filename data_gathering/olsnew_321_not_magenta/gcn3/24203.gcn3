Scott Barthelmy (NASA-GSFC):

A problem was discovered in the GCN Circulars processing.
If a submitted circular has control-M's in the text
then they are no longer removed due to a change to faster mail agent
about 10 days ago.  The old mail agent fixed those embedded characters.
But the new mail agent is 2.3 times faster -- the speed increase
was the desirable goal because of the ever increasing number
of recipients in the Circulars distribution list (now 1700+).

The fix has been found (with off-line testing),  but I am hesitant
to switch over to it so late in the day (late for east coast US time).
So I am reverting back to the previous (and slower) mail agent.
Then switchover to the fixed version (that handles the control-M's
and is faster) will happen tomorrow (26-Apr-2019).
