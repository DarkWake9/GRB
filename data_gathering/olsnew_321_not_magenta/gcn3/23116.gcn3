The long, bright GRB 180809B (Swift-BAT trigger #852553: Moss et al.,
GCN Circ. 23105) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
at 20:28:41.478 UTC on 9 August 2018 while exiting the radiation belts.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows the main multi-peaked emission episode which
starts at T-5 sec, peaks at T+41.4 sec, and ends at T+79.9 sec, followed by
a weaker pulse which starts at T+210.0 sec and ends at T+254.6 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
227.6 +- 5.4 sec and 28.3 +- 5.7 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.
Since the CGBM HV was set to its nominal value at T-21 sec for
the HXM1 and HXM2 detectors and at T-5 sec for the SGM detector,
CGBM was blind to a possible earlier emission.

the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
