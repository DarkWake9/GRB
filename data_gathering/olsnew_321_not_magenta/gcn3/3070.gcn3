on behalf of Konus-Wind and Helicon/Coronas-F teams, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

SGR-like burst 050304 was detected by Konus-Wind
at 10:17:14.537 UT and Helicon-Coronas-F at 10:17:17.941 UT.
We have triangulated it to an annulus centered at
RA(2000) = 321.683 deg, Decl(2000) = -15.478 deg,
whose radius is 47.167 ± 0.092 deg (3 sigma).
As the center line of this annulus passes 0.033 degrees (1.1 sigma)
from the position of SGR 1806-20
and the Konus ecliptic latitude response indicates
that the source of the burst is near ecliptic plane,
we conclude that this burst originated from SGR 1806-20.

The burst had a duration of 0.13 sec,
fluence 7.9x10-7 erg cm-2, and peak flux
8.7x10-6 erg cm-2 s-1, both in 20-200 keV range.
The time-integrated spectrum of the burst can be fitted by the OTTB
spectral model:
dN/dE ~ E^{-1} exp(-E/kT),
with kT = 22 ± 1 keV.


Since the giant flare on 2004 December 27,
Konus-Wind and/or Helicon-Coronas-F has detected
10 SGR-like bursts in the trigger mode,
probably originated from SGR 1806-20.
