E. O. Ofek, S. B. Cenko, A. Gal-Yam (Caltech), B. Peterson, B. P.
Schmidt, (ANU), D. B. Fox (Penn State), and P. A. Price (IfA, Hawaii)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the region of the 4s-duration GRB060505 (GCNs 5076; 5078;
5114; 5115) with the GMOS instrument on the Gemini South Telescope, in g'
and r'-bands, on 2006 May 6.4 and on 2006 May 12.3.
Inspection of single g' and r'-band images from each night reveals the
presence of a variable source 4."3 from the z=0.089 galaxy 2dFGRS
S173Z112 (7kpc in projection). The afterglow coordinates are:

           22:07:03.44 -27:48:51.9   (J2000.0)

relative to the USNO-A2.0 catalog.
The OT is found 6" from the nominal XRT coordinates
(which have 4."7 uncertainty, 90% confidence).

On 2006 May 6.40, the g'-band magnitude of the proposed afterglow was
g~21.5,
and on 2006 May 12.31 it was g'~22 (Compared to USNO-A2.0).

We further inspected the publicly available 2dF spectra
of the z=0.089 galaxy 2dFGRS S173Z112, found within the XRT error circle
of GRB 060505 (GCN 5078).
The spectra shows prominent emission lines of Halpha, Hbeta, OI, OII, OIII
and SII. In absorption we detect the G-band and the CaII H line (but not
the K line). The spectrum suggests this is a late type galaxy.
