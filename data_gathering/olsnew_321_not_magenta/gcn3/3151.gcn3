J. M. Castro Cerón (Univ. of Copenhagen, Denmark) and
Ph. Yock (Univ. of Auckland, New Zealand) report:

We have imaged the error box provided by Swift (trigger
112453, GCN 3147) with the 0.6m telescope (+MOA camera)
at Mt.John Observatory. A 600s second integration taken
at 16:47:45 UT (ie. 6.90 hours after burst, mean obs.
time) reveals no apparent source down to limiting mag.
20.3 in comparison with DSS. Observation was performed 
with MOA broad R-band filter (similar to Ic).
