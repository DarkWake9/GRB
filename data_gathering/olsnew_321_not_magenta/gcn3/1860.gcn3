A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 20x20 arcmin field covering the eastern two thirds of
the IPN error box for GRB030204 (Hurley, et. al GCN 1584)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=12.5 are saturated and should be used with care.
Conditions were clear but with poor seeing; estimated external
zeropoint error is about 0.03mag.  We have placed the photometric
data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030204.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

We do not anticipate additional nights of photometry on
this field since no afterglow has been detected.  However,
as with all NOFS calibrations, check the dates on the
file prior to final publication to ensure that you have
the latest photometry.
