report:
 
"We have imaged a 30' x 30' region centred on the
INTEGRAL error box for GRB 020327 (Gotz et al. GCN
Circ. 1895, 1896) with the 2.5-m Isaac Newton
telescope at Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos
(Canary Islands, Spain). One B-band frame and one
R-band frame (600-s exposure time each) were obtained
on Feb 27.872 UT (i.e. 12.2 hours after the GRB) under
good meteorological conditions.  Within the X-ray source
error box given by XMM-Newton (Loiseau et al. GCN Circ.
1901) we find a point-like object (R = 22.5 preliminarly)
which is also marginally detected in the B-band frame.
Coordinates yield AR(2000) = 04 57 33.05, Dec(2000)
= +20 29 03.5 (preliminary, +/- 1"). Further observations
are needed to confirm whether this object is the optical
afterglow to GRB 030227.  The object reported by Ofek and
Gal-Yam (GCN Circ.  1903) is also detected in our images
with R about 21.5.  An image of the field is posted at:
www.iaa.csic.es/~ajct/GRBs/grb030227."
