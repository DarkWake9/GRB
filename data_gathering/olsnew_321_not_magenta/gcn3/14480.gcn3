B. A. Zauderer, E. Berger, S. Chakraborti, and A. Soderberg (Harvard)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the position of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al.; GCN 14448)
beginning 2013 Apr 27.99 (dt = 0.67 d) with the Very Large Array in its
D configuration (synthesized beam ~18'' x 11'').  At a mean frequency of 
~5.8 GHz, we detect a source with a flux of ~1 mJy +/- 20 uJy at a
position consistent with the optical afterglow (e.g. Elenin et al., 
Perley et al.; GCNs 14450, 14451). Followup observations are planned for 
this nearby z~0.34 GRB (Levan et al., Xu et al; GCNs 14455, 14478).

We thank the VLA observatory staff for their support of these observations."
