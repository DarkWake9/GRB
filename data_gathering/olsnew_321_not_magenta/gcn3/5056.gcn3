MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded
to GRB060502B (GRB_TIME is 2006-05-02 17:24:41.07, E. Troja  et al. 
GCN5055) by unfiltered, BVR-filtered, spectral and high time 
resolution cameras.

The first image was at 2006-05-02 17:25:50.11 UT,
69 s  after the GRB time on the bright evening sky.
The first images with more or less good limit was at 82 min  after the GRB 
time at high air mass.

The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
The robot not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  16.0 (s/n=5) 
at Swift XRT position.
