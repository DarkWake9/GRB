A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) and A.P. Kamble (University of
Amsterdam) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We reobserved the position of the GRB 090313 afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at March 20 18.89 UT to March 21
6.88 UT, i.e. 7.41 - 7.91 days after the burst (GCN 8980).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 165 +/- 30 microJy at the
position of the optical counterpart (GCN 8979).

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for scheduling and obtaining these
observations."
