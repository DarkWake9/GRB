SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021125B (two large error boxes)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, and

V. Schoenfelder, A. Rau, A. v. Kienlin, G. Lichti G., N. Arend, J.-P.
Roques, J. Burkowski, R. Walter, and N. Produit, on behalf of the
INTEGRAL GRB team, report:

The Konus ecliptic latitude response constrains the arrival
direction of this burst (GCN 1710) to those portions of the
annulus ( RA, Decl(2000)= 2.237, -35.258 degrees, radius 85.862 +/-  0.017
degrees, 3 sigma) which lie between RA, Decl = 99.3, -16.9 and 125.3, -43.4
degrees, and between RA, Decl = 148.5, -54.2 and 210.7, -55.6 degrees. 

As this event was observed by INTEGRAL, it may eventually be possible
to constrain the annulus further.
