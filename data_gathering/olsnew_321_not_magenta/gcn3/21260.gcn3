behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:06:54 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered 
(trigger=758005) on what appears to be noise during the count rate 
rise associated with entry into the SAA.  The image significance 
is low (5.8 sigma) and there is no significant peak in the light 
curve.  Thus we believe that this trigger is not due to a GRB or
other astrophysical event. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:08:11.4 UT, 76.8 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart.
