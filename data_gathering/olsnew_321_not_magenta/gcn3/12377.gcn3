SUBJECT: GRB 110921A : TNT optical counterpart candidate

C. Wu, X. H. Han on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB 110921A (Baumgartner et al., GCN 12373)
with Xinglong TNT telescope at 13:59:40 (UT), about 8 min  after 
the burst.  25 White-band images and a series of R-band data were obtained. 
A new source was detected in the combined white band image within 
the errorbox of XRT position. The brightness of this new source is estimated 
to be about 20.2 mag derived from USNO B1.0 R2mag. 

We propose that this source is the candidate of optical 
counterpart of GRB 110921A.
More deep observations are needed to confirm this.
