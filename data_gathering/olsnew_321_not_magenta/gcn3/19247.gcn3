J. Wren, W.T. Vestrand, P. Wozniak, and H. Davis,

of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:


The RAPTOR network of robotic optical telescops made observations of Swift

trigger 680655 (Racusin, et al., GCN 19235).  Our Raptor-S telescope began

imaging at 09:16:27.58 UT, 19.9 s after the Swift trigger time.  We do not

detect the optical counterpart reported by RATIR (Golkhou, et al., GCN 19236).

We derive the following 3-sigma limits for our unfiltered observations based

on comparison to the USNO-B1.0 catalog R-band.
