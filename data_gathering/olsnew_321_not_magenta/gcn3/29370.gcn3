Evans (U. Leicester) and J.R. Cummings report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team: report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 4.5 ks of XRT data for the Fermi/GBM-detected burst
GRB 140402A (Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 16071), from 32.8 ks to 51.2 ks
after the  Fermi/GBM trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. The refined XRT position is RA, Dec = 207.5986, +5.7744
which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 13 50 23.67
Dec(J2000): +05 46 28.0

with an uncertainty of 5.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 9.6 arcmin from the Fermi/GBM position.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020373.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
