We have observed the field of GRB070920B (Racusin et al.,
GCNC 6808) using the 2.5m NOT telescope (+ALFOSC) at
Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in V, R and I bands
(180 s each) at high airmass. The mean time of the
observations was 21.0486 Sep. 2007 (UT), ~4.1 hours after
the burst.  We do not detect any bright afterglow candidate
within the Swift/BAT error box.
However, we do see a red, stationary object (detected in R
and I bands) slightly over the DSS2 limit that does not seem
to have its correspondent in the DSS2 images. The
coordinates of this object are (J2000 +/- 0.5"):

R.A.: 00:00:34.56
Dec.: -34:49:08.4

Further observations are needed to confirm wether this could
be the optical afterglow of GRB 070920B.
