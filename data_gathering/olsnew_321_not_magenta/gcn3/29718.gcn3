The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:59:58 UT on 24 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210324C (trigger 638308803.321686 / 210324833).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 37.6, Dec = -46.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 02h 30m, -46d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 37.0 degrees.
