S. Bradley Cenko, Alicia M. Soderberg (Caltech) and Derek B. Fox (Penn
State) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB 051006 (Norris et al., GCN 4061) with
the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations consisted of 10 x
150 s R-band images taken at a mean epoch of approximately 9:20, 7
October UT (12.9 hours after the burst).  In a co-addition of our
images, we find no new sources inside the refined XRT error circle
(Capalbi et al., GCN 4066).  Using several Guide Star Catalog sources in
the field, we estimate our limiting magnitude to be R > 21.0.  

In particular, we do not detect source #3 identified by de Ugarte et al.
(GCN 4064) to the magnitude limit quoted above.
