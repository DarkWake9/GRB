INTEGRAL SPI-ACS team report:

Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, and Suzaku-WAM observed the bright short
hard GRB 090227B at about 18:31:00 UT (corresponding to the Fermi/GBM
trigger 257452263 / 090227772: Guiriec, GCN 8921).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~0.2 sec.

Triangulation gives a Konus-WAM annulus centered at RA(2000)=336.619
(22h 26m 29s) Dec(2000)=-16.013 (-16d 00' 46"), whose radius is 56.968
±0.097 deg (3 sigma), and a Konus-SPI-ACS annulus centered at
RA(2000)=337.423 (22h 29m 42s) Dec(2000)= -19.538 (-19d 32' 16"), whose
radius is  59.273 ± 0.224 deg (3sigma). These annuli intersect at
grazing incidence to form two long error boxes, one of which may be
eliminated by the GBM location (Guiriec, GCN 8921).
The resulting error box has the coordinates:
-----------------------------------------------------
       RA(2000), deg              Dec(2000), deg
-----------------------------------------------------
Center:
    13.499 (00h 54m 00s)   +28.401 (+28d 24' 05")
Corners:
    8.168 (00h 32m 40s)   +32.167 (+32d 10' 02")
   11.644 (00h 46m 34s)   +30.005 (+30d 00' 20")
   17.745 (01h 10m 59s)   +24.579 (+24d 34' 44")
   15.181 (01h 00m 43s)   +26.796 (+26d 47' 46")
-----------------------------------------------------

The error box area is 1.531 sq. deg.

This error box may be improved.

We have also derived a Konus-GBM annulus for the burst which is fully 
consistent with the Konus-WAM annulus.

The GBM location is consistent with the IPN box.
The center of the GBM location lies 1.830 deg from the Konus-WAM annulus
and 4.041 deg from the center of the box.
You can find the GBM confidence contours overplotted on the IPN box at 
the IPN triangulation map. The contours should be considered as 
preliminary and we expect the GBM localization code will be
refined. No systematic error has been added.
