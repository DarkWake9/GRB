R. Marcinkowski (PSI), H.L. Xiao (PSI) and W. Hajdas (PSI) report on behalf
of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-02-02 07:19:54 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, 
POLAR detected long GRB 170202B, which was also observed by Konus at 
07:19:54.107 UT.

The POLAR light curve consists of multi peak structure with duration 
(T90) of 23.0 +/- 0.5 s measured from T0. The 0.5 s peak flux at 
T0 + 4.8 s  is equal to 5000 +/- 120 counts/sec. POLAR recorded about
29700 events from the burst.
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 20 - 500 keV.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary. Calibration of the
instrument is ongoing. POLAR is a dedicated Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which
was launched on-board the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on
Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
