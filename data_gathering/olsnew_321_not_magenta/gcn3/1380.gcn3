D. A. Frail (Caltech/NRAO), M. H. Wieringa (ATNF), E. Berger
(Caltech), and R. Wark (ATNF) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Beginning on 2002 April 23 at 8:00 UT we observed a region centered
on the position of the fading X-ray source reported by Nicastro et al.
(GCN #1374) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 8.7
GHz. An image made of the entire error circle (20-arcsec radius) shows
no radio sources above a 4-sigma level of 200 microJy.

This message may be cited."
