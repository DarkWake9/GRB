The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:14:43 UT on 28 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200228B (trigger 604581288.894278 / 200228469).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 258.4, Dec = 9.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 13m, 9d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 16.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
