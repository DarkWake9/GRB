We observed the Swift GRB 140629A field (Lien et al., GCNC 16477) using
1.04m ST telescope at ARIES Nainital. Observations were started at 17:40:59
UT on 2014-06-29 (approximately 3.4 h after the burst). Several frames
with an exposure time of 300 s each in R_c and I_c bands were obtained in

good sky conditions.

The optical counterpart of GRB 140629A (Lien et al., GCNC 16477;

Yurkov et al., GCNC 16478; Bikmaev et al., GCNC 16482; Masi, GCNC

16483; ) is clearly detected  in each individual frames.


Preliminary photometry is following:
-----------------------------------------------
   UT          Exp_time     Filter     Mag

------------------------------------------------

17:40:59       300 s         R_c     18.01  +- 0.05

17:56:21       300 s         I_c       17.92 +- 0.06
