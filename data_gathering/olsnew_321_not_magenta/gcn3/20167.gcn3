E. Mazaeva (IKI), A. Kusakin (Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute),  I. 
Reva (Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute), A. Volnova (IKI), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 161108A  (Beardmore et al., GCN 20145) with 
Zeiss-1000 (East) 1-m telescope of Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory. 
We obtained several images in R filter starting on Nov. 09 (UT) 
22:52:14. Within enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al., GCN 20147) we 
detected the afterglow of GRB 161014A (Malesani et al., GCN 20146; 
Butler et al., GCN 20149). Preliminary photometry of the afterglow is 
following

Date       UT start   t-T0   Filter   Exp.   OT   Err.  UL

2016-11-09 22:52:14   1.83762  R      41*120 22.0 0.24  22.2

The photometry of the afterglow might be  affected by nearby galaxy 
mentioned in GCN 20149 (Malesani et al.)

Photometry is based on nearby SDSS-DR9 stars (Mazaeva et al., GCN 20160).
