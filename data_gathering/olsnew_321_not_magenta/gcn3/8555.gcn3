Gendre B. (LAM-OAMP), Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP),
Boer M. (OHP-OAMP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 081126 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 335647) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 20.6s after the GRB trigger
(6.9s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased
from 41 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were very good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-11-26T21:34:10

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT at the XRT position (Margutti et al. 2008
GCNC 8554) with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+20.6s to t0+80.6s : R > 16.6

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+86.7s to t0+116.7s : R > 18.0

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon= 92.9 lat= -2.3
and the galactic extinction in R band is 2.1 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
