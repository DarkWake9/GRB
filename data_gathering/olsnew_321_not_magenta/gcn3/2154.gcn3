report:

The error box of GRB030416 (HETE Ground Analysis, TRIGGER_NUM:10897) was
observed with MASTER system (280mm, http://observ.pereplet.ru). We
obtained 25 measurements in R filter. Our observations started at Apr 17,
17h56m37s UT (33 hours after the GRB) and  had been lasting for 4.0 hours
up to Apr 17, 21h57m17s UT (37 hours after  the  GRB).

 We had very poor transparancy and full Moon at all time, so flux
measurements  uncertanities were quite big.

There is no OT brighter that 15.0 (R-band) in error box.
