A. Corsi (Texas Tech U.) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of GRB 141109A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 17037) with the 
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in K-band at about 7.5 hours after the burst. 
A provisional reduction shows a source consistent with the location of the GRB NIR, 
optical, and X-ray afterglows (e.g., Covino et al., GCN 17039; Xu et al., GCN 17040; 
Osborne et al. GCN 17043).  At this time, we estimate a preliminary flux of about 
142 uJy at 21.8 GHz. The map rms is about 9.3 uJy.

Further observations are ongoing.
