(XAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 140304A (Evans et al., GCN 15915) using
the 1m telescope located in Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations
started at 13:43:26 UT on 2014-03-04 (i.e., 0.349 hr after the BAT
trigger) and a series of 120s and 500s R-band images were obtained.

In the first 120s R-band image, an optical source is clearly detected
at the MASTER position (Gorbovskoy et al., GCN 15914), which is also
consistent with the Swift/XRT position. We thus think this is the
afterglow of the burst, and it has decayed to R=19.4+/-0.2 mag,
calibrated with nearby SDSS stars.

Observations are ongoing.
