(INAF-IASFPA) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the INTEGRAL-detected
burst GRB 160401A (Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 19251), collecting 2.9
ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+42.9 ks and T0+49.1 ks.


No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the INTEGRAL
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field ranges from ~0.003
to ~0.005 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
1.3e-13 to 1.9e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

Four uncatalogued sources were detected too far from the GRB position
to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020603.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
