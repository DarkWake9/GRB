(USRA at NASA/MSFC) report:
"R-band observations of the proposed OT to GRB971227 (Castro-Tirado 
et al., IAUC 6800) taken with the Kitt Peak 0.9m telescope at December 
29.53 UT and the 3.5m Apache Point Telescope at December 30.44 UT show this 
object at a constant level of R=20.4 +/- 0.1 mag, at a position 
RA=12h57m08.65s, Dec=+59d24'40" (J2000).  It is 1.4 magnitudes fainter than a 
relatively bright (R=19.0) star located at RA=12h57m04.8s, Dec=+59d24'42.0" 
(J2000).  Both object appear in the Digital Sky Survey with a relative 
magnitude difference comparable to this value.  In the Apache Point 
image the source appears to be slightly extended, which indicates it may be 
a galaxy.   
No object in the SAX NFI errorbox (Piro et al., IAUC 6797) appears to
vary at a level of more than 0.3 mag, down to a limiting magnitude of R=21.5".
