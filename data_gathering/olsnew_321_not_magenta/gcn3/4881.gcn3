The GRB 060313 (Swift-BAT trigger #201487;
Pagani et al., GCN 4867; Markwardt et al., GCN 4873)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=726.354 s UT (00:12:06.354).

The Konus-Wind light shows several multipeaked
pulses with a total duration of ~0.8 sec.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst had
a fluence of 1.42(-0.85, +0.10)x10^-5 erg/cm2 and
peak flux on 16-ms time scale measured from T-T0=0.560 sec
7.0(-4.3, +1.0)x10^-5 erg/cm2/sec
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the GRB
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha) * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Ep)
with alpha = 0.60(-0.22, +0.19)
and Ep = 922(-177, +306) keV (chi2 = 62/59 dof).

The fitting of the spectrum of the GRB initial part
(accumulated from T-T0=0 to T-T0=0.192 sec in
the same energy range)
gives an unusual photon index alpha:
alpha = -0.33(-0.29, +0.25)
Ep = 655(-74, +84)
(chi2 = 51/59 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
