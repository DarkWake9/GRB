Using the data set from T-239 to T+823 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 201017A (trigger #1000613)
D'Ai, et al., GCN Circ. 28666).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 36.587, 66.663 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 26m 20.9s 
  Dec(J2000) = +66d 39' 45.7" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, symmetrical main peak from roughly
T-5 sec to T+5 sec, peaking at T+1 sec, followed by weaker emission out to T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 22.08 +- 6.25 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.77 to T+23.87 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.48 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 9.0 +- 1.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.87 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.8 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
