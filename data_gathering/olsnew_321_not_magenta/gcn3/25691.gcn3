Dougal Dobie (University of Sydney/CSIRO), Emil Lenc (CSIRO),
Ian Brown (UWM),Tara Murphy (University of Sydney), Adam Stewart
(University of Sydney), David Kaplan (UWM), Kunal Mooley (Caltech),
Gregg Hallinan (Caltech) and the OzGrav, JAGWAR and GROWTH collaborations.

We observed ASKAP J005547.4-270433/AT2019osy (GCN 25487) with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2019 September 6
from 12:30-19:30 UT.

We report flux densities of:
  380+/-21 uJy at 5.0 GHz
  353+/-17 uJy at 6.0 GHz
  299+/-14 uJy at 8.5 GHz
  234+/-14 uJy at 9.5 GHz

Which are consistent with the measurements obtained with the ATCA on
2019 August 29, 8 days prior (GCN 25487, GCN 25621, GCN 25539). Therefore
the previously observed variability is unlikely to be related to S190814bv.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
