TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1460
SUBJECT: GRB020331: Late-time Optical Light Curve (re-submission)

FROM:    Alicia Soderberg at Caltech  <ams@astro.caltech.edu>

In the previous submission (GCN 1459), there is a misprint
in the table of magnitudes.  We report the correct values below.
The revised version of the GCN follows:

    HST Epoch   T (days since burst)     R (mag)
       1        23.9                     24.54 +/- 0.07
       2        36.6                     24.86 +/- 0.10
       3        42.7                     25.01 +/- 0.09
       4        49.3                     24.76 +/- 0.11

"We have observed the optical afterglow associated with GRB 020331
(GCN 1334) with HST+STIS (Clear) at four epochs spanning the period
25-50 days following the burst (one orbit per epoch).

Registration of the STIS data against ground-based images allows us to
identify the afterglow amidst a complex of at least three galaxies,
including the presumed host galaxy which lies under the afterglow
itself.  Aperture photometry on the optical transient + host yields
the following R-equivalent magnitudes for the four epochs:

    HST Epoch   T (days since burst)     R (mag)
       1        23.9                     24.54 +/- 0.07
       2        36.6                     24.86 +/- 0.10
       3        42.7                     25.01 +/- 0.09
       4        49.3			 24.76 +/- 0.11

We have derived our R-equivalent magnitudes by assuming
(R-Clear)=-0.67 as given by the STIS Exposure Time Calculator for
a source with power-law spectrum (index=-1).
The first three epochs imply a power-law flux decay index over this
interval with index alpha=0.75, compatible with previous ground-based
estimates (Ricker et al., GCN 1382).

Preliminary analysis of the fourth epoch, T=50 days, indicates a
rebrightening of the optical afterglow by 0.2 +/- 0.1 mag as compared
with our Epoch 3.  We have requested additional HST observations to
help us clarify whether this rebrightening is statistically significant.
