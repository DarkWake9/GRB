Using the data set from T-239 to T+250 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 180905A (trigger #859421)
(D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 23201).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 91.038, -4.592 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  06h 04m 09.2s
  Dec(J2000) = -04d 35' 31.9"
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 29%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak long pulse that starts
at ~T-60 s and ends at ~T+150 s. Note that the burst came into the BAT
field of view at T-84 s, and BAT entered the SAA after ~ T+250 s. Therefore,
there might be additional burst emission before and after the available event
data range. T90 (15-350 keV) is 165.3 +- 28.9 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-58.9 to T+146.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.60 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-2.09 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
