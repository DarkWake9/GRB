J.French (UCD Dublin), P.Kubanek (AsU AV CR Ondrejov & ISDC Versoix), 
and Martin Jelinek (IAA Granada) report on behalf of the Watcher 
collaboration:

The Watcher 0.4 m telescope, located at the Boyden Observatory, South
Africa, began observing the location of GRB 060912B at 17:34:44 UT (60s
after the burst). We detect a bright source (Rmag = 12.1+/-0.2) at RA 
18:05:00.005, DEC -19:51:42.37 J2000, which is present in USNO-B1.0 (as 
U0675_24058876 with coordinate end figures 0.005 and 42.37), but 
significantly brighter than expected. Unfiltered images, calibrated 
relative to USNO, give an approximate Rmag = 12.1+/-0.2 for the source, 
as opposed to the value of 14.4 quoted in the catalog. The object is not 
present in Simbad as a known variable star.

We do not, however, expect that this source is associated with GRB 
060912B due to the absence of significant decay up to T0+4hrs. Finding 
charts can be found at: http://bermuda.ucd.ie/~jfrench/060912/charts.html
