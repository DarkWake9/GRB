report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S191222n at T0 = 2019-12-22
03:35:37.119 (UT) a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0
shows that the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered
the 38% of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR) (19% of the LR was
occulted by Earth).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV on T0, where good exposure of the S191222n 90% c.l. LR
was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are obtained:
from 7.8e-07 to 4e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 38% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0 -2s ; T0 + 2s );
from 3.2e-07 to 1.6e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 38% of
the LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 10s );
from 3.4e-08 to 3.5e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 42% of
the LR over the time interval ( T0s ; T0 + 100s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
