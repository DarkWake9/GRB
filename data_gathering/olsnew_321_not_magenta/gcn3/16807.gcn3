The short-duration GRB 140906C (IPN triangulation: Golenetskii et al.,
GCN 16801 and Hurley et al., GCN 16805) triggered Konus-Wind
at T0=85872.815 s UT (23:51:12.815).

The burst light curve shows two peaks with a total duration of ~0.16 s. 
The emission is seen up to ~2 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB140906_T85872/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 2.2(-0.5,+0.6)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.064 s,
of 4.4(-1.4,+1.7)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+0.128 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a simple power law function with index = -1.76 (-0.11,+0.13)
(chi2 = 24.2/23 dof).
Fitting by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) yields the same alpha
and a lower limit on the Ep: Ep > 248 keV (chi2 = 22/22 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
