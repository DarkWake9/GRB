We have analysed 2.7 ks of XRT data for Fermi J1725.51312 (Buson et al.
GCN Circ. 28751). The data were taken in Photon Counting (PC) mode.
XRT observations establish a refined position for the
source: R.A. 17:23:14.09, Dec. +14:20:59.1, with a 90% containment
radius r_90 = 2.9".
The best-fit power-law spectrum has a photon index alpha = 1.5 (+0.8, -0.4)
and observed flux f_X = 6.5 (+3.1, -2.5) x 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1 (0.3-10 keV)
The observed flux is lower by a factor of 4 to 10 by comparison to its XMM
slew observation on 2006-09-04 (XMMSL2 J172313.9+142100, OsID:9123400002)

We do not claim this source as a counterpart to IceCube 201021A from these
observations.
