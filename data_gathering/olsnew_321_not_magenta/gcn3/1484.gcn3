G. Masi, F. Mallia and U. Tagliaferri (Campo Catino 
Astronomical Observatory, Italy) report:

On Aug. 13.859 2002 UT, we imaged the field of GRB020813 
(GCN 1471) with our 0.8-m, f/8 reflector + CCD, assuming 
the position provided by Henden et al. (GCN 1478).  We find
the optical afterglow candidate (Fox, et al., GCN 1470) to
be clearly visible, with an R magnitude (based on USNO A2.0)
around 19.5.  The astrometry, using about 200 reference
stars from USNO A2.0, gives the following position:

RA= 19 46 41.89  Decl: -19 36 04.6 (J2000.0)

Mean residuals= 0.2" in both axes.

The image will be available later today at our website: 
web.tiscalinet.it/aoccsite

The photometry will be improved when secondary standards
become available.
