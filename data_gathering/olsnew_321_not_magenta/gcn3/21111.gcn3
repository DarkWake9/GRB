(IAA-CSIC), Y. Qin (Geneva Observatory) report:

We observed the field of GRB 170519A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106) using 
the 1-m telescope located at Weihai, Shandong, China. We obtained 4x360s 
frames in the Sloan r-filter, starting at 11:52:54 UT on 2017-05-19, 
i.e., 6.71 hr after the burst.

The optical afterglow (Ukwatta et al., GCN 21106; Izzo et al., GCN 
21108) is clearly detected in our stacked image, and it has decayed to 
m(r) = 18.92 +/- 0.06 at 6.94 hr post-burst, calibrated with nearby SDSS 
stars.
