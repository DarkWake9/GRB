A possible short-duration GRB 151225A (trigger #1135105601) triggered the CALET 
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 19:09:10.34 UT on 25 December 2015.  The clear 
burst signal was detected by all three CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a double peak structure.  The initial spike 
starts and peaks around T0.  The second peak starts around T0+0.5 sec, peaks 
around T0+0.7 sec and ending around T0+1.5 sec.  Above 500 keV band, the first 
peak looks insignificant, instead the 2nd peak is clearly visible.  Based on the 
light curve inspection, the signal is clearly visible up to ~1.5 MeV.  Low energy 
data show no significant soft extended emission above ~7 keV.  The T90 duration 
measured by the SGM data is 1.87 +- 0.13 sec (40-450 keV).  

Identification of this possible short event by other spacecraft is strongly encouraged.
