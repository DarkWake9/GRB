On 2017 Aug 18.02 UT, we obtained an optical spectrum of the transient source SSS17a (RA = 13:09:48.09 DECL. = -23:22:53.35, Coulter et al. 2017; GCN 21529) possibly associated with LIGO/Virgo G298048, with the LDSS-3 spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan-Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.  The resulting spectrum shows a blue and featureless continuum between 4000 and 10,000 Angstroms, consistent with a power-law.

Additional observations are encouraged.
