D. K. Sahu (IIA), V. Bhalerao (IUCAA), G. C. Anupama (IIA) report:

We imaged iPTF14eag, the optical counterpart of GRB 140808A (Singer et al., GCN Circ. 16668; Zhang, GCN Circ. 16669), with the  2m. Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) ​ of the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, India. We obtained a total exposure of ​2700 sec in Bessell's R band, in the time range from UT 2014-08-08 15:37 to 16:38. The source was clearly detected with R = 20.6 +- 0.1. Combined with iPTF R band photometry (Singer et al., GCN Circ 16668), the decay fits a power law with slope -0.99 +- 0.02.

​We thank the iPTF team for alerting us about this burst.​
