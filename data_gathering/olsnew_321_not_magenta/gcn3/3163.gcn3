TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3163
SUBJECT: GRB 050401: Optical afterglow candidate

FROM:    Paul Price at IfA,UH  <price@ifa.hawaii.edu>

R. McNaught (RSAA, ANU) and P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

We have observed the XRT position of GRB 050401 (Swift trigger 113120)
with the 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring Observatory starting at
April 1.637 UTC.  In an unfiltered exposure of 120 sec, we identify a
source near the limiting magnitude of our observations, at approximate
coordinates:

	16:31:28.81 +02:11:14.2 J2000

This source is within the XRT error circle, and not present in the DSS. 
The source is about R ~ 20.3 mag.  A subsequent image reveals that the
source is stationary.

Further observations are planned.
