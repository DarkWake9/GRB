C. Fletcher (USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event IceCube-201221A
(GCN 29102), the reported position:

RA:  261.69 (+2.29  -2.50 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 41.81 (+1.29  -1.20  deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 16.7
minutes prior until 15.2 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM
observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
