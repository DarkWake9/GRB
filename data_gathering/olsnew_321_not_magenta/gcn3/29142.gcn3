J. Rastinejad, K. Paterson, C. D. Kilpatrick, W. Fong (Northwestern) report:

We observed the location of the Swift GRB 201221D (Page et al., GCN 29112) with the MMT and Magellan Infrared Spectrograph (MMIRS) mounted on the MMT 6.5-meter telescope on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. We obtained 25x60-sec imaging in J-band at a mid-time of 2020 December 22.36 UT (0.40 days post-burst). Within the vicinity of the XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 29113; Evans et al., GCN 29119), we detect a marginally extended source, consistent with the location of emission detected in previously reported optical follow up and archival imaging (Malesani et al., GCN 29117; Dichiara et al., GCN 29128; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 29132; Kilpatrick et al., GCN 29133).

After calibrating our stacked image to isolated stars detected in the 2MASS photometric catalog (Cutri et al., 2003, NASA/IPAC), we applied a 3 arcsecond aperture and measure a magnitude of J = 21.8 +/- 0.2 mag (AB and not corrected for Milky Way extinction).

Further observations are planned to assess any variability of the source. We thank Ryan Howie and Joannah Hinz at the MMT for the rapid scheduling and execution of these observations.
