Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 19:31:42.50 UT on 12 May 2014, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 140512A (trigger 421615905 / 140512814)
which was also detected by Swift (C. Pagani et al. 2014, GCN 16249).
The GBM on-ground location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the Swift/BAT location.

The GBM light curve shows a complex structure, consisting of two main
separated episodes with a total duration (T90) of about 148.0 s (50-300
keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-10.240 s to T0+152.578 s is well fit
by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -1.33 +/- 0.03 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 588 +/- 84 keV.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.30 +/- 0.10)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+128.70 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 11.0 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
