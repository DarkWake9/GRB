The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB.

At 06:45:53.34 UT on 5 Jul 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220705A (trigger 678696358 / 220705282).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 149.8, Dec = -10.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 9h 59m, -10d 43'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 11.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 46 degrees.
