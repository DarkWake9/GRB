MESSENGER GRB teams,

I.G. Mitrofanov, M.L. Litvak, A.S. Kozyrev, A.B. Sanin and V.I. Tretyakov,
on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team,

S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W.
Hajdas, and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, and

J. Goldsten, on behalf of the MESSENGER NS GRB team,

Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS), RHESSI, and MESSENGER (NS)
observed this burst at 46164 s.  (MESSENGER data downlinks were delayed
because the spacecraft is in conjunction.)  As observed by Konus, it had a
duration ~ 180 s, a 20-2000 keV fluence ~ 10^-4 erg/cm2, and an
Epeak ~ 300 keV.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3
sigma error box whose area is ~ 70 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:


RA(2000) DEC(2000)
95.527   -63.850 DEGREES (CENTER)
95.422   -63.928 DEGREES (CORNER)
95.811   -63.842 DEGREES (CORNER)
95.242   -63.858 DEGREES (CORNER)
95.631   -63.772 DEGREES (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.  Spectral information will follow in
a separate circular.
