The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:52:43 UT on 3 Aug 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200803B (trigger 618166368.636552 / 200803703).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 198.5, Dec = -42.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 13m, -42d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 139.0 degrees.
