A. C. Gilmore and P. M. Kilmartin (Mt John Observatory of the University of 
Canterbury) report:

We stacked 20 x 120 second clear exposures of the GRB 070508 taken with a SBIG 
ST9e CCD on a 0.6 m f/6.4 reflector at Mt John Observatory. The exposure set was 
centred on May 8 07:49 UT (3.5 hours after the burst).  Our images do not show 
any object at the coordinates given by Berger (GCN 6386) to a limiting R 
magnitude of approximately 20.5 based on USNO B1.0 stars.

These observations were made as part of the AAVSO GRB Network, and supported by 
a grant from the Curry Foundation.
