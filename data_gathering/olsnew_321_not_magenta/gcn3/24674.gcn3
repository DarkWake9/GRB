The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2019-05-29 01:55:22 IceCube issued an alert 
(https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/41485283_132628.amon) reporting 
the detection of a track-like event with a high chance of being of 
astrophysical origin. Upon further examination, the event was found not 
to be track-like. Instead, the event is consistent with being a 
High-Energy Starting Event (HESE), but with a shower-like topology. We 
do not advise follow up of this event.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime 
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
