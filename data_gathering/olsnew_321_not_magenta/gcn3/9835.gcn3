At 16:11:12 on 2009-08-23, GRB 090823 triggered the
Suzaku WAM.  The IPN was notified, and the burst was
also observed by KONUS-Wind, Agile-MCAL, and (during a
slew maneuver) Swift-BAT. A source was found in ground
analysis of BAT event data, which is routinely collected
during many pre-planned slews, and the source location
was confirmed by IPN triangulation.

The BAT position is RA, Dec 228.711, 60.660 which is
equivalent to

      RA, Dec (J2000): 15:14:50.6,  60d 39' 36"

with an uncertainty radius of 4 arcmin (estimated 90%
containment, stat+sys).

We have triangulated GRB 090823 to a Konus-WAM annulus
centered at RA(2000)=141.472 (09h 25m 53s)
Dec(2000)=+9.275 (+9d 16' 31"), whose radius is
52.640 ± 4.346 deg (3 sigma). The BAT source is
0.384 deg (0.27 sigma) from the center line of the
annulus.

As observed in Suzaku-WAM and Agile-MCAL, the burst had
two peaks at about T+1 and T+4 seconds, and had emission
above 700 keV but not above 1.4 MeV. The BAT lightcurve
shows that the emission began with a slow rise beginning
about T-3 seconds, and decayed back to background rates
by about T+20 seconds. The BAT event data, from which
mask-weighted spectra and images are constructed, began
at about T+10.5 seconds, missing 99% of the burst.

A Swift Target of Opportunity has been requested and
approved to follow up this burst with the Swift XRT and
UVOT about 32 hours after the burst.
