   KS Baliyan, S Ganesh and  UC Joshi (MIRO-PRL, Ahmedabad, India) 
   report:
   
   We observed the field around position of the optical counterpart of 
   GRB061126 (Swift BAT trigger number 240766) beginning about 8 hours 
   after the burst. The 1296*1154 CCD mounted on the 1.2 M telescope of 
   Mt Abu IR Observatory, operated by Physical Research Laboratory, 
   Ahmedabad- India, was used to observe OT in RI bands and white light
   with 180 and 120 secs exposures. 
 

     The visual inspection of the images shows a very faint source in
   I band and white light images at the position mentioned in GCN 5856.
   The results of detailed photometry will be reported later. The 
   monitoring of the source is going on.
