A. Y. Q. Ho (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of the Zwicky Transient
Facility collaboration:

We obtained a target-of-opportunity observation of ZTF21aaeyldq/AT2021any
(Ho et al., GCN 29305) with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory starting at
UT 2021-01-17 (02h29), which is 0.81d after the first optical detection. We
detected X-ray emission at the transient position with a count rate 0.0067
ct/s. Assuming a neutral hydrogen column density n_H = 8.12E20/cm2
(Willingale et al. 2013) and a power-law spectrum with photon index 2, the
unabsorbed flux is 2.9E-13 erg/cm^2/s. At z=2.514 (A. de Ugarte Postigo et
al., GCN 29307) the luminosity is 1.5E46 erg/s, typical of GRB afterglows
at this epoch.

Further monitoring is planned, and we thank the Swift team for rapidly
scheduling and executing our observations.
