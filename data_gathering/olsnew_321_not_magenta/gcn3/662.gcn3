TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  662
SUBJECT: GRB000418, UBVRI field photometry update
DATE:    00/05/03 18:16:03 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

Final UBVRcIc all-sky photometry for the field of GRB000418
is now available on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000418.dat
It has been acquired with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on three
photometric nights.  This 11x11arcmin field surrounds
the proposed counterpart and extends a little fainter than V=21.
All stars brighter than V=14 are saturated and should be used
with care.  The astrometry in this file
is based on linear plate solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.
The internal errors are less than 100mas.

The field is filled with galaxies.  In fact, object C
in the original list of comparison stars is a galaxy; it
has been replaced in the updated table below with a stellar
object (G) to the north of the optical counterpart:

Notes: star A is the Mirabal et. al. comparison star;
x,y offsets are in arcsec with respect to this star,
positive east and north.
