E. Semkov (Institute of Astronomy, Sofia, Bulgaria) report:
 
The afterglow of the HETE burst (H2652) GRB 030329 (Peterson & Price, 
GCN 1985; Torii: GCN 1986) was observed with the 50/70 cm Schmidt 
telescope of the National Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria) on 2, 3 and 3 
April, Rc filter, 5 x 300 sec coo-added exposures.
The observations were carried out under good seeing conditions. Using 
field photometry of Henden (GCN2082) we estimate the brightness of the 
optical afterglow in Rc band as follows.

2.04 (UT 21.3) R=17.66  +/-0.09
3.04 (UT 20.2) R=17.73  +/-0.11
4.04 (UT 19.5) R=18.11  +/-0.18
