M. Nysewander, D. Reichart, A. Foster, M. Schwartz, P. Holvorcem report on
the behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the localization of GRB 060206 (Morris et al., GCN 4682) with
the 32-inch Tenagra II telescope in the Arizona Sonoran Desert in the V
band beginning 26.5 hours after the burst.

We do not detect the afterglow (Fynbo et al., GCN 4683) to V > 19.2 mag (3
sigma) at an effective time of 27.3 hours after the burst (calibrated to
five NOMAD stars).
