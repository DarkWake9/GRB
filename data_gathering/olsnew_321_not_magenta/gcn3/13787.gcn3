of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The long-duration GRB 120919A
(Fermi-GBM detection: Rau, GCN 13785;
IPN detection and localization: Hurley et al., GCN 13786)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=26678.597s UT (07:24:38.597)

The light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~8 s
followed by a weaker and softer emission till ~T0+30 s.
The emission in the main bursting episode is seen up to 7 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120919_T26678/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.4(-0.1,+0.1)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+2.432s,
of 4.1(-0.5,+0.5)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -1.05 (-0.1, +0.1),
and Ep = 225(-19, +23) keV,
chi2 = 100.3/84 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
