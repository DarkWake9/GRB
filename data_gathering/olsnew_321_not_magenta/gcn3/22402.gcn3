report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:19:19.14 UT on 05 February 2018, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located a bright SGR-like burst (trigger 539554764 / 180205847).

The source was also detected by the Swift/BAT and Swift/XRT (Barthelmy et al. 2018, GCN 22389)
and identified as AXP CXOU J164710.2-455216/PSR J1647-4552.
The GBM location is consistent with the Swift/XRT position.

The GBM light curve shows a bright peak with a duration of about 0.1 s.
The time-averaged spectrum over from T0-0.064 to T0+0.064 is best fit by
a power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.79 +/- 0.32 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 38 +/- 3 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.38 +/- 0.6)E-07 erg/cm^2. The photon flux measured starting
from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 18 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

At the time of writing, the source has triggered two more times in GBM.
Based on the former source activity (GCN 22027) more triggers are likely
expected in the next days which, however, will not be reported in future circulars."
