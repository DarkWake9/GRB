TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  582
SUBJECT: GRB 000301C, Optical Observation

J. P. Halpern, N. Mirabal, & S. Lawrence (Columbia U.) report
on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We reobserved GRB 000301C in the R band on March 4.50 UT using 
the MDM 1.3m telescope, measuring R = 20.61 +/- 0.04, referenced
to the comparison stars of Garnavich et al. (GCN #573). 
The power-law decay derived from this and previous measurements
(GCNs #575,576,578,579) is slower than previously indicated.
We find alpha = -1.07 +/- 0.09.  This predicts R = 20.95 on
March 5.50 UT.

The decay curve and a new CCD image are posted at
