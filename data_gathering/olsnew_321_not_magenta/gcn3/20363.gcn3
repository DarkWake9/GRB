Yi Zhao (IHEP), Hancheng Li (IHEP) and Minzi Feng (IHEP)
report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-01-02T02:51:18.00 UT (T0), during a routine on-ground 
search of data, POLAR detected the GRB 170102A, 
which was also detected by the KONUS-Wind.

The POLAR light curve consists of multiple peaks,
with a duration (T90) of 40.03 s measured from T0-1.66 s.
The 1-s peak rate measured from T0+23.00 s is 335.7 cnts/s.
The total counts is about 4727 cnts. The above measurements
are in the energy range of about 80-500 keV.
