S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC)  on behalf of the Swift team report:

Swift trigger 551030 was due to a noise fluctuation in the image domain
near (10 arcmin) the catalog source NGC1097.  This 10 arcmin distance,
a low image significance (5.82 sigma), and the lack of an XRT source
strongly indicate that this trigger is non-astrophysical.
