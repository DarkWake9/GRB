S. B. Cenko (GSFC), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), V. D'Elia (ASDC),
J. A. Kennea (PSU) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

Due to a known race condition in the BAT onboard software,
Swift incorrectly misidentified a currently-active source
as an newly-active source above threshold. 

This is not an interesting astrophysical event.
