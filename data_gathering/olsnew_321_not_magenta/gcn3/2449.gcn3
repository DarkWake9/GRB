Odyssey GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, S. Charyshnikov, V. Grinkov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, and
A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey-HEND, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 76071
seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 12
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately 2.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  3.6E-07 erg/cm2 s over 1.00 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 5400 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  18 h  3 m  7.25 s     +6 o 11 '  57.74 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 18 h  3 m 24.78 s     +6 o 36 '   3.55 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 18 h 12 m 30.40 s    +13 o 35 '  50.66 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 17 h 55 m 46.82 s     -0 o  7 '  20.57 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 18 h  2 m 50.10 s     +5 o 48 '   4.42 " 

This error box may be improved.
