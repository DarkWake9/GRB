K. Hurley, R. M. Kippen, S. Barthelmy, and T. Cline, on behalf
of the Ulysses, BATSE, and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, BATSE, and NEAR observed GRB000323 (BATSE #8049).  As
observed by Ulysses, this burst had a T90 duration of about 90
s and a 25-100 keV fluence of about 4.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.  We
have triangulated this burst to a preliminary ~750 sq. arcmin. error box
whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 12 h 51 m 59.81 s     48 o 49 '   6.46 "  (CENTER)
 12 h 52 m 48.03 s     48 o 26 '  56.20 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 50 m 24.05 s     48 o 46 '  14.07 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 53 m 35.73 s     48 o 51 '  54.67 "  (CORNER)
 12 h 51 m 10.65 s     49 o 11 '  19.28 "  (CORNER)

Only minor refinements to this error box are expected.
