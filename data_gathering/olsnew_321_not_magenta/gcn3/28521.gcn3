The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:14:39 UT on 28 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200928B (trigger 622991684.150156 / 200928552).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 74.5, Dec = -11.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 58m, -11d 35'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
