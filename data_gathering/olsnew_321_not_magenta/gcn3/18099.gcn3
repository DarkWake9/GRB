SUBJECT: GRB150724B: Retraction of the uvot detection

Paul Kuin (MSSL/UCL) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT
team:

In GCN Circ.18075 we reported a detection in the first two
white band images with the Swift UVOT.

Further examination of the UVOT data showed that in the
initial analysis the background region included part off
the detector and gave a false reading. Correcting for that
it is found that for the first two images there is just an
upper limit of  white > 22.00 mag at 88.7ks after the
trigger.

We apologise for the confusion this error may have caused.
