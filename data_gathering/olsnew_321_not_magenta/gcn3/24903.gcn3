Martin Jelinek and Jan Strobl (ASU CAS Ondrejov, CZ)
report:

We observed GRB 190627A (Sonbas et al. GCNC 24888) with the 50 cm robotic
telescope (D50) of Ondrejov observatory in the Czech Republic, obtaining a
series of 120s images starting at 20:35UT, i.e. 33.3h post trigger.

We can detect the optical afterglow (Siegel & Sonbas, GCNC 24889; Leonini
et al., GCNC 24893 and others), providing the preliminary magnitude R=19.8,
in a good agreement with extrapolation of the power-law decay slope we
observed the last night.
