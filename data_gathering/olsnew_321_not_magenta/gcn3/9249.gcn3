"Poonam Chandra (RMC), Dale A. Frail (NRAO) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward the
high redshift GRB 090423 (GCN 9198) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009
Apr. 25.00 UT. We do not detect any radio emission either within the
Swift-XRT error circle (GCN 9205) or at the UKIRT K-band position (GCN
9202). The 3-sigma upper limit on the radio flux density of GRB
afterglow is 135 uJy (map rms 45 uJy).

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
