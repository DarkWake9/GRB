C.Rinner ; F.Kugel report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080430 detected by SWIFT
with the TEL 0.5-m f/3 reflector
located at Observatoire Chante-Perdix - 04 Banon, France (A77 mpc station)

The observations started at 21:33:18 (UT).
24 exposures of 120s were carried out and weather conditions
were good.

We observe a new source in the error box given by SWIFT
at the following position:

RA(J2000.0) = 11h 01m 14.76s
DEC(J2000.0) +51d 41' 08.3"
+/-0.3"

magnitude = 18.6 +/-0.3

Astrometry and magnitudes were measured with the  USNO-SA2.0 catalogue.

No change magnitude was observed during the one hour observation.
