The long GRB 071003 (Swift-BAT trigger #292934:
Schady et al., GCN 6837; Ukwatta et al., GCN 6842) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=27655.120 s UT (07:40:55.120).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure
with a duration of ~30 s. There is a hint of
the weak extended emission reported by BAT
(Ukwatta et al., GCN 6842) in the Konus-Wind data.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 5.32(-0.67, +0.30)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+2.464 s
of 1.22(-0.22, +0.19)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+30.720 s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.97 +/- 0.07
and Ep = 799(-100, +124) keV (chi2 = 74.2/74 dof).
The spectrum of the most intense part
(from T0 to T0+14.336 s) is well fitted
(in the same range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model
with alpha = 0.76 (-0.07, +0.06)
and Ep = 780(-70, +81) keV (chi2 = 75.6/74 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
