WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory, responded to Swift GRB 210222B (Gropp et al.,

GCN 29545) starting at ~0.44 days after the burst. A total of

30x60s images were obtained in the clear (roughly R) filters.

We do not detect the optical afterglow (Gropp et al., GCN 29545;

Hu et al., GCNC 29546; Strausbaugh et al., GCNC 29547; Mong et al.,

GCNC 29548; Perley, GCNC 29549; Agui Fernandez et al., GCNC 29552;

Lipunov et al., GCNC 29554; Jelinek et al., GCN 29557) in the

co-add images, down to a limiting magnitude of ~20.0 mag calibrated

to the USNOB1.0 catalog.
