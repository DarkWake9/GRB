R. Marcinkowski (PSI), H.L. Xiao (PSI) and W. Hajdas (PSI) report on behalf of the POLAR collaboration:

At 2017-02-20 18:48:01.00 UT(T0), during a routine on-ground search of data, 
POLAR detected short GRB 170220A, which was also observed by Konus at 18:47:58.467 UT.
 

The POLAR light curve consists of 1 peak with duration (T90) of 0.3 +/- 0.1 s measured from T0. 
The 50 ms peak flux at T0 + 0.7 s is equal to 7300 +/- 100 counts/sec. 
POLAR recorded 1230 events from the burst. 
Above measurements are in the energy range of about 50 - 500 keV.

The analysis results presented above are preliminary.   POLAR is a dedicated 
Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter which was launched on-board the Chinese space
 laboratory Tiangong-2 (TG-2) on Sep 15, 2016. The energy detection range
 of POLAR is ~ 50-500 keV.
