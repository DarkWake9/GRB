The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for short 
GRB 170428A (Beardmore et al., GCN 21042) as part of the 4pisky program, 
and subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 3 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Apr 28.42 and Apr 30.34 
(UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location (Beardmore et 
al., GCN 21047), with 3sigma upper limits of 117 uJy and 96 uJy 
respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
