Additonal observations of the field of XRF 030824 (HETE 2821) have been
obtained with MEGAPRIME at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

Two 800 sec exposures with i' filter, starting on Oct 3, 08:07 UT, and

Two 300 sec exposures with r' filter, starting on Oct 4, 06:57 UT

These data are being analyzed, in comparison with the data acquired
with MEGAPRIME on Sept 21st (i' filter, Klotz et al., GCN 2406) and with
the images of the Large Format Camera recorded on August 25 and 26th
(R filter, Fox et al., GCN 2364 & 2369)

A first result of these observations is to discard the two 
sources mentioned in GCN 2406 as being possibly associated
with XRF 030824. 
These objects where selected as being significantly
brighter in the September images than in the August images 
(as expected for a SN associated with XRF 030824).
The new observations show that they are in fact very red objects, 
very faint in R but clearly visible in all i' images, and not variable. 

The whole set of observations is being re-analyzed to search for
or to constrain a possible supernova associated with XRF 030824.
