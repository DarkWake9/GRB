report on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift is conducting further observations of the 'rank 3' X-ray sources
detected in our initial search of the LIGO/VIRGO error region. These are 
uncatalogued X-ray sources which are below existing catalogue limits and 
therefore cannot be distinguished as new or pre-existing sources.

Source 23 (Evans et al, LVC Circ. 20812) appears to be fading. This 
source has now been observed three times, and a power-law fit to the 
light curves gives a slope of alpha=0.87 +/- 0.26 (1-sigma errors), i.e. 
the fading is confirmed with 3.5-sigma significance. Follow-up
observations of this source at other wavelengths are strongly 
encouraged. The UVOT-enhanced position of this source is:

RA (J2000.0):  21h 33m 14.96s = 323.31234 degrees
Dec (J2000.0): +39d 41' 09.2" = 39.68590 degrees

with an uncertainty of 4.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

Swift-UVOT observed this field in the u and uvw1 filters. No new source 
is detected to 3-sigma upper limits of 19.3 mag (u) and 19.9 mag (uvw1), 
but the position is just 10.7 arcsec from the B=12.3 mag source 
USNO-B1.0 1296-047182, so these upper limits are approximate.

X-ray Sources 1,8,14 and 18 have also been re-observed and are found to 
be ~constant and are therefore unlikely to be related to the GW event. 
Source 19 has been re-observed, but at present we cannot ascertain 
whether or not it is fading.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
