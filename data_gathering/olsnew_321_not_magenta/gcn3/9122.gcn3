the Swift Team:

At 16:57:52 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090410 (trigger=348929).  Swift could not slew to the GRB
due to a Sun constraint. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 334.980, +15.471 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 19m 55s
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 28' 16"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex peak
from T-10 to T+40, followed by another broad peak from T+80 to T+140. 
The peak count rate was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 
sec after the trigger. 

Swift cannot slew to the BAT position.  The burst is  sun-constrained
until Tuesday, 2009 April 14.  There will thus be no XRT or UVOT 
data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is D. Grupe (grupe AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
