M.C. Stroh, C. Pagani and L. Vetere (PSU) report on behalf of the  
Swift-XRT team

The Swift-XRT began observations of the SuperAGILE burst GRB 080625  
(Pacciani et al., GCN Circ 7903) ~5 hours after the trigger. The data  
consist of 3.9 ks observed in Photon Counting mode.

We detect an X-ray counterpart at position: RA, Dec = 298.40420,  
56.27747 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  19 53 37.0
Dec (J2000): +56 16 38.9

with an uncertainty of 4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This is  
consistent with the UVOT position (Immler, GCN 7905).

We are unable to determine whether the source is decaying at this  
time. Observations are continuing and further analysis regarding the  
fading nature of this source will be issued as the data become  
available.

The spectrum can be fitted with a powerlaw with an intrinsic absorbing  
column of (2.5+/-0.9) e21 cm-2 and photon index 2.31+/- 0.17. The  
observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux is 2.91 (3.00) e-12 erg cm-2 s-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
