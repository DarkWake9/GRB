At 16:33:21 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB051008 (trigger=158855).
The spacecraft did not slew immediately because of the Earth observing
constraint.  The burst will be observed by the NFIs at T+48 minutes
when it comes out of constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA,Dec 202.870d,+42.090d {13h 31m 29s,+42d 05' 26"} (J2000),
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows two main overlapping peaks with a total duration
of ~30 sec.  The peak count rate was ~7000 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~4 seconds after the trigger.  This burst happened during a Malindi
telemetry down link session, so the TDRSS burst-related notices were delayed
in transmission until the end of the downlink pass (~10 min).
