G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) and S. Xiong (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM
Team:

At 05:09:00.20 UT on 14 October 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 131014A (trigger 403420143/131014215).
High peak flux from the GRB caused GBM to issue a repoint request
that reoriented the satellite to place the GRB near the LAT boresight
for 2.5 hours, subject to Earth limb contraints.

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 101.9 , DEC = -20.0  (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 06h 47m, -20d 0.0'), with an uncertainty
of 1.00  degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.9  degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 3.2 s (50-300 keV).
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
1.9E-4 +/- 2E-7 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 311.5 +/- 1.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.0 s to T0+4.2 s is
adequately fit by a Band function with Epeak = 318 +/- 3 keV,
alpha = -0.34 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.58 +/- 0.02

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
