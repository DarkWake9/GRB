De Pasquale, M. (Istanbul Univ.) Sonbas, E. (Adiyaman Univ.), Ozdonmez, A., Er, H. (Ataturk Univ.), Ivantsov, A., (Akdeniz Univ.), Eryilmaz, S. (TUG) on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 200829A (Siegel et al., GCN #28307) with the
1.0 meter T100 telescope (TUBITAK National Observatory, Antalya - Turkey),
starting on 2020-09-01, at 20:36:18 UT (~78 hours after the trigger). We obtained 12 x 300 s exposures with R filter under good weather conditions. The Moon was present in the sky during observations.

We do not detect an optical afterglow within the reported XRT error circle down to a 3 sigma limiting magnitude of 21 in the combined R band image.


We are grateful to the TUBITAK National Observatory staff for promptly scheduling the observations and their technical support.
