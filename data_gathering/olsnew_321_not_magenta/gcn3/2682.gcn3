TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2682
SUBJECT: GRB 040827: K imaging - no evidence of variability
DATE:    04/08/28 12:40:53 GMT
FROM:    Nial Tanvir at IofA U.Cambridge  <nrt@ast.cam.ac.uk>

N. Tanvir, R. Priddey and M. Hughes (U. Hertfordshire), A. Levan
(U. Leicester), M. Swinbank (U. Durham) and J. Buckle (JAC)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the XMM error box reported by Rodriguez-Pascual and Juarez
(GCN circular 2678) with the UFTI instrument on UKIRT.  Total
exposure time was 40 minutes in the K[98] filter, begining at
August 28.22 UT.

We identify the same two K band sources reported by Gladders and
Berger (GCN Circular 2681) but our provisional photometry shows
no indication yet of variability of either source in comparison to
their reported magnitudes.  Specifically we find K=19.72 for XMM-1
and K=19.36 for XMM-2, with an error of about 0.1 mag.

We concur that XMM-2 appears extended.
