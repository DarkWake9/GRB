K. Hurley, T. Cline, E. Mazets, and M. Feroci, on behalf of the
Ulysses, Konus, NEAR, and SAX GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus, NEAR, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed a ~131 s (T90)
long burst at 46266 s UT on February 26 2000.  The 25-100 keV
fluence was ~2 x 10^-5 erg/cm^2 and the peak flux over 0.25 s
was ~10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  The error box center and corners are at:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  21 h 28 m 57.79 s    -19 o 45 '  41.88 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 21 h 29 m 16.04 s    -19 o 47 '  27.95 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 21 h 28 m 45.74 s    -19 o 46 '  49.92 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 21 h 29 m  9.84 s    -19 o 44 '  33.72 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 21 h 28 m 39.52 s    -19 o 43 '  55.48 " 

The error box area is ~20 sq. arcmin.  These values are for
3 sigma confidence, and are preliminary.  Considerable refinement
of the error box is possible.
