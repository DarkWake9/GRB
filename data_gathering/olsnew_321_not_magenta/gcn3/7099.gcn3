FROM:    Daniel E. Vanden Berk at PSU/Swift  <danvb@astro.psu.edu>

D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) and T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on
behalf of the Swift UVOT Team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 2852 seconds after the BAT trigger. No
afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The
2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The typical
3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag.  The 8'x8' region for
the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error
circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the extinction of E(B-V) = 0.024.
