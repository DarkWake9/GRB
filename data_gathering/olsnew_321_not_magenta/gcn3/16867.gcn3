D. A. Perley and J. Jencson (Caltech) report:

We imaged the location of short-duration GRB 140930B (De Pasquale et 
al., GCN 16857) using the Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infrared 
Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I 10 meter telescope between 08:44 and 
09:04 on 2014-10-01 (UT).   We acquired 9 x 35-second exposures in 
Ks-band and 9 x 44-second exposures in J-band.   A faint point-like 
source is detected at RA=00:25:23.433, dec=+24:17:39.41 (J2000), a 
location consistent with the afterglow locations previously reported by 
Evans et al. (GCN 16865) and Tanvir et al. (GCN 16861).  Photometry 
relative to 2MASS gives approximate magnitudes (Vega) of:

  J = 22.2 +/- 0.2    (tmid = 13.31 hr)
  Ks = 20.8 +/- 0.3   (tmid = 13.12 hr)

We thank M. Kasliwal and T. Prince for the observing time.
