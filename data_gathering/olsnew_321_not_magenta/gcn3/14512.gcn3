S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC), J. R. Cummings (GSFC/UMBC),
P.A. Evans, and K.L. Page (U. Leicester)  (on behalf of the Swift team):
 
Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT trigger #554135 (Baumgartner, et al.,
GCN Circ. 14433).   This trigger is due to noise in the BAT image domain.
There is no XRT source in the BAT error circle.  It is not astrophysical.
