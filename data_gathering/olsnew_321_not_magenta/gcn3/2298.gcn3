Robert Quimby, Erin McMahon, and Jeremy Murphy (U. Texas) write:

We have compiled all the optical, radio, and X-ray data reported in the
GCN Circulars over the last year (~875 GCNs). The messages have been
marked up in HTML, and can be viewed at
http://grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php.

A search form provided at http://grad40.as.utexas.edu/search.php can be
used to select messages, bursts, or data which meet very specific criteria
such as to find all GRBs with a 25-100 keV fluence greater than 1e-6
erg/cm^2, and duration longer than 5 seconds that were observed in the R
band within 12 hours of the burst trigger, but had no detected afterglow
to a limiting magnitude of 19.

As an example, plots of each data set for the GRB 030329 afterglow, along
with links to the data tables can be found at:

grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php?view=data&GRB=030329&datatype=optical
grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php?view=data&GRB=030329&datatype=radio
grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php?view=data&GRB=030329&datatype=xray

The magnitudes of the optical data come directly from their respective GCN
Circs. They have not been placed on the same photometric system; however,
each reference system is listed in the table.

We are currently archiving the remaining GCNs. We hope to have all GCNs
entered by early Fall.
