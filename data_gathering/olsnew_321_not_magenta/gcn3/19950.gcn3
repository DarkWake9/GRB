The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160912A (Cannizzo et al., GCN 19912) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Sep 12.72, Sep 13.81, and 
Sep 18.87 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT location 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 19915), with 3sigma upper limits of 147 uJy, 258 
uJy, and 102 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
