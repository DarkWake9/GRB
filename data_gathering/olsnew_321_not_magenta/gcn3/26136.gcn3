The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 21:28:50 UT on 1 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191101B (trigger 594336535.522754 / 191101895).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 153.7, Dec = 19.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 10h 14m, 19d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 118.0 degrees.
