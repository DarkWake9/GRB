report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:07:18.23 UT on 13 June 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190613A (trigger 582091643/ 190613172),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Ambrosi et al. 2019, GCN 24798).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight
at the GBM trigger time is 9 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 18 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.0 s to T0+19.4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is 0.06 +/- 0.18 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 108 +/- 5 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.092 +/- 0.129)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T+11.9 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
