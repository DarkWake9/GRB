 "We have imaged the entire GRB 040825A error box 
 provided by HETE-2 (trigger # 11553) with the 0.6-m  
 telescope (+MOA camera) at Mt.John Observatory as 
 follows:
  

  Date of Aug.    Exp.Time   Error box     Lim. Mag.
   2004 UT          (s)      coverage (%)  (3 sigma)
 ---------------------------------------------------
  25.4028-25.4346  4x300     ~75(North)     R~21.1
  25.5292-25.5426  2x300     ~25(South)     R~20.7
 ---------------------------------------------------

 Observations were performed with the MOA broad R-band 
 filter (similar to Ic). Apart from several slow moving 
 sources, visual comparison of the stacked image with 
 the DSS-2 plates revealed no variable source."
