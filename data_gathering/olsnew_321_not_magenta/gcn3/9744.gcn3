A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM 
Team:

"At 15:58:23.44 UT on 2 August 2009, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 090208B (trigger 270921505 / 090802666).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 267.0, DEC = -71.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 17h48m, -71d46'),
with an uncertainty of 10.7 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which
is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 104 degrees.
Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained."
