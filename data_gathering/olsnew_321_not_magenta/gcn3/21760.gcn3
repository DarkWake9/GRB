T. J. Pearson and A. C. S. Readhead (Caltech) on behalf of the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory.

The KuPol receiver on the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40m telescope is a
dual-beam switched radiometer with a resolution ~ 3 arcmin operating in the
13-18 GHz band (http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ovroblazars/).

We observed the candidate counterpart SSS17a and NGC 4993 at the following
times (UTC):

2017-08-19T21:57:46 to 2017-08-20T01:38:52
2017-08-23T21:18:44 to 2017-08-24T00:10:30

On-off measurements of about 32s on-source integration were inerleaved with
calibration observations, for a cadence of roughly 15 measurements per hour.

In both periods there was no signal above our 3-sigma detection limit ~ 50
mJy in any individual on-off measurement.

Further observations are planned, along with improved analysis to refine
the upper limit.
