NUMBER:  804
SUBJECT: GRB 000926: Optical candidate

T. Dall (NOT and University of Aarhus), J.P.U. Fynbo (ESO),
H. Pedersen, B.L. Jensen, J. Hjorth (U. of Copenhagen) and
J. Gorosabel (DSRI, Copenhagen)
report on behalf of a larger European GRB Collaboration:

"Using the ALFOSC on the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope, we have
obtained U,B,R and I-band imaging of the field of GRB 000926
(Hurley et al., GCN #801) on 2000 September 27.8-28.1 UT.
Comparing with DSS-2 (red) we find a bright point source
not visible on the DSS-2 exposure.

The coordinates of this object are:

RA(J2000)  :  17 04 09.62
Dec(J2000) : +51 47 11.2
(with an uncertainty of about 2")

These coordinates are consistent with those reported 
independently by Gorosabel et al.

This object is detected in both U,B,R and I-band images.
A 1hr spectrum covering the region 3500AA-7000AA has been obtained
showing a blue spectrum with strong absorption lines. The redshift 
has not yet been determined.

A preliminary magnitude for the object is: R=19.3 +- 0.2.

Ingvar Svaerdh and Charlotte Moeller are acknowledged for help
with the observations."
