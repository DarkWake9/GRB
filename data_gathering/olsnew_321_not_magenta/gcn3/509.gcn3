K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, M. Feroci, on behalf
of the BeppoSAX GRB team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the NEAR GRB
team, report:

Ulysses, the BeppoSAX GRBM, and NEAR observed a ~25 s long burst
whose 25-100 keV fluence was ~2 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 on December 26, 
1999 at 14:59:57 UT.  We have triangulated this burst to two
possible ~70 sq. arcmin. error boxes, whose coordinates are given
below.  Further examination of the BeppoSAX data should allow us
to determine which of the intersections the burst originates
from.
