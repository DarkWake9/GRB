There are 6 MASTER Very Wide Field cameras located at Kislovodsk and Irkutsk 
with common FOW = 6000 square degrees (http://observ.pereplet.ru/).

One of the four  MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Kislovodsk
(D=50 mm, 4x1000 square degrees, 11 Mpx) has observed  ~80% 1-sigma Fermi 
error box  (Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge, GCN 8972) with 1s exposure
during  all night: 7 hours befoure, during and 1 hours after GRB Time 
without time gap between images.


Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitude limit of the each emage is  ~9.5 m at the edge of FOW.

We do not detect OT inside part of the error box  (Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge, GCN 
8972)  brighter than 9.2 mag before and after trigger time.
We  conclude in case that GRB inside our FOW that:

1). the optical fluence during the short 2 s GRBurst is limited by

                       ~<= 1 x 10E-8 erg/cm_2

excluding possible  host galaxy absorbtion.

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.7 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2 (Colleen A. Wilson-Hodge, GCN
8972).

So:

2).  Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8-1000 keV) ~ < 1/100

The same ratio for long GRB080319B is

Optical-Fluence/Gamma-Fluence(8 - 1000 keV) ~ 1/140

(Naked Eye GRB, Racusin, Karpov et al., Nature, vol.455, 183, 2008).


The film of our observations (from 10 s before and 15 s after GRB time) is 
available at

White & black circles are the 1-sigma & 3-sigma+systematic (2 degrees) 
error boxes correspondingly. Black rectangle is the IPN error box (Palshin et al., private 
communication).

The FOWs of the 2 cameras are available at

The reduction is continued.
