K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports:

 The error region of the possible GRB 061109 (Falcone et al. GCN 5790)
was observed with the 0.3m telescope in the New Mexico Skies
Observatory.  Starting at 261 s after the trigger time, five frames of
120s exposure were acquired through Ic filter. The first frame was
partly saturated and turned out to be useless.

 We do not identify a new object within the BAT error circle and
derive the following upper limits relative to USNO-B1.0 I magnitude.

------------------------------------------
StartUT	Filter	Mag	Nframes
------------------------------------------
00:43:30 Ic	>15.0	1
00:46:25 Ic	>15.5	1
