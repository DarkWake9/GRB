D. T. Durig (Cordell-Lorenz Observatory, University of the South), A. Oksanen
(Nyrola Observatory), C. Pullen (AAVSO) and A. Price (AAVSO) report on behalf of
the AAVSO International High Energy Network on optical observations of GRB050525
(GCN #3466; Band et al.):

 An afterglow candidate is found at the location reported by Rykoff et al. (GCN
#3468) and Band et al. (GCN #3465). At 08:13 UT it is detected at an unfiltered
magnitude of 18-19 (fading over 100 mins centered on 08:13UT). The USNO star near
18 32 34.5 +26 20 24 can not completely be resolved from the afterglow candidate.

 Report: The USNO star near 18 32 34.5 +26 20 24 can not completely be resolved 
from the afterglow candidate, but I do see it fade by around 1 mag over a little 
over 100 min by summing a series of 30 consecutive 120 sec exposures. I get a 
measured position of 18 32 33.9 +26 20 23 and 18 mag at 7:23 UT falling to 19 mag 
at 9:03 UT, but this includes some contribution from the USNO star.
