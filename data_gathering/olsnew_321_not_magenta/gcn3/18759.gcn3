  The La Silla-QUEST survey operating the 10-sq-deg QUEST camera on the 
1.0m ESO Schmidt at La Silla, Chile has covered th e ~90% confidence 
area for LVC event G21117 between Dec +27 and -13 deg. Analysis is 
ongoing, and further survey observa tions are planned. One target 
(LSQ15bvw) has been detected with high confidence outside the 90% 
confidence region:

LSQ15bvw appears as an isolated source not visible in years 2012 and 
2013.  Observations made 2015 Oct 28 and 29 (V mag 19.2 on JD 
2457384.6032 and V mag 18.8 on 2457385.6006) indicate that the object is 
brightening by ~ 0.5 mags per day.


Several other sources have been detected with lower confidence. All 
appear as likely supernova near the center of distant (z>0.01) host 
galaxies :
