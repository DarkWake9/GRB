Using INTEGRAL we have performed a search for a prompt gamma-ray
counterpart of the cosmic neutrino candidate IceCube-190124A
(GCN 23785).

At the time of the event (2019-01-24 03:43:54 UT, hereafter T0),
INTEGRAL was operating in nominal mode except for the SPI detector
which was undergoing annealing procedure. The peak of the neutrino
localization probability (GCN 23785) was at an angle of 90 deg with
respect to the spacecraft pointing axis, but from a direction such
that the IBIS instrument assembly is blocking the SPI-ACS detector.
This particularly unfavorable orientation implies considerably
suppressed responses of ISGRI, IBIS/Veto, and SPI-ACS.


The background within +/-300 seconds around the event was very
stable.Â  We do not detect any significant counterparts and estimate
a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 5.1e-07 erg/cm^2
for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB
spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with alpha=-0.5 and
Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s
around T0.

For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1,
beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived peak flux upper limit is
~7.2e-07 (2.1e-06) erg/cm^2/s at 1 s (8 s) time scale in 75-2000
keV energy range.
