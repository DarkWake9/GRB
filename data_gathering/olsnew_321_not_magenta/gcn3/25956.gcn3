We observed the optical afterglow (Lipunov et al., GCN 25948, Strausbaugh et al., GCN 25949) of the Swift/BAT GRB 191004B (Cenko et al., GCN 25947) using the ESO VLT UT2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Our spectra cover the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA, and consist of 6 exposures by 600 s each. The observation mid time was 2019 Oct 05 at about 5:30 UT (8 hr after the GRB).
In a 30 s image taken with the acquisition camera on Oct 05.1989 UT, we detect the optical afterglow, for which we measure a magnitude r = 21.23 +- 0.03 AB (calibrated against nearby stars from the SkyMapper catalog; Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, 35, 010; https:doi.org/10.4225/41/593620ad5b574).

We clearly detect continuum over the full covered wavelength range. A strong absorption is visible around 5474 AA, and an emission feature at 5479 AA, which we identify as due to H I. This is confirmed by the presence of the Ly alpha forest blueward of this wavelength. We also detect other narrower absorption features which we interpret as due to e.g. C IV and Si IV at a common redshift z = 3.503. The continuum is well detected down to ~800 AA rest frame, i.e, below the Lyman limit.
We also detect an intervening absorber (Mg II, Fe II) at z=2.137
We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in Paranal, in particular Camila Navarrete and Bin Yang.
