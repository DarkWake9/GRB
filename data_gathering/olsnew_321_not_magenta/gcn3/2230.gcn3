Ulysses, RHESSI, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE-FREGATE
(H2714) observed this GRB at 05024 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it
had a duration of approximately 25 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  1.5E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
1.3E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 331.814, -35.254 degrees, whose radius is 47.844 +/-  0.025
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved. but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
