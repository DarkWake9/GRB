T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:55:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 071008 (trigger=293587). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 151.548, +44.334 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 06m 11s
   Dec(J2000) = +44d 20' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 15 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Because Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, 
automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled outside of
business hours (US EDT).  Therefore, there 
are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Moretti (moretti AT merate.mi.astro.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
