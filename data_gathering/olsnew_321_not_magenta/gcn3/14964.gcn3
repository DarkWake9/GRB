TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14964
SUBJECT: GRB 130623A: Second Swift-XRT  observation 
DATE:    13/07/02 13:46:06 GMT
FROM:    Dirk Grupe at PSU/Swift-XRT  <dxg35@psu.edu>

Dirk Grupe (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift reobserved the field of the ground-detected GRB 130623A 
(Cummings, GCN circ. 14921) again on 2013-June-30 for 10.25 ks. 
The source reported initially in Grupe et al. (circular 14926) 
seems to have faded. We do not detect the source anymore and 
can only measure a 3 sigma upper limit at a level of 
1.9e-3 counts/s in the XRT. 
This measurement suggests that the source reported in
Grupe et al. (circular 14926) may be the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 130623A.


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020284.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
