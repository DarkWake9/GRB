The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:48:30 UT on 14 Sep 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200914A (trigger 621780515.03441 / 200914534).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 256.4, Dec = -37.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 05m, -37d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62.0 degrees.
