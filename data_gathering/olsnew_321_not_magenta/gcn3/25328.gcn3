D. A. Perley, C. M. Copperwheat (LJMU), D. B. Malesani (DTU Space), and
A. Levan (Radboud) report on behalf of the Global Relay of Observatories
Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) and other collaborations:

We observed the locations of 19 galaxies within the error volume of
S190814bf (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, GCN
25324), selected in coordination with other La Palma telescopes using
the HOGWARTS code (https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie/) as in GCN 25325
(Heintz et al.).   Most galaxies were observed with 2x150 second
exposures in r-band; several of the highest-probability candidates were
also observed with 2x150 seconds in i-band.  Observations took place
between 01:38 and 05:33 UT.  Visual inspection shows no apparent
candidates in any of the images in comparison to archival imaging from
Pan-STARRS.  Target locations were:
