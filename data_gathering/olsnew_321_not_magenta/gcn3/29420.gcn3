Observatory Team:

At 21:52:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210207B (trigger=1031297).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 270.582, +53.694 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 18h 02m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = +53d 41' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 100 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~45 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 21:53:22.0 UT, 73.9 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located
at RA, Dec 270.6356, 53.6836 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 18h 02m 32.54s
   Dec(J2000) = +53d 41' 01.0"
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 120 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. No event data are yet available to determine the
column density using X-ray spectroscopy. 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.09e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 82 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	18:02:32.40 = 270.63501
  DEC(J2000) = +53:40:56.0  =  53.68223
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.74 arc sec. This position is 5.1
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
13.72 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.14. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.041.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
