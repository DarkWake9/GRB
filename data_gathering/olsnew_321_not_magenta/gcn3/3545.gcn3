on behalf of Konus-Wind and Helicon/Coronas-F teams, and
T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

An SGR-like burst 050611 triggered Konus-Wind
at 58099.759 s UT (16:08:19.759).
It was detected and localized by HETE WXM (HETE trigger 3800).
The HETE error box includes the position of SGR 1806-20,
so we conclude that this burst originated from this SGR.

The burst had a duration of ~2.3 sec,
fluence (8.41 ± 0.12)10-6 erg/cm2,
and peak flux on 16-ms time scale (8.6 ± 0.9)10-6 erg/cm2 s
(both in 20-200 keV range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst can be fitted by the OTTB
spectral model:
dN/dE ~ E^{-1} exp(-E/kT),
with kT = 19 ± 1 keV.
