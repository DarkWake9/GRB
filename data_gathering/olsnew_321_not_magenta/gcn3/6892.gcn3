A. Oksanen (Nyrola Observatory, Jyvaskyla, Finland), M. Templeton (AAVSO) 
and A. Henden (AAVSO) report further details on optical observations of 
GRB071010B (GCN #6871, Markwardt et al.; GCN #6873 Oksanen; GCN #6878 
Kennea et al.; GCN #6884 Kann et al.):

Further to the initial report given in GCN #6873, Arto Oksanen reports 
unfiltered photometry of the GRB 071010B afterglow spanning 2007 Oct 10 
21:02:33 UT to 2007 Oct 11 03:24:27 UT (T0 + 17 minutes to T0 + 6 hours 39 
minutes post-burst).  The data are reasonably well fit by a single power 
law with index -1.14.  The measured unfiltered magnitudes are 
approximately 0.3 magnitudes fainter than the Rc magnitudes reported by 
Kann et al (GCN #6884) taken at the same time, which is consistent with 
differences in zero-point calibration and bandpass.  It should be noted 
that this field is covered by the SDSS, and that the AAVSO will obtain a 
BVRI calibration with the Sonoita Research Observatory, weather 
permitting.

Oksanen also reports additional preliminary Ic and V-band magnitudes:

2007 Oct 10, 21:32 UT   Ic = 17.64 +/- 0.05
2007 Oct 10, 21:52 UT   V  = 18.30 +/- 0.05

Both magnitudes are calibrated relative to the transformed SDSS ugriz
magnitudes for the object at RA 10:01:54.62, Dec +45:40:29.0 (J2000).

Further details of these observations, light curves, and analyses are in
preparation for publication in the electronic Journal of the AAVSO.
