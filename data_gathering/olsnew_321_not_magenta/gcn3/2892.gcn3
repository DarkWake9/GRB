GRB follow-up team report:

We observed the INTEGRAL GRB 041218 (Mereghetti et al. GCN #2858) using
the ISAS-Kanazawa automated 1.3m telescope at the roof top of the
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in Sagamihara city. 
The first observation started at 16:06:54 UT in a poor condition. The
stacked image of 30sx20 revealed a faint object with Rc=17.6 with an
error of 0.5 at the position reported by Torii and Gorosabel et al.
(GCNs # 2860, 2861). This was the first detection of this system with 
a capability of R, J, H, K bands. Further analysis in progress.
