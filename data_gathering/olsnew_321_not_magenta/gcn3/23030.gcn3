(PSU) and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 180718A (Svinkin et al. GCN Circ. 22959),
collecting 1.5 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+113.7 ks
and T0+115.2 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 296
arcsec of the Swift/BAT position. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field
ranges from ~0.005 to ~0.013 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV
observed flux of 2.1e-13 to 5.1e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical
GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020802.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
