Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100513A (trigger #421814)
(Baumgartner, et al., GCN Circ. 10746).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 169.606, 3.617 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  11h 18m 25.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 37' 00.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 90%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-40 sec, peaking around T_zero, and ending at ~T+60 sec with a weak
tail extending out to around T+180 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 84 +- 21 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-64.1 to T+44.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.62 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.09 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
