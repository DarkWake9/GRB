At 21:19:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a flare from Algol (trigger=331592).  Swift slewed immediately
to the location.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 47.029, +40.951, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 08m 07s
   Dec(J2000) = +40d 57' 05"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers,
the TDRSS BAT light curve does not show anything significant. 

The XRT began observing the field at 21:21:07.4 UT, 126.6 seconds after
the BAT trigger. XRT found a very bright X-ray source located at RA, Dec
47.0437, +40.9542 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 08m 10.48s
   Dec(J2000) = +40d 57' 15.1"
with an uncertainty of 6.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This position
is 6.6 arcseconds from Algol.  The prompt raw spectrum shows evidence for 
a bright Fe line.  Due to the optical brightness of Algol the XRT data suffer
from severe optical loading and care must be exercised in analyzing these 
data. 

Because Algol is a 2nd magnitude star it is too bright to be observed
with UVOT.  No data will be taken.
