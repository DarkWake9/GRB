A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

V. Connaughton, M. S. Briggs, C. Meegan, and V. Pelassa, on behalf of the Fermi
GBM team, report:

GRB 141029B (Roberts et al. GCN 16987) was also observed by INTEGRAL
(SPI-ACS) and MESSENGER, so far.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary,
3 sigma annulus, whose coordinates are RA (center), Dec (center), radius=
16.850, +5.225, 87.104 +/- 0.259 degrees.  This annulus intersects the
GBM 1 sigma (statistical-only) error circle at two points:

	RA(deg)	 Dec(deg)
      105.735    +24.226
      105.874    +25.894

to form an error box whose area is approximately 0.56 sq. deg.
This triangulation may be improved.
