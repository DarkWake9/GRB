"The 2-m Faulkes North Telescope robotically followed up Swift burst
GRB050925 3.3 min after the GRB trigger time. The automatic "detection
mode" procedure did not detect any obvious candidate brighter than about
R=19 mag from 3x10-s images (mean epoch of 3.7 min after the GRB), with
FOV of 4.6'x4.6' centred on the BAT in-flight location. The field is
crowded and the extinction in V is about 6.3 mag (Schlegel et al. maps).
Visual inspection of the images confirms the reported non-detection.
 
The limiting magnitude is automatically calculated with respect to the
USNOB1.0 'R2' values of the field objects."
