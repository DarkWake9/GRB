D. M. Palmer (LANL), P. Romano (INAF-IASFPA), M. H. Siegel (PSU) and
R. L. C. Starling (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:30:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130419A (trigger=553918).  Swift did not slew due to Sun constraint.
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 355.271, +9.977 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 23h 41m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 58' 38"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for image triggers, there is no
obvious variation in BAT's immediately-avaialble lightcurve. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 00:33 UT on 2013 May 06. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is N. P. M. Kuin (n.kuin AT ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)

sentence in the first paragraph was changed.]
