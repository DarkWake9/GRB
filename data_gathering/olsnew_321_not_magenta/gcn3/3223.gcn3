A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed the
field of GRB050410 (GCN 3219) on 2005 Apr 10.72 UT.
We do not detect a radio source coincident with the
Swift XRT position (GCN 3218).  We place a 2-sigma upper
limit of 114 uJy on the XRT error region.

Further observations are planned."
