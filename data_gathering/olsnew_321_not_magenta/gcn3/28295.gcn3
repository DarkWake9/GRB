Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations

We continued a second night of monitoring the localization region of the
short GRB200826A (Fermi trigger 620108997; GCN 28284, 28287) with the
Zwicky Transient Facility (first night summary in Sagues Carracedo et al.
GCN 28293). Each exposure was 600s, reaching a g-band median depth of 22.3
mag and r-band median depth of 22.3 mag. IPN also triangulated this GRB
(Hurley et al. GCN 28291). Our total coverage was >99% of the joint
Fermi-IPN localization.

We followed standard candidate vetting procedures. We identify the
following compelling candidate for the optical afterglow:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ZTF Name      | IAU Name  | RA (deg)  | DEC (deg)   | Filter | Mag   |
MagErr |MJD              |
+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+--------+-------+--------+-----------------+
| ZTF20abwysqy  | AT2020scz | 6.7855741 | +34.0273043 |   g    | 20.86 |
0.04   | 2459087.9181366 |
+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+--------+-------+--------+-----------------+

ZTF20abwysqy faded by >1.7 mag in 22.5 hours in the g-band. We ran forced
photometry and we obtained the following light curve:

+----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+
Time (Hrs) | Filter | Mag   | MagErr | Limmag |
+----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+
|    5.07  | g      | 20.86 | 0.048  | 22.50  |
|    5.53  | r      | 20.70 | 0.050  | 22.28  |
|    6.67  | g      | 20.96 | 0.168  | 21.24  |
|    27.5  | g      | -     | -      | 22.53  |
|    29.1  | r      | -     | -      | 21.31  |
|    30.9  | g      | -     | -      | 21.21  |
+----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+

ZTF20abwysqy is spatially coincident with X-ray Source 3 reported by the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (GCN 28290,
https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00093/) with a separation of
2" from the XRT position that has an uncertainty of 2.7". It also has a
faint underlying galaxy counterpart within 0.35" (Legacy Survey (LS) DR8
photometric redshift z = 0.714 +- 0.137 and LS DR8 r-mag = 22.55). We
strongly encourage multi-wavelength follow-up.
