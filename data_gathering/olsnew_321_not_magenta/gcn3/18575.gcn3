E. Mazaeva (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI),  I. Korobtsev 
(ISTP), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up 
collaboration:

We continue observations (GCN 18559) of the Swift GRB 151027A  (Maselli 
  et al., GCN 18478) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory 
(Mondy).   We obtained images in R-filter  on Nov., 4, 5, 7-9. In a 
combined image obtained on Nov. 7 we clearly detect a galaxy which 
coincide with the object 1513-0237216 of USNO-B1.0 catalog.  The object 
was also mentioned in GCN 18510 (Dichiara et al.) and GCN 18559 (Mazaeva 
et al.)

The finding chart can be found in

The afterglow (Maselli et al., GCN 18478; Zheng and  Filippenko, GCN 
18479) is not well detected.  The afterglow might overlap with 
North-East wing of the galaxy. The galaxy could be suggested as a host 
galaxy of GRB 151027A.

Preliminary photometry of the galaxy is R= 20.60+/-0.04 at November, 7.

The photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars referenced in GCN 18559.
