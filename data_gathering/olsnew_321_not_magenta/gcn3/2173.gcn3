K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, Konus, and Mars Odyssey GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team,

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Mars Odyssey (HEND & GRS), and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB
at 56911 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of over
500 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  5.9E-05 erg/cm2,
and a peak flux of approximately  1.6E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

Despite the intensity of the event, the burst arrival direction with
respect to the inter-spacecraft vectors was unfavorable, and we can
only triangulate it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
approximate area is 2300 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  15 h 33 m 11.26 s     26 o 17 '  30.30 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 15 h 30 m 49.56 s     25 o 23 '  00.71 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 15 h 25 m 36.77 s     23 o 33 '  25.40 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 15 h 45 m 52.03 s     30 o 47 '  37.49 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 15 h 35 m 52.69 s     27 o 18 '  54.68 " 

This error box may be improved.
