M. Nysewander, A. Fruchter and J. Graham (STScI) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the entire BAT error circle of the short GRB 070429B 
(Markwardt et al. GCN 6358) with ISPI on the Blanco 4-m at CTIO at a 
mean time of 06:10:28 UT on April 30, 2007 (1.13 days post burst) in 18 
x 60-s J-band exposures, and again at a mean time of 06:23:04 UT on June 
2, 2007, (34.2 days post burst) with the same exposure sequence.

Due to the questionable nature of the faint XRT afterglow candidate 
(Beardmore et al. GCN 6360), we searched the entire BAT error circle by 
subtracting the two epochs using ISIS2 (Alard, 2000). We do not find any 
variation between the two epochs to the limiting magnitude of the first 
epoch, J ~ 21.5. Specifically, the source within the XRT error circle 
noted by Cucchiara et al. (GCN 6368) also did not vary between the two 
epochs.
