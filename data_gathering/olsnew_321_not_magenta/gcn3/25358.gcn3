We report wide-field near-infrared follow-up observations of the localization region of the gravitational wave event S190814bv (GCN 25324, GCN 25333) by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey (Moore and Kasliwal 2019). Gattini-IR is a newly commissioned near-IR camera with a field of view of 25 square degrees mounted on a robotic 30 cm telescope at Palomar observatory.

We started customized Target of Opportunity observations at UT 2019-08-15 08:07. The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We imaged a total of 95.9 square degrees, covering 89.5% of the probability region of the event for 4 to 7 epochs until UT 2019-08-15 12:09. Each field visit consisted of a sequence of 50 dithered images each with 8 second exposures. These data were processed and stacked with the Palomar Gattini-IR data reduction pipeline (De et al., in prep.). The typical limiting magnitude of each field visit (400s second exposure time) was between 16.5 and 17.0 AB mag in J-band.  The average limiting magnitude from stacking all data taken during these observations is ~ 17.5 AB mag in J-band. No viable counterparts without previous history of variability were identified in the single epoch stacks within the survey region.
