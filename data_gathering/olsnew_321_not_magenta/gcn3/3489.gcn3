K. Yanagisawa (OAO/NAOJ), H. Toda, and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech) report on
behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 050525 (Band et al.; GCN 3466) with the
3-color MITSuME 50cm Telescope at Okayama, Japan starting at 12:03(UT)
on May 25, 2005.  We obtained a 5400 sec exposure (120 sec x 45 frames;
midtime=13:02 UT) simultaneously in V, R, and I-bands.  We confirmed
the optical afterglow (Rykoff et al.; GCN 3465) in R and I bands at
the position

	RA=18:32:32.6, DEC=+26:20:22 (J2000)

with magnitudes R = 19.30 +/- 0.17 and I = 20.12 +/- 0.29.  We did not
detect the optical transient in the V-band image with an upper limit
of V=19.2."
