Michael Garcia (Chandra X-ray Center), Luigi Piro (IAS/CNR), 
Gordon Garmire (Penn State), and Joy Nichols (Chandra X-ray Center) report:
 

The Chandra X-ray Observatory observed the GRB000210 error region
using the ACIS-S detector approximately 21 hours after the GRB (GCN
538).  Based on a preliminary analysis of a fraction of the data, we
find a source in the BeppoSAX WFC error region (GCN 539), with
co-ordinates of:

RA=01:59:14.78, DEC = -40:39:33.2 (J2000) 

approximate error radius 2 arc-sec.  Further analysis of the complete
data set may decrease the error region and should provide a flux
estimate.
