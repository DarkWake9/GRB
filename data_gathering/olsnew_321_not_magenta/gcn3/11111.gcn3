Using the data set from T-119 to T+263 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100816A (trigger #431764)
(Oates, et al., GCN Circ. 11102).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 351.738, 26.568 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  23h 26m 57.1s
    Dec(J2000) = +26d 34' 04.4"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 33%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single symmetric peak. There is
low-level ongoing emission out to about T+100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
2.9 +- 0.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.7 to T+4.5 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.73 +- 0.24,
and Epeak of 170.7 +- 79.7 keV (chi squared 50.79 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-06 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
10.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.16 +- 0.06 (chi squared 61.72 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
