   We took R-band images of GRB080330 (Hao et al. GCN 7537)
  using the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US)
  operated by the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute.
   The R-band imaging started at March 30, 06:57:55.1 UT
  (3:15:56 after the burst).

    We clearly detect the afterglow at the location reported by
  Schaefer et al. (GCN 7538).

      06:57:55.1         07:11:50.4           19.63 +- 0.05
  (3hr15m after burst) (3hr30m after burst)

  The magnitude is calibrated with a GSC2.2 star at
  (11:16:56.54, +30:37:51.4).
  The afterglow faded by more than 2 magnitudes since the
  detections shoftly after the burst (GCN 7536, 7538, 7543).
