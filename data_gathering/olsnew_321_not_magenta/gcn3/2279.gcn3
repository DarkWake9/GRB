 From 9 June 8:14 UT to 9 June 14:19 UT, the Chandra Observatory 
targeted the field of the X-ray rich GRB030528, which was localized 
by the HETE satellite (Atteia et al. GCN2256; Villasenor et al. 
GCN2261).  The 20 ksec second epoch (E2) observation with ACIS-S3 was 
a follow up to the 25 ksec first epoch (E1) observation performed 
with ACIS-S3 on 3 June (Butler et al. GCN 2269).

Of the 4 sources reported in GCN2269 lying within the revised SXC 
error region (Villasenor et al. GCN2261) and the 7 sources lying 
beyond this error region but inside the ACIS-S3 field-of-view, only 
one source declined in brightness with a significance greater than 2 
sigma:

#     Chandra Name          RA          DEC       E1 Cnts  E2 Cnts
1 CXOU J170400.3-223710  17 4 0.31  -22 37 9.99     39       8

Thus, Chandra Source #1 faded by a factor of about 4 between our two 
observations (level of significance of approximately 4 sigma; the 
implied power law decay index is 2.0 +/- 0.8). Hence, we are quite 
confident that Chandra Source #1 is indeed the X-ray afterglow of 
GRB030528. Based on the coincidence in position and moderate early 
fading in Ks reported by Greiner et  al. (GCN 2271) and the faint 
lower limit on Ks reported by Bogosavljevic et al. (GCN 2275), 
Chandra Source #1 appears to be associated with the NIR candidate 
first reported in GCN 2271.

In view of the imminent possibility of a "supernova bump" becoming 
visible from GRB030528, we urge continued deep optical and IR 
monitoring of Chandra Source #1.
