We spatially cross-matched the LIGO/Virgo G275404 trigger (90% containment;
LVC GCN 20738) with our Census of the Local Universe (CLU; Cook et al. in
prep) galaxy catalog and found 8700 galaxies. This catalog is a compilation
of galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts from many sources (e.g.,
NED, SDSS, etc) and new galaxies from a 3PI four-filter narrow-band survey
to look for redshifted Halpha emission out to 200 Mpc with the Palomar
48-inch telescope. Currently, the narrow-band survey is only calibrated
inside the footprint of SDSS. Of the 8700 galaxies in the error region,
7792 come from a compilation of known galaxies and 908 are new,
emission-line galaxy candidates.

We list here the top 20 galaxies sorted by star formation rate (SFR)
independent of distance. These SFRs are derived from GALEX all sky kron FUV
magnitudes via the prescription of Murphy et al. (2011) and have been
corrected for internal dust extinction using a combination of GALEX FUV and
22um ALLWISE fluxes (Hao et al. 2011). The quoted stellar masses are
derived from 3.4um ALLWISE fluxes and a mass-to-light ratio of 0.5 (McGaugh
& Schombert et al. 2015).
