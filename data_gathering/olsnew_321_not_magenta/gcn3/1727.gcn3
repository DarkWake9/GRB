K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Mars Odyssey GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses and HEND observed this burst at 81155 +/- 1104 s.  The
uncertainty is due to the fact that no near-Earth spacecraft has yet
reported this event.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 20 seconds with a weak tail lasting perhaps another 40
seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  1.6E-04 erg/cm2, and a
peak flux of approximately  2.9E-05 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at RA, Decl
(2000)= 328.915, -57.580 degrees, with radius 81.125 +/- 0.014
degrees.  (The uncertainty in the radius does not take into account the
fact that HEND was driven into saturation by this burst; we will
attempt to include this in later estimates).  As this annulus does not
pass near any of the known SGRs, we believe the event to be a GRB.

We are expecting confirmation of this event by a near-Earth spacecraft,
which will allow us to derive an error box for it.
