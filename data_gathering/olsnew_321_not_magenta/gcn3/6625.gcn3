J. S. Bloom notes:

"We clarify that the imaging information reported in the circular GCN  
6624 (Nugent & Bloom) refers to GRB 070714b (short-hard burst;  
Barbier et al. 6623; trigger #284856) and not GRB 070714a (short and  
XRF-like; Barthelmy et al. 6622; trigger #284850).  We apologize for  
any confusion and thank S. Barthlemy for alerting us to the citation  
error in the previous circular.

The corrected circular should read:

GRB 070714b ("Bastille"): Optical Pre-Imaging

P. Nugent (LBL) and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

"We have created a stacked image through the co-addition of 8
unfiltered images taken by the NEAT collaboration and 51 images in
the RG610 filter taken by the Palomar-Quest Consortium at the Palomar
Oschin Schmidt telescope (obtained from 2002-2006), of what is being
called a short-hard burst (SHB) 070714B (Barbier et al.; GCN #6623).
The stacked image is significantly deeper than the DSS (3 sigma limit
of R~22.7 mag). There is no source at the position of the proposed
counterpart (Melandri et al. GCN #6621). Since this Liverpool
Telescope source was detected in twilight, it was likely seen near
the DSS limit (or brighter) and thus, while we cannot say for sure
(since no magnitude was given in GCN #6621), the absence of a
similarly bright source in our image suggests that the Melandri et
al. source was indeed the afterglow.

Note that the source @ position RA = 03:51:21.24, DEC = +28:17:45.5
is in the 2MASS catalog and is blue (J - K = 0.5 mag).
