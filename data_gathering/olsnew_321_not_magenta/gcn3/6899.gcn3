We observed Swift GRB 071011 with 1.04m telescope NainiTal starting ~
4.0 hours after the burst (Marshall et al. GCN 6882). Observations were
performed in R_c and I_c filters.


Photometry of the co-added I_c frames (300 sec x 6) marginally detects
the afterglow candidate (I_c ~ 20.0) reported by Cenko S. B. (GCN 6895)
in comparison to nearby USNO stars.
