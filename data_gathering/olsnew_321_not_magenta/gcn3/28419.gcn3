S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),
C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany
and ISDC, Versoix)
and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 70 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:48:30  UT of 2020 September 14.

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.=  254.512 deg
DEC.=  -36.2914 deg

with an uncertainty of   1.5  arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 2 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s
integration
time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 3e-6  erg/cmq.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
