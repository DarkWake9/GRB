D. Xu (DARK/NBI), G.-J. Feng, H.-B. Niu, A. Esamdin, L. Ma (XAO) report:

We observed the field of the LAT error circle of GRB 131029A (Racusin
et al., GCN 15399) using the 1m telescope located at Mt. Nanshan,
Xinjiang, China, equipped with a 1.2x1.2 deg^2 CCD camera. Three
R-band frames with exposures of 180s, 240s, and 300s were obtained at
a mean time of 13.656 hr after the Fermi/LAT trigger.

At the reported three sub-threshold XRT positions (Evans, GCN 15400),
no optical transient is detected down to a limiting magnitude of
R=19.5 mag, calibrated with nearby SDSS field.
