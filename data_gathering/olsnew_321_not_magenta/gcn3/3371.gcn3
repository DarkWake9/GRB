Further to the initial Swift UVOT results (Rosen et. al. 3367) we report
the results of co-added, deeper exposures of GRB 050505 with the Swift
Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on May 06, 2005.

We detect no source at the Keck determined location  (Cenko et al, GCN 
3366) in any of the UVOT filters with the following 5 sigma and 3 sigma
limits (in 6" radius apertures)


Filter    Lim_Mag      Lim_mag   Total duration (s)   T_range (s)
           5sigma       3sigma

V          19.82        20.35        2527            2807  -  28543
B          20.50        21.04        1999            3236  -  26917
U          20.26        20.84        2890            3132  -  22757
UVW1       20.81        21.36        1999            3029  -  22040
UVM2       21.13        21.68        2422            2924  -  21132
UVW2       21.27        21.83        1997            3342  -  27826

T_range is since the BAT trigger time (Hullinger et al. 3364).

The magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured in
orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.

We note that for the estimated redshift of 4.1 - 4.3 (GCN 3368), the Lyman 
limit lies between the UVOT B and V filters - the lack of a UVOT 
detection in V may be significant, depending on the brightness of the 
source detected by Keck and the true redshift.
