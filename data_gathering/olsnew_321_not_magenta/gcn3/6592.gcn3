A very long, bright GRB triggered Konus-Wind at 2007-06-26
T0=14850.883 s UT (04:07:30.883). It was also observed by Suzaku-WAM, 
RHESSI and the MESSENGER neutron spectrometer, which also serves as a 
GRB detector.

The burst started at T-T0 ~-120 s and ended at T-T0 ~210 sec.
The Earth-crossing time of the onset was 14733 s UT (04:05:33).
The burst light curve shows several multipeaked pulses.

We have triangulated it to a 3 sigma error box whose coordinates are:

-----------------------------------------------
    RA(2000)                    Dec(2000)
-----------------------------------------------
Center:
  141.355 (09h 25m 25s)   -39.865 (-39d 51' 54")
Corners:
  139.529 (09h 18m 07s)   -39.872 (-39d 52' 20")
  142.903 (09h 31m 37s)   -40.020 (-40d 01' 11")
  143.210 (09h 32m 50s)   -39.805 (-39d 48' 17")
  139.838 (09h 19m 21s)   -39.673 (-39d 40' 24")
-------------------------------------------------

The error box area is 2047 square arcminutes.
The box may be improved.

Preliminary analysis of the Konus-Wind data yields
a burst fluence of ~4x10^-4 erg/cm2 (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range),
the spectrum of the main part of the burst (from T0 to T0+190 s)
can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.5,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.3,
the peak energy Ep = 240 keV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available
at http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB070626_T14850/

Detailed spectral parameters will be reported later.
