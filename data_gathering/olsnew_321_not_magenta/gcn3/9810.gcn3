DATE:    09/08/15 08:16:49 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and W.H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT conducted a second observation of GRB 090814B (Beckmann et
al. GCN. Circ. 9795), gathering 3.3 ks of data between T0+48 ks and
T0+60 ks. The source reported by Evans & Baumgartner (GCN Circ. 9803)
has faded to a level of 0.11 Â± 0.03 count/sec, with a power-law decay
index of alpha=0.7+/-0.3. This source is thus confirmed as the afterglow
of GRB 090814B.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020107.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
