The long-duration GRB 140330A
(Fermi LAT detection: Vianello, Kocevski, & Racusin, GCN 16048;
IPN triangulation: Hurley at al., GCN 16051)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=15594.217 s UT (04:19:54.217).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse from ~T0-3 s to ~T0+15 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 3.9(-0.5,+0.6)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.320 s,
of 1.5(-0.4,+0.4)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+16.640 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the cutoff power law with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.60(-0.45,+0.55),
and the peak energy Ep = 158(-24,+34) keV,
chi2 = 105/96 dof.
Fitting this spectrum with the Band model yields the same
values of alpha and Ep with an upper limit on beta of -3.3.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the cutoff power law with the following model parameters:
the photon index alpha = -0.18(-0.45,+0.55),
and the peak energy Ep = 172(-21,+28) keV,
chi2 = 89.2/95 dof.
