and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB 170124A (Fermi-GBM trigger #506984291; Konus-Wind trigger
time on 20:58:06.428 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at
20:58:04.58 on 24 January 2017.  The burst signal was seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two peaks.  The first peak starts at T0,
peaks at T+8 sec and ends at T+15 sec.  The second peak starts at T+15 sec,
peaks at T+23 sec and ends at T+30 sec.  The T90 duration measured by
the SGM data is 20.9 +- 1.3 sec (40-1000 keV).

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
