L. Izzo (HETH/IAA-CSIC) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 180512A (Deich et al., GCN Circ. 22710) with the 0.5m telescope of the Osservatorio Astronomico S. Di Giacomo located in Agerola, Italy ( http://acgo.it/oa )

We began observing at 22:31:54 UT (~30 min after the GRB trigger), and obtained 7x180s images in the Rc band. In our stacked image, we find no source inside the Swift-XRT error box down to a 3-sigma limit of Rc (Vega) > 20.2. The calibration was performed using nearby stars in the USNO B1 catalog.
