K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports on behalf of the ART collaboration:

 The error region of the INTEGRAL GRB 051105b (Mereghetti et
al. GCN4192) was observed by the 14 inch Automated Response Telescope. 
Imaging started at 2005 November 5, 11:07:29 UT (94 s after the
trigger) and 60 s integration in Ic band was repeated. Early data
suffered from low transparency.

 We note a bright star, SAO 215170 (V=9.0), within the INTEGRAL error
circle. While no new object is identified and the following upper
limits are derived for an optical afterglow.
