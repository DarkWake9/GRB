Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140703A (trigger #603243)
(Kocevski, et al., GCN Circ. 16503).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 13.010, 45.102 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 52m 02.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +45d 06' 07.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 14%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several peaks starting at ~T-70 sec,
peakings at ~T-50, ~T+2 & ~T+70 sec, and ending at ~T+140 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 67.1 +- 67.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.5 to T+134.8 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.74 +- 0.13.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.9 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.36 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.8 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
