O.J. Roberts (UCD) and G. Younes (USRA at GWU) report
on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:21:05.65  UT on the 30th of April 2015, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150430A
(trigger 452046068 / 150430015), which was also detected
by Swift (D'Elia  et al. 2015, GCN 17789) and MAXI/GSC
(Negoro et al. 2015, GCN 17791). The GBM on-ground location
is consistent with the Swift position. The angle from the
Fermi LAT boresight is about 110 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows several bright pulses over a
duration (T90) of 116.7 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged
spectrum from T0-4.1 s to T0+111.6 s is well fit by power
law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The
power law index is -0.95 +/- 0.15 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 346 +/- 57 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.1 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+10.3 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 9.7 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
