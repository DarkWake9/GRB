J. Kelemen (kelemen at konkoly.hu) on behalf of the GRB OT observing program
at the Konkoly Observatory.

Starting on the evening of 08/01/2014 we observed the field of GRB 140108A
(Racusin et al., GCN 15699) 8802 sec. after the burst, using a 60/90/180 cm
Schmidt telescope located at the Mountain Station of the Konkoly
Observatory, equipped with an Apogee CCD camera through R filter. On the coadded
R images (total exp.time 900 sec) we marginally detected the OT at the
position indicated the finding chart provided by Pozarenko, GCN 15704.
Based on the nearby UCAC-4 stars we provide 22.6 +/- 0.3 magnitude in the R
band for the OT.
