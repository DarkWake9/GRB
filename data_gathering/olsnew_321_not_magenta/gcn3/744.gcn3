TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB000630, optical observations

S. Yost, F. Harrison and A. Burgasser (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We imaged the entire error box of GRB000630 (Hurley, GCN 736) with the
CCD 13 instrument of the Palomar 60". Exposures consisted of R-band 4X900
seconds on the half of the error box containing the positions of Bertolini
et. al.'s optical candidate (GCN 737) and Berger & Frail's radio source
(GCN 738), and 2X900 seconds on the other half, on July 1.23 UT. The
seeing was approximately 0.9". Preliminary analysis reveals no objects at
either the optical or the radio candidate positions, to an approximate
limiting magnitude of R ~ 22.5. We will report a more precise limit
after further calibration of the field."
