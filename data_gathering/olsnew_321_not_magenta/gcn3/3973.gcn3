TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3973
SUBJECT: GRB050914: XRT position probably due to cosmic ray
DATE:    05/09/14 12:06:57 GMT
FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <kpa@star.le.ac.uk>

O. Godet, K. Page, J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), J. Kennea (PSU) and D.
Burrows (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The XRT began observing at 11:28:54 UT, 99 seconds after the BAT
trigger (BAT trigger 155072). The postage stamp image looks like a
cosmic ray rather than an X-ray source. The XRT light-curve terminated
after 2.7 seconds, before the spacecraft entered the SAA.
