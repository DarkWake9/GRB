Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC), report:
"Between Apr. 1.167 UT and Apr. 1.277, we made near-infrared observations
of a region of the sky that includes the entire SAX NFI error box 
for GRB 980329 (IAUC 6853, 6854), using the GRIM II instrument 
mounted on the ARC 3.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory.
At the epoch Apr. 1.167-1.177 and at a position R.A. = 7h02m38s.7, 
Decl.= +38o50'27" (J2000.0) consistent with that of the R=20.6 object 
reported in IAUC 6856, we find an object of magnitude J = 17.7 +/- 0.1.
This object is approximately 6.4" South and 3.0" West of the bright
R=15.8 star reported in IAUC 6856, for which we measure J = 13.9 +/- 0.1.
At the epoch Apr. 1.267-1.277 (approximately 2.5 hours later),
we find no measurable change (less than approximately 0.1 mag)
in the J magnitude of the object."
