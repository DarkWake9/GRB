Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110106B (trigger #441676)
(Sbarufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 11525).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 134.155, 47.005 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 56m 37.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +47d 00' 17.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows 3 main overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-6 sec and ending at ~T+23 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 24.8 +- 4.8 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-10.8 to T+23.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.76 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+4.87 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
