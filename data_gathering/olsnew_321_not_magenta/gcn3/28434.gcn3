Swift observed the field of IceCube 200911A (GCN Circ. 28411) between 
16:38:01
2020 September 9 and 19:38:41 on 2020 September 9, collecting a total of 
3.7 ks of
cleaned photon counting (PC) mode data. The observations used a 4-point 
tiling
pattern with a radius of ~0.3 degrees.

We found no X-ray sources beyond artifacts caused by bright Earth limb 
contamination.

The 3-sigma upper limit in the field was in the range 5-8 x10^-3 ct/sec.
