J. Schaefer, S. Savage, R. Canterna (U. Wyoming), M. Nysewander, and D.
Reichart (U. North Carolina) report:

We observed the inner 90% of the 40-arcminute diameter error circle of GRB
021112 (GCN 1682) with the 0.6-meter Red Buttes Observatory telescope
beginning 1.8 hours after the burst.  We integrated without filter for 1800
seconds per pointing x four pointings.

Visual comparison with the DSS2-Red reveals no obvious counterpart to the
limiting magnitude of the DSS.

[GCN OPS NOTE (13nov02):  The Circ 1683 reference was changed to 1682.]
