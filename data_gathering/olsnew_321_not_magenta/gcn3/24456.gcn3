Gergely Dálya and Peter Raffai (Eotvos Univ.) reports on behalf of the GLADE
team:

We have found 17,197 galaxies in the GLADE catalog [1,2], within the
updated 90% GW
localization area (LALInference.fits.gz) reported by the LVC in GCN 24448,
and within 227 +/- 92 Mpc distance limits.

The galaxies found can be accessed on the GLADE website (4.6 MB txt file;
please note that the order of galaxies in the list only follow the ordering
as the appear in GLADE):

There are 353 galaxies within the 50% GW localization area and within
the same distance limits (97 kB txt file; please note that the order of
galaxies in the list only follow the ordering as the appear in GLADE):
