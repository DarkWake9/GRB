S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC, MSSL-UCL) and M.E. Gropp (PSU) report 
on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3124 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. We note that within the XRT error 
circle (Perri et al., GCN Circ. 16832) there is a point source which is also 
observed in the DSS. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of the BAT error circle. 
The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6mag. The 8'x8' region for the 
list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle. The 
list of sources is typically complete to about 18mag. 

No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.09.
