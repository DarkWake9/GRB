R.L.C. Starling (U. Leicester) and P. Schady (MSSL-UCL) report on behalf 
of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the Swift XRT X-ray light curve out to T0+162 ks for GRB 
080707 (trigger=316204, Schady et al., GCN Circ. 7947). The light curve 
can be fit with a multiply broken power law as described in GCN Circ. 
7951, and we note a possible further break. A fit including this possible 
break places it at (9 +6/-8)e4 s and the current decay rate is then 
approximately alpha=2.2.
The Swift XRT light curve can be viewed in the on-line repository (Evans 
et al. 2007) at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/00316204/

Swift XRT continues to observe this source to constrain the current decay 
and confirm/reject the presence of a late-time break. Ground-based optical 
observations are strongly encouraged.

This is an official product of the Swift XRT team.
