on behalf of the Hobby-Eberly telescope GRB follow-up team:

"We obtained a spectrum of GRB 000301C with the Low-Resolution
Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope on March 4.410. The
spectrum, which was taken under non-ideal weather and seeing
conditions, covers the range 4100-8000 A.  We detect no obvious
emission or absorption features. The flux density per unit frequency
interval (f-nu) appears to increase monotonically toward the red."
