P. Garnavich (Notre Dame), J. L. Prieto, R. Pogge (OSU) report:

We observed the position of GRB 080310 (Chornock et al. GCN 7381;
Cummings et al., GCN 7382) with the Large Binocular Telescope and
LBC red and blue cameras starting at 9:04 (UT) (0.44 hours
after the burst) and ending 1 hour after the burst. Observations
were obtained approximately every minute. The initial pair of
observations showed no significant decay, but then declined
rapidly into a power-law with a decay index of 0.65
(see Cobb et al., GCN 7386).
