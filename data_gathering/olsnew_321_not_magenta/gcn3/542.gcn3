GRB000210: possible afterglow detection with BeppoSAX NFI

E. Costa, G. Gandolfi, L. Piro, IAS/CNR, Roma, M.J.S. Smith, Space
Research Organization of the Netherlands (SRON), Utrecht, C. Guidorzi,
Universita' di Ferrara, D. Ricci, G. Tassone and A. Coletta, Scientific
Operation Center, Telespazio, Roma, report:

"A BeppoSAX follow-up of GRB000210 started about 8 hr after the burst. A
very preliminary quick look analysis of the first three orbits of the MECS
data at SOC shows an object, previously unknown, inside the refined error
circle of the WFC, without any evidence of decaying behaviour. The source 
flux is of the order of 5x10E-13 erg sE-1 cmE-2."
