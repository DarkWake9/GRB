V.Rumyantsev (CrAO) and A.Pozanenko (IKI) report:

We have obtained 70 unfiltered images (120 s exposure each) of the GRB040229
error box (RXTE-ASM  GRB040229). The images were taken with the AT-64
telescope  of Crimean Astrophysical observatory and cover the period  UT
22:04 Mar. 1 - 01:44 Mar. 2, 2004.  We used CCD SBIG ST-8 with maximum of
sensitivity in the red spectral band.  No afterglow candidate was  found in
comparison with DSS2. We estimated the limiting magnitudes of combined
images (S/N=3) as following

Start time (UT)       telescope   exposure    limiting mag.
Mar. 29  22:04        AT-64     10x120 s      20.0
