D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley), J. Meyers, E. Hsiao, N. Suzuki, P. Nugent, 
S. Perlmutter (LBNL), S. B. Cenko, and J. S. Bloom (UCB) report:

We acquired imaging of the field of short-hard burst GRB 100216A 
(Cummings et al., GCN 10428) on 2010-02-19 starting at 07:31 UT, using 
LRIS on Keck 1.  A total of 660 seconds of imaging was acquired in 
R-band and 900 seconds in g-band simultaneously.  The imaging covers 
approximately 90% of the BAT error circle including the nearby galaxy 
mentioned in GCN 10428, a barred spiral at z=0.0378.  In a preliminary 
reduction of the R-band frames we identify no new source within the 
field, down to the SDSS limit of approximately R>22 mag.
