A bright long multipeak GRB 050326 (Swift-BAT trigger 111453, GCN 3143)
triggered Konus-Wind at 35633.347 s UT (09:53:53.347).
As observed by Konus-Wind, it had a duration of ~38 s,
fluence (3.22 ± 0.05)10-5 erg/cm2, peak flux (6.0 ± 0.3)10-6 erg/cm2 s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).
Time-integrated spectrum of the burst is fitted with the GRB
(Band) model. The low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.74 ± 0.09,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.49 ± 0.16,
and the break energy E0 = 160 ± 22 keV.
The peak energy is Ep = 201 ± 24 keV.
