The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 03:18:31 UT on 25 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200325A (trigger 606799116.742442 / 200325138).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 22.1, Dec = -29.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 28m, -29d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 102.0 degrees.
