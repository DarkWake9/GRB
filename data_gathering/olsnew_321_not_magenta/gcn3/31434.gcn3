The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:21:49 UT on 11 Jan 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220111A (trigger 663621714.433092 / 220111807).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 149.1, Dec = 0.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 56m, 0d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70.0 degrees.
