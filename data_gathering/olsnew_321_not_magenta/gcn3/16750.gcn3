A. von Kienlin, X. Zhang, A. Rau, V. Savchenko, E. Bozzo, and C.
Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140824B (Zhang, GCN 16743) has
been observed by Konus-Wind, Fermi(GBM trigger 430583595), and INTEGRAL 
(SPI-ACS), so far, at about 52392 s UT (14:33:12).

We have triangulated it to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=355.371 deg (23h 41m 29s)  Dec(2000)=-1.147 deg (-1d 08' 51"),
whose radius is 61.534 ± 1.149 deg (3 sigma).

The OT reported by MASTER (Tyurina et al., GCNs 16740, 16741) is well 
outside of the annulus (at 3.6 deg from the annulus center line). 
Therefore, we conclude that this OT is not related to the burst (as was 
already suggested by Tyurina et al. (GCN 16741) and Pagani et al. (GCN 
16746) basing on the optical observations).
