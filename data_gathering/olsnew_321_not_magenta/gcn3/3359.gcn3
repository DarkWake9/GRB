J. A. Kennea, D. N. Burrows (PSU), K. Page, C. P. Hurkett (U. 
Leicester), B. Zhang (UNLV) and N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of 
the Swift XRT team:

INTEGRAL detected GRB050504 at 08:00:52 UT on 4th May 2005 (GCN Circ 
3348). The Swift observatory executed an Target of Opportunity observation 
of the INTEGRAL position and the XRT began taking data at 13:27:40 UT. 
In ground processing of 9218s of Photon Counting mode data we detect a 
faint uncataloged X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 13:24:01.3,
Dec(J2000) = +40:42:12

We estimate an uncertainty of 6.9 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 35 arcseconds from the INTEGRAL position reported in GCN 
3348.
