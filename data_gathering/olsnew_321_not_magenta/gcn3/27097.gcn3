The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 09:07:25 UT on 16 Feb 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200216A (trigger 603536850.030844 / 200216380).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 318.7, Dec = 6.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 14m, 6d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 68.0 degrees.
