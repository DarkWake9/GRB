Gendre B. (ARTEMIS/IRAP), Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP),
Boer M. (CNRS-ARTEMIS), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130216A detected by SWIFT (trigger 548927, 
Melandri et al., GCN 14223) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) 
located at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 1.96h after the GRB trigger. The elevation of 
the field decreased from 44 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2013-02-16T22:15:24.620

The first image is trailed with a duration of 180.0s (see the 
description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39). We do not detect any 
OT with a limiting magnitude of: t0+7048.3s to t0+7228.3s : R > 15.1

The second image is 180.0s exposure in tracking mode: t0+7238.9s to 
t0+7418.9s : R > 16.2

We co-added a series of exposures: t0+7238.9s to t0+8399.0s : R > 17.7

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars and are not 
corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=181.8416 lat=-22.2057 and the galactic 
extinction in R band is 0.3 magnitudes estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 
1998ApJ...500..525S.
