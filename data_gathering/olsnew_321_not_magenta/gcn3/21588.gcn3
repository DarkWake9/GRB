We are observing the optical transient SSS17a (Coulter et al. - GCN 21529, Allam et al. - GCN 21530, Yang et al.- GCN 21531, Melandri et al. - GCN 21532) and its host galaxy NGC 4993 with the Very Long Baseline Array.

 
We are observing at a central frequency of 8.7 GHz with a bandwidth of 256 MHz.

The first observation took place from 2017-08-17 19:58UT to 2017-08-18 01:34UT.  

Analysis of the data will take place after correlation, in 7-10 days.  

Two subsequent epochs are planned in the coming three days.

We thank the Long Baseline Observatory staff for facilitating these observations.
