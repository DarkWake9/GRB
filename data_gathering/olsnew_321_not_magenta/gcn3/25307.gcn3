Burrows (PSU), J. D. Gropp (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), J.P.
Osborne (U. Leicester), A. Melandri (INAF-OAB) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the HAWC-detected
candidate GRB 19086A (GCN Circ. 25284) in a series of observations
tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 3.8 ks, distributed over 4
tiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location was 2.6 ks. The
data were collected between T0+25.6 ks and T0+32.8 ks, and are entirely
in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

Five uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of
them is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading.
Therefore, at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the
afterglow. Further observations are planned.

Details of these sources are given below:
