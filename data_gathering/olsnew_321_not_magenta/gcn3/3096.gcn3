E. Berger (Carnegie Observatories) and D.B. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf
of the Carnegie-Caltech-NRAO collaboration:
 
"On 2005, February 24.09 UT we obtained near-infrared spectra with GNIRS
on the Gemini-south telescope of the NIR afterglow of GRB 050219b,
identified in images from the Las Campanas 100-inch telescope (see also
GCN 3064). As reported in GCN 3064 (also GCN 3052: UVOT limits), the NIR
afterglow is significantly brighter than optical limits obtained
contemporaneously, suggesting a large dust extinction or a high redshift
(z>5) origin.
 
Using Director's Discretionary time we obtained a total of 4800 sec on
source in the cross-dispersed mode which covers the range of 1-2.5 microns
in six echelle orders (R~1700).  No continuum or emission lines were
detected in the combined 2-d spectrum.
 
We thank Phil Puxley, Gemini South Associate Director, for the allocation
of DD time, and Claudia Winge for extensive help with the Phase I/II setup
and the observations."
