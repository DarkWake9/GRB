A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (IKI),  E. Klunko (ISTP), K. Kamyshnikov 
(HSE), N. Pankov (HSE),  E. Mazaeva (IKI), S. Belkin (IKI)  report   on 
behalf of GRB IKI FuN:

We observed the field of  GRB 200115A (Cenko et al.  GCN 26771) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting on Jan. 15 (UT) 
  11:55:00, i.e. 4.6 minutes after GRB trigger.  Within  BAT 
ground-calculated position (Laha et al. GCN 26780) we   detected the 
only one unidentified object at the coordinates (J2000) 03:45:46.58 
+05:36:36 with uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec in both coordinates. The object 
is absent in SDSS DR12. At this time we cannot confirm variability of 
the object.   We suggest the object is the optical afterglow  of GRB 
200115A. Preliminary photometry of the afterglow candidate is following.
