We report on the detection of near infrared afterglow of GRB 050319 using
NICMOS camera coupled with 1.2m telescope of Physical Research Laboratory
at Gurushikar, Mt.Abu, India. 
The observations  started at 15:41:00 UT on 19 March in J-band filter at
a 4'* 4' field of view shows a probable Infrared candidate at the error
region of optical afterglow candidate (GCN 3116 & 3117). 
We had taken a net fourty minute exposure and the source which was present
in our first 20s frame was found to be faded down to our observational
limits with in 4min (four frames of  each 60s exposure).
Preliminary analysis and on  comparison with two near by stars present in
our field shows that the near infrared afterglow candidate corresponds to
a J-band magnitude ~ 13 at 15:41:20 UT
