Brajesh Kumar, Ram Kesh Yadav, S.B. Pandey and V.K. Bhatt (ARIES, Nainital,
India, on behalf of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

GRB 121117A (Cummings et al., GCN 13967) field was observed with the 1.3m
Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope at Nainital. Three images in R_c pass-band
(300 sec each) starting at 2012-11-17 14:35:26 (UT) were acquired. In the
co-added R_c frame (300sec x 3), we did not detect the optical source
(Oates et al., GCN 13973) down to a limiting magnitude of ~20.5 mag
(in comparison to nearby USNO- B1 stars).
