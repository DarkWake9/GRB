The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 01:22:24.93 UT on 26 Mar 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210326A (trigger 638414549.926002 / 210326057).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 58.0, Dec = +15.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 52m, +15d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 39.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69.0 degrees.
