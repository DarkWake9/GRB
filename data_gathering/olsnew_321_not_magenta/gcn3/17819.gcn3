O.J. Roberts (UCD), Bin-Bin Zhang (UAH) and
C.Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 18:35:05.35 UT on the 14th of May 2015, the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 150514A
(trigger 453321308 / 150514774), which was also detected
by Fermi-LAT (Kocevski et al. 2015, GCN 17816). An
afterglow likely to be from this event was also found by
Swift (Kennea et al. 2015, GCN 17818). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the LAT and Swift XRT positions.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is about 38 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single bright, FRED-like
pulse over a duration (T90) of 10.8 s (50-300 keV). The
time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+11.3 s is well
fit by a Band function, with an Epeak = 73 +/- 6 keV,
alpha = -1.34 +/- 0.07, and beta = -2.51 +/- 0.17.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.9 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon
flux measured starting from T0+0.5 s in the 10-1000 keV
band is 19.9 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
