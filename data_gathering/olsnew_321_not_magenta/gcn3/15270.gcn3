Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130929A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 572308) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 38.0s after the GRB trigger
(15.1s after the notice). The elevation of the field increased from
45 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were partially cloudy.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+38.0s to t0+98.0s : Rlim = 13.6

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+112s to t0+142s : Rlim = 14.4

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+112s to t0+303s : Rlim = 15.1

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby NOMAD1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=268.1127 lat= -0.9424
and the galactic extinction in R band is about 8 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
