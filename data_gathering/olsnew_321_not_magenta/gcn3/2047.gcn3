report:

We selected from the GCN literature all available R-band data of the
afterglow of GRB 030329 (including the unfiltered ROTSE data; Rykoff
and Smith, GCN 1995). We fitted the afterglow light curve using the
standard Beuermann equation (A&A 352, L26). The result is: alpha_1 =
0.85 +/- 0.07, alpha_2 = 1.45 +/- 0.09, t_break = 0.39 +/- 0.06
days. The substantial re-brightening reported by Lipkin et al.  (GCN
2045) and Burenin et al. (GCN 2046) seems to be similar to that seen
in the afterglow light curve of GRBs 000301C and 021004. A plot including
a predicted supernova component and assuming a negligible contribution
from an underlying host galaxy is available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.tls-tautenburg.de, dir /pub/klose/10/. A multi-color plot is
available at http://www.physics.unc.edu/~mnysewan/grb030329.html.
