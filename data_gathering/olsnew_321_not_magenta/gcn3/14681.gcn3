SUBJECT: GRB 130518A: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow.

P.A. Evans (U.Leicester), M.C. Stroh (PSU) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift has performed a second observation of GRB 130518A. We collected
1 ks of data, starting 122.5 ks after the Fermi trigger (Xiong, GCN
Circ. 14674; Omodei & McEnery, GCN Circ. 14675). The XRT source reported
by Evans et al. (GCN Circ. 14678) is detected at a level of 0.013 Â±
0.005 ct/sec, significantly below the level in the previous
observations, confirming that it has faded. The best-fitting power-law
decay index is 1.1 (+0.5, -0.3).

We therefore conclude that this object is the afterglow of GRB 130518A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
