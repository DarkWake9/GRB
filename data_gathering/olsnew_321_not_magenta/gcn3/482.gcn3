TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  482
SUBJECT: GRB 991217
DATE:    99/12/18 01:50:10 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports that there is an asteroid
currently moving through the SAX error box, about two arcmin
south of the center, in an easterly direction.  Short exposures
might confuse the naive observer into thinking a new object
is present.
