SUBJECT: GRB 180923B - GBM Correction to GCN 23263

O.J. Roberts (USRA) reports on behalf of the GBM Team:

In GCN 23263, the incorrect GRB ID was used. 

All references to GRB 180923A in this GCN are incorrect and should read as 180923B. 

GRB 180923A was already detected by MAXI earlier that day (GCN 23257), 
and used in subsequent GCNs (23258 and 23259).

My apologies for any confusion this error may have caused.
