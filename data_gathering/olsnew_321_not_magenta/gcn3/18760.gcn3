We report the spectral lag analysis for GRB 151229A (Kocevski, et al.,
GCN Circ. 18745, & Lien 18751) based on the BAT data.  Using 8-ms binned light curve,
the spectral lag for the 25-50 keV to 100-300 keV bands is -47.6 +/-31 ms and
+12 +/-24 for the 15-25 to 50-100 bands.  Although the errors are large,
the values are marginally consistent with zero, therefore we believe
this burst belongs to a short burst category, although we can not rule out
the long burst possibility.  There is no evidence for extended emission.
