K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Mereghetti, J. Borkowski, and D. Gotz, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
IBIS GRB team, report:

Further analysis of this event indicates that the IPN annulus (GCN 1841)
is consistent with the error circle given in GCN 1838, but cannot in
fact be used to constrain it.  The error box given in GCN 1841 should be 
disregarded.
