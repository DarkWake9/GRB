Following GCN #18442 on the possible GW event G194575, we
observed its secondary probability density region with
Mini-MegaTORTORA nine-channel wide-field monitoring system
(located at Special Astrophysical Observatory near Russian 6-m
telescope) starting on 2015-10-22 22:33:24 UT under bad weather
conditions.

The system field of view has been centered on RA, Dec = 16.8, 5.7
covering roughly 900 square degrees simultaneously. Coverage map
of all nine channels is shown at
http://mmt.favor2.info/scheduler/761/lvc

Every channel acquired 10 x 60s exposure images in white light
between 2015-10-22 22:33:24 UT and 2015-10-22 22:42:31 UT,
further observations interrupted due to heavy clouds. The
footprints of acquired images are uploaded to GraceDB.

Quick-look analysis did not reveal any transient brighter than
V~13.5 magnitude in the data.
