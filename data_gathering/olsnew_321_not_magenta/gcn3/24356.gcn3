Igor Andreoni (Caltech), Eric Bellm (UW) report on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations

 

We searched for Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detections associated with Gaia19bpt AT2019ehz (Kostrzewa-Rutkowska et al., GCN 24354) in the archive of ZTF alerts.  A source, dubbed ZTF19aarioci, was found varying at the location of Gaia19bpt.  The source was first detected in ZTF data on 2019-04-21 (g ~ 19.8), with detections in the public surveys beginning on 2019-04-23.

 

The optical event was detected days before the gravitational wave trigger S190425z (LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, GCN 24168), therefore we exclude an association between Gaia19bpt AT2019ehz and S190425z.
