behalf of the HETE GRB team, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), and HETE (FREGATE)  observed
this GRB at 67228 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration
of approximately 10 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  7.4E-07 erg/cm2 s over
0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 341.187, -22.949 degrees, whose radius is 76.591 +/-  0.143
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
