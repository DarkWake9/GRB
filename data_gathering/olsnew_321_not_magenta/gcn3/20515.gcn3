K. Wiersema (Leicester) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have performed V band tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G270580 (LVC, GCN
20486) using the 0.5m telescope (UL50) of the University of Leicester,
between 19:00 UT on 20 jan 2017 and  00:30 on 21 jan 2017 (i.e. starting
6.5 hours after the LIGO event).
These consist of shallow, many-tile, mosaics of ~1 square degree centered
on some nearby galaxies from the GWGC catalogue, in particular UGC
03804 (RA=110.6,Dec=71.6), UGC 05295 (RA=142.2,Dec=42.8), and covering
galaxies near those positions. No credible transient candidates brighter
than V=17.0 were detected (but analysis is ongoing). In addition we
observed several other GWGC catalogue sources using smaller fields
of view (12x9 arc min) at a deeper limiting magnitude, e.g. NGC3009,
NGC3032, UGC03804. No transient candidates brighter than V=18.5 were
found near or in these galaxies. We do detect
MASTER OT J090737.22+611200.5 (Lipunov et al., GCN 20488), at
V~19.5 on 23:19 UT on 21 jan 2017.
