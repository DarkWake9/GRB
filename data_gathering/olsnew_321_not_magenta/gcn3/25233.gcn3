FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

R. Hamburg (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 190730A (GCN 25225),
the reported position:

RA: 225.79 (+1.28 -1.43 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: +10.47 (+1.14 -0.89 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately 6 minutes
prior until 30 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM observations
are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
