This corrects the classification of 27 Swift-BAT triggers since the beginning
of the mission.  In a few cases over the two year period, we did not issue
retraction announcements when there should have been one (in either Notice or
Circular form), for various reasons (e.g. we got busy with the next trigger,
we did not believe it was a non-GRB until just recently, or we just plain
forgot).

In some cases the classification issued in the real-time notice was wrong. 
For example, some notices said a trigger was cause by a GRB when in fact it
was a known source in a variable state, but the source was not in the catalog
used for the real-time notices.  In other cases the real-time classification
was indecisive (i.e. it contained words like "possible").  We apologize for
any inconvenience that the original incorrect classifications may have caused. 

In a few cases we thought we did not need to retract the trigger because we
thought nobody outside the Swift team was notified, when in fact partial
sets of Notices went out to the community.  A hole in the GCN Notice filtering
code was allowing the FOM_OBS and SC_SLEW Notices to be distributed to the
world.  That filtering code correctly blocked the bogus BAT_POS and
BAT_LIGHTCURVE Notices, but allowed the other two through.

The table below contains the Trigger Number, the Trigger Date and Time,
and a Comment about what we are currently classifying the trigger.
