TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1391
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of a burst from SGR1806-20
DATE:    02/05/16 00:18:36 GMT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and 

D. Smith, R. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas,
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team, report:

Ulysses and RHESSI observed a burst on May 15 at 01:26:41 UT with ~20
ms duration.  Triangulation gives an annulus which is consistent with
the position of SGR1806-20.  Ulysses has in addition observed numerous
short events over the past several days.  Although none could be
triangulated, this may suggest that SGR1806-20 is entering a new period
of activity.
