Using the data set from T-240 to T+300 sec from the recent telemetry downlink, 
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110223A (trigger #446674) 
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 11753).  The BAT ground-calculated position is 
RA, Dec = 345.386, 87.586 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 01m 32.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +87d 35' 11.3" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 60%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like peak at ~T+0.5 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) 
is 7.0 +- 2.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.1 to T+8.1 sec is best fit by a simple 
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 
1.70 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.08 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 
0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
