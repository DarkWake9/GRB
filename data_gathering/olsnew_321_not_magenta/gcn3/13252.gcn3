(IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), A. J. Levan (U Warwick), P. Jakobsson (U.
Iceland), E. Wuyts (KIPAC Chicago) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 120422A (Troja et al., GCN 13243) with
the Nordic Opitcal Telescope (NOT) equipped with MOSCA. We obtained 12
x 300 s I-band images. Observations started at 20:54 UT on April 22
(i.e., 13.3 hrs after the burst).

We clearly detected the source reported in Cucchiara et al. (GCN
13245) in all individual images. There was no significant fading
during observations. The source has an I-band brightness of 21.7 mag
(Vega magnitude) in the stacked image. This value is not corrected for
foreground extinction and calibrated with the #1039-0167772 star (I =
18.98 mag) in the USNO B1 catalogue.
