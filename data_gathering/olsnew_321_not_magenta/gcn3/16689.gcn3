GRB 140814A: Swift-XRT and UVOT observations 

A. Vargas, V. Mangano, M. Siegel (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift team.
Please disregard GCN Circ. 16887, which was sent in error. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Swift began observing the field of GRB 140814A  (Uchida et al,.  GCN Circ. 16686) on 2014-08-14 at 13:35:33 UT, 22 ks after the MAXI/GSC trigger. Swift performed tiled observations of four contiguous fields, centered on the MAXI error ellipse, with an exposure of 1 ks per field. Our mosaic covers the whole elliptical MAXI error circle (Uchida et al., GCN Circ. 16686). 
In the XRT exposure, we do not find any new source, down to a three sigma upper limit of 3e-03 cts/s. 

UVOT began observing the field 22 ks after the MAXI/GSC trigger.  Observations of 871-937 seconds per tile were obtained in the u filter. No new source was detected down to a limiting magnitude of 20.

This circular is an official product of the Swift team.
