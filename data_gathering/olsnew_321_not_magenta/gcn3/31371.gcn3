R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu, et al., GCN 31347) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the Teide, Tenerife site, on January 2, from 21:41 to 22:03 UT (corresponding to 40.53 to 40.90 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel R and I filters.

We performed a series of 3x400s exposures in R and I bands. We clearly detect the source at the UVOT detection coordinates and other optical observations (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 31347; Kuin & Tohuvavohu, GCN 31351; Fu et al., GCN 31353; Hentunen et al., GCN 31356;
Perley et al., GCN 31357; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 31358; Fynbo et al., GCN 31359; Vinko et al., GCN 31361; Tomasella et al., GCN 31363; Mao et al., GCN 31364; Noschese et al., GCN 31366; Mao et al., GCN 31368) in both bands. The following magnitudes are calculated using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference:

R=19.76+/-0.11
I=18.03+/-0.13

These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.
