J. S. Bloom, F. Marchis (UCB), K Smalley, E. E. Falco, C. Blake  
(CfA), N. Bulter, and R. Foley (UCB) report:

"With high winds and poor transmission on Mt. Hopkins we observed the  
field of GRB 060123 (Palmer et al., GCN 4584) both with the PAIRITEL  
1.3m and the 48" telescope equipped with Keplercam. At time 25.3 Jan  
2006 UT we find no significantly new source in i, z, J, H, Ks within  
the XRT error circle when compared with SDSS (Cool et al. GCN 4585).  
Imaging in I and z' under better conditions at the Lick 3m + PFCam on  
Mt. Hamilton began at 25.3 Jan 2006 UT: analysis is still in progress  
but we confirm the conclusion of Cenko et al. (GCN 4594) that there  
is no evidence for a new optical source to the SDSS limits.  We do  
note that there is a faint (z_AB = 19.87 mag) apparent galaxy (SDSS  
J115847.6+453050.8) on the northern outskirts of the 90% containment  
XRT error circle at J2000: 11:58:47.59, +45:30:50.8."
