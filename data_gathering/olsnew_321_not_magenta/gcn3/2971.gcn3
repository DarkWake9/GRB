Z.Y. Lin, K.Y. Huang, W.H. Ip (NCU), Y. Urata, T. Tamagawa (RIKEN),
Y. Qiu (BAO), Y.Q. Lou(THCA) on behalf of the East Asian collaboration
report:

"We have observed the GRB 050123 error range reported by Hurley et
al.(GCN 2966) using Lulin 1-m telescope at Taiwan. Our observations
with I band started from 15.87 UT to 16.72 UT (~5.49 to 5.79 hours
after the burst). These images cover 70 % error region of GRB 050123
(Hurley et al., GCN 2966).  Comparing DSS-II image, no candidate was
detected in our I band images. The average of limiting magnitude is
about 19 (S/N=3, compared with USNO-B1 I magnitude)."
