Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR), A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR), Dipankar Bhattacharya (IUCAA), S. Bradley Cenko (NASA) and Alessandra Corsi (Texas-Tech) report:

We observed GRB 180720B (Siegel et al. GCN 22973) with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at the 1.4 GHz band on 2018 Jul 29.99 UT. We detect a radio afterglow with the flux density of ~370+/-59 uJy at the optical position (Martone et al. GCN 22976). 

We thank the staff of the GMRT that made these observations possible. GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. More observations are planned.
