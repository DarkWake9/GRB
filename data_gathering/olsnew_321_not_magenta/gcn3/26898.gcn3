The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:11:18 UT on 27 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200127B (trigger 601841483.670522 / 200127758).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 75.9, Dec = 20.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 03m, 20d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 55.0 degrees.
