L. Elenin (ISON),  A. Pozanenko (IKI), I. Molotov (KIAM) report on behalf of 
larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 111029A (Swift trigger 506519; Troja et al., 
GCN 12498) with 0.45-m telescope Ïf ISON-NM observatory  starting in 
automatic response mode on  Oct. 29 (UT) 09:47:47, i.e. 187 s after burst 
trigger.  We took 31 unfiltered images.  We do not detect any source within 
XRT error circle.   The photometry of a single and co-added frames is based 
on the USNO-B1.0  nearby stars (R magnitudes):
