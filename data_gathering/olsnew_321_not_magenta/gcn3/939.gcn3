"We observed the BeppoSAX WFC error circle of GRB 010214 
(Gandolfi, GCN #933) with the AZT-24 1.1-meter telescope 
at Campo Imperatore (AQ), Italy.

The J-band observation started at February 15.17928 UT and 
the field was imaged for a total exposure time of 2550 sec. 
We detected a faint point-like source which is not present 
in the Digital Sky Survey-2 IR, R and B plates nor the
2MASS plates. The source is located at:

    RA(J2000)=   17h 40m 54.0s
    DEC(J2000)= +48d 32' 20"
    (uncertainty is 2")

This position lies within the WFC error circle (GCN #933)
and is just outside the BeppoSAX NFI error circle quoted
by Gandolfi GCN #937.

The source was detected with a S/N=12 and had a magnitude of 
J=19.1+/-0.3.

Further observations are needed in order to confirm that this 
is the IR counterpart of GRB 010214.
