The long GRB 141130A (Swift-BAT trigger #620090: Vargas et al., GCN 17120;
Lien et al., GCN 17127) was detected by Konus-Wind in the waiting mode.

The burst light curve shows a double-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~85 s (from ~T0(BAT)-44 s to ~T0(BAT)+41 s).

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
8.79(-2.39,+2.62)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 2.944 s peak flux,
measured from ~T0(BAT)-2.725 s, of 2.40(-0.82,+0.87)x10^-7 erg/cm2/s
(both estimated in the 20 keV - 10  MeV energy range).

Modeling the KW 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0(BAT)-43.941 s to T0(BAT)+41.435 s) by a power law
with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha =-1.49 Â± 0.18,
and Ep =307(-108,+467) keV.

All the quoted values are preliminary.
