J. Haislip, C. MacLeod and J. Kirschbrown report on behalf of the UNC team
of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We observed the error region of GRB 060115 (Tagliaferri et al., GCN 4509)
with four of the PROMPT telescopes simultaneously in UBr'i'Iz' beginning
11.7 hours after the burst under the automated control of SkyNet.  Each
exposure is 80 s long; the table below gives details of the observations:

Filter Telescope  Start (UT) Stop (UT)    # Exp   Total (hr)
 U       P2       00:48:44   04:54:24     165     3.67
 B       P5       02:14:13   03:37:52     58      1.29
 r'      P4       00:48:46   04:54:34     110     2.44
 I       P1       00:50:31   04:56:38     168     3.73
 i'      P4       02:14:12   03:37:53     58      1.29
 z'      P5       00:48:46   04:54:36     110     2.44

At a mean time of 13.6 hours after the burst, we do not detect the
afterglow (Yanagisawa et al., GCN 4510) down to a 3-sigma limiting
magnitude of r' = 21.5 based on 5 NOMAD-VR magnitudes transformed to r' via
the equations given in Smith et al. (2002).

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned at CTIO.
