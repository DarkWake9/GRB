SUBJECT: GRB 130418A: CARMA 3mm detection
DATE:    13/04/19 03:49:53 GMT

D. A. Perley (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 130418A (De Pasquale et al., GCN 14377) 
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy at a 
frequency of 93 GHz (3mm) starting at 02:50 UT on 2013-04-19, 7.82 hours 
after the burst.  Observations continued until 03:26 UT (midpoint t=8.12 
hours.)

A source is clearly detected at a position consistent with the location 
of the UV, X-ray, and optical afterglow (De Pasquale et al., GCN 14377; 
Gorosabel et al., GCN 14378; Quardri et al., GCN 14379).  The 
approximate flux at this time is ~3 mJy.  Follow-up observations are 
planned.

We thank the CARMA staff for their support in executing these observations.
