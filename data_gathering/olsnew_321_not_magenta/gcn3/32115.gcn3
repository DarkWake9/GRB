report:

The long-duration GRB 220524A
has been detected by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS),
Swift (BAT), and Mars-Odyssey (HEND),
so far, at about 35587 s UT (09:53:07).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box
whose coordinates are:
 ---------------------------------------------
  RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
 ---------------------------------------------
 Center:
   20.862 (01h 23m 27s) +46.592 (+46d 35' 30")
 Corners:
   21.916 (01h 27m 40s) +46.226 (+46d 13' 34")
   19.808 (01h 19m 14s) +47.018 (+47d 01' 03")
   19.794 (01h 19m 10s) +46.938 (+46d 56' 16")
   21.899 (01h 27m 36s) +46.146 (+46d 08' 45")
 ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 447 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 1.68 deg (the minimum one is 4.6 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 41 deg.

This box may be improved.

A triangulation map and HEALPix FITS file are posted at

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming GCN Circulars.
