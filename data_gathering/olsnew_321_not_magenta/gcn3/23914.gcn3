Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190220A (trigger #889785)
(Page et al., GCN Circ. 23908).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 330.128, -76.669 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  22h 00m 30.7s
  Dec(J2000) = -76d 40' 10.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single-pulse structure that starts
at ~T0, peaks at ~T+2 s, and ends at ~T+12 s. T90 (15-350 keV)
is 10.0 +- 2.0 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.12 to T+11.88 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 0.79 +- 0.77,
and Epeak of 40.3 +- 6.7 keV (chi squared 60.03 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.9 +- 1.0 x 10^-7 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+1.88 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
2.6 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 2.03 +- 0.13 (chi squared 70.39 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
