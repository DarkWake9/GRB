We observed the field of GRB 160624A (D'Ai et al. GCN #19560) with the
1m telescope at the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan. We obtained a 600-s
image with the SDSS r-band filter on 2016 June 24, 17:32 UT (~ 6 hours
after the burst). Apart from the possible host galaxy that is also
seen in SDSS (Cucchiara et al. GCN #19565), no new point source was
detected at the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al. GCN #19566)
with r > 22.2 mag.
