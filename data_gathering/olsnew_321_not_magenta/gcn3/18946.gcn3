Qing (Geneva Observatory) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 160127A (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 18938) 
using the LCOGT-1m located at the Sutherland, South Africa. Observations 
started at 01:14:53 UT on 2016-01-28 (i.e., 16.53 hr after the burst) 
and a series of 120s Sloan r-band frames were obtained.

The previously reported afterglow (Amaral-Rogers et al., GCN 18938; 
Klotz et al., GCN 18939; Cucchiara et al., GCN 18941) is not detected in 
our stacked image, down to a limiting magnitude of m(r) ~20.5, 
calibrated with the SDSS field.
