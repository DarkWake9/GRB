I.A. Smith (Rice U.), N.R. Tanvir (U. of Leicester) report:

We observed the location of the short GRB 150423A (Pagani et al.,
GCN Circ. 17728) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera
on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at
07:21 UT on 2015-04-23, corresponding to 53 minutes after the burst
trigger.  Exposures totaling 2.0 hours were made in good weather
conditions.  No source was detected, with the RMS background noise
being 1.5 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 17.4 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Callie Matulonis, Angus Mok, and Iain Coulson for the
prompt support of these observations that were taken under project
M15AI86.
