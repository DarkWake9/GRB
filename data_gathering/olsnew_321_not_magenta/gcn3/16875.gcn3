Two MASTER II twin  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru)  located in  Blagoveschensk  and Kislovodsk was 
pointed to the  GRB140930B (Pasquale et. al GCN 16857) 21 and 36 sec after
notice time and  39 and 54 sec after trigger time respectively.

So we have 4 first images in four different polarization started after 21 
sec (Blagoveschensk) and 36 sec (Kislovodsk) with 10 sec exposure.
We found 3-sigma OT    on one  tube image in Blagoveschensk at the
WHT  position (Tanvir et. al, GCN16861, Fong et. al. GCN16863) with m = 
16+-0.5 mag. The OT seen at one first image only.
The image with OT is available at 
http://master.sai.msu.ru/static/GRB/GRB140930B_MASTER_OT.png

We do not see OT (Tanvir et. al GCN16857, Fong et. al. GCN16857) on three
tube images on single and coadd images.
The analysis strongly is complicated by presence of very bright star (USNO 
B1 1142-0005722 ~14m) close to OT position. 
The upper limits received by MASTER are given in the table below:

* possible OT

C is  our white (clear) band which is well described by a parity 0.8R+0.2B (USNO B1).

P/ and P\ is a polarization filter which are oriented at an angle 45 and 
135 degrees to RA axis respectivel. P- and P| is a polarization filter 
which are oriented at an angle 0 and 90 degrees to RA axis respectivel.
