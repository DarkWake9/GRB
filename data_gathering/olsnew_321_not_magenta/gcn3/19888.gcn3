  As reported in ATel #9425 Global MASTER Net auto-detection system 
(Lipunov et al., MASTER Global Robotic Net, Advances in Astronomy, 2010, 
30L) discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 13h 08m 45.02s -32d 32m 54.9s on 
2016-08-24.73811 UT during inspection of HESE IceCube alert (14 August 
2016, 58537957 trigger number 
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/58537957_128340.amon , Dornic et al. 
ATEL #9440 ).

MASTER-SAAO auto-detection system detected again OT at RA (2000) = 13 08 
45.02 -32 32 54.9 on 2016-09-04.7627UT (ATEL #9425). We see OT in 
unfiltered W and I band at coadded image with total exposure 3240 s (18 x 
180 s) with 3 - sigma SNR and magnitude W=20.1+-0.3; I = 18.9 +- 0.3. The 
exposure start time is 2016-09-04 17:19:07, mead time is 2016-09-04 
17:50:11.9. So the OT slightly decay.

We remember that Integral reports about upper limit prompt Gamma-Ray 
emission (V. Savchenko et al., Atel #9391 ).

After recent discovery white dwarf AR Sco as radiopulsar (T.R. Marsh 
et.al.,2016, "A pulsing, radio emitting white dwarf". Nature 
doi:10.1038/nature18620,16 (2016)) which confirm very old idea about White 
Dwarf Ejector stage (Lipunov,V.M., Ecology of Rotators,1987, Astrophysics 
and Space Science, vol. 132, no. 1, April 1987, p. 1-51. 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987Ap%26SS.132....1L ; Lipunov, V. Nazin, 
S.N., "Recycled" white dwarfs?", Astronomical and Astrophysical 
Transactions, 1, 153-157, 1992 
http://images.astronet.ru/pubd/2008/09/29/0001231058/153-157.pdf )

The relative number of the ejecting WD is very high ( Lipunov, V. M.; 
Postnov, K. A. "The joint evolution of normal and compact magnetized stars 
in close binaries - Analytical description and statistical simulation", 
Astrophys. and Space Sci. 145, 1-45. 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988Ap%26SS.145....1L ). But radiopulsar 
phenomena need several special condition and so not discovered before this 
August.

The AR Scorpii was classified in the early 1970s as a delta-Scuti star 
(Satyvaldiev, V. "On seventeen variable stars". Astron. Tsirk. 633, 7...8 
(1971) ).

In this telegram we stress that discovery of possible CV or variable star 
inside or near 1 sigma IceCube error box is very important and this source 
extremely need new observations. The high energy neutrino can be created 
after collision pulsars relativistic jet with optical companion and high 
energy neutrino created.

We predict next properties of binaries - possible source of the high 
energy neutrino:

1. The binary orbit must be "edge on" 
and WD spin axis must be close to orbital plane. We predict eclipse in 
such systems as the test of possible high energy neutrino source.

2. The EWD (Ejecting White Dwarf) can be terminally in repeating  stage of 
close binary system, because variation optical companion can lead  to 
change accretion rates. WD  in mean is near  spin
equalibrium  and sometime have transition through Accretor, Propeller, 
Ejector stages due to change in optical companion mass loss:

                            A  ->  P  ->  E ->  P ->  A

3. So, some CV   can be some time 
produce high energy neutrino.


4. WD must be invisible and may be it hard detected during neutrino 
production moment. The OT would be appear after long time. This may 
explane why we did not see OT after neutrino detection.
