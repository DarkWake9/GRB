H. Swan (U Mich), I. Smith (Rice), C. Akerlof (U Mich), and M.
Skinner (Boeing) report on behalf of the MARGE collaboration:

The AEOS Burst Camera (ABC) on the AEOS telescope, located at the Maui 
Space Surveillance System on Haleakala, observed the field of GRB071011 
(Swift trigger 293924 (F. E. Marshall et al, GCN 6882)). The images are 
unfiltered 10s exposures which started ~6 minutes after the trigger and 
ended ~ 1 hour later.  We see the OT candidate observed by Perley et al 
(GCN 6883), but it does not fade (between 6-60 minutes).

The first image which contains the XRT position (B. Sbarufatti et al, 
GCN 6891) occurred at 20 minutes after the Swift trigger.  We coadded 
the ABC images into sets of 10 and observe three distinct closely spaced 
stellar objects within 7 arc-seconds of the XRT coordinates given in GCN 
6891. These appear to be consistent with a set of unresolved stars in 
the DSS plates (second epoch) suggesting that no new sources have been 
found within the 3-sigma XRT error circle.
