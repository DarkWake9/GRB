report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 060413 (Pagani et al., GCN4957) with the 
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). Observations 
were performed in the near infrared (J, H, K, z bands) starting on 2006 
Apr 14th at 07:58:12.5 UT and ending at 08:38:34.3 UT (approximately 13
hours after the burst). Observations in each filter lasted 300 s. Inside 
the XRT error circle (Pagani et al., GCN4959), we find a single source, 
which is visible also in the 2MASS survey. Its magnitudes are consistent 
with the 2MASS values.

The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes are:
K=14.7
H=15.2
