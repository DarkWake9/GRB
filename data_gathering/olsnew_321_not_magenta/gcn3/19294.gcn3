W. Fong (University of Arizona) reports:

"We observed the field of the short-duration GRB 160408A (Evans et al., GCN
19260) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2016 Apr
8.889 UT (14.91 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 6.0 GHz. In 1 hour of
observations, we do not detect any radio source within or around the
enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 19261) or the optical afterglow
position (Levan et al., GCNs 19262, 19269) to a 3-sigma limit of 21.5
microJy. We therefore place a 3-sigma limit of 21.5 microJy on the radio
afterglow of GRB 160408A at 14.91 hr after the burst.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
