We observed the Northern probability maximum with BETA - the ASKAP
engineering test array. The observations cover a 9.5 x 9.5 degree square
centered on 08h52m16s +06d32m00s with 8 pointings, each comprising 9
beams. We observed at center frequency of 863.5 MHz with a a bandwidth
of 300 MHz. Observing began at 2015-09-21 20:40 UT and continued for 9
hrs. We expect a spatial resolution of around 165x45 arcseconds, and a
detection limit of around 3 mJy.

Progress on downloading, checking and processing these data has been
slowed by scheduled maintenance at our primary computing facility. We
will report on the result in the next few days.
