"At 04:20:09.17 UT on 02 December 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 121202A (trigger 376114812 / 121202181)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Oates et al. 2012, GCN 14032)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 62 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single weak pulse
with a duration (T90) of 17.7 +/- 1.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.1 s to T0+17.4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.14 (+0.19/-0.17) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 135.4 (+23.6/-23.0) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.0 +/- 0.2)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-5.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.0 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
