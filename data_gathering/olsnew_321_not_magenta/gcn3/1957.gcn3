W. M. Wood-Vasey, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using images
obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks, and K. Lawrence
(Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory),
reports historical upper limits for the optical transient for GRB
20030323 of Gilmore et. al (GCN #1949) from images taken with the
Palomar Oschin 1.2-m telescope during the previous year:
