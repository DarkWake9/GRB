TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  746
SUBJECT: GRB000630, Revised BVRI Field Photometry
DATE:    00/07/03 22:03:38 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired a second night of BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field that covers the northern 60 percent of the
error box for GRB000630 with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope.
We have placed the revised photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb000630.dat
The current photometry has a potential external zero-point
error of less than two percent.  The astrometry in this file
is based on linear plate solutions with respect to USNO-A2.0.
The internal errors are less than 100mas.

In particular, the position/magnitudes of the two stars
mentioned in Halpern, et al. (GCN 745) have the revised values of:

    Star       RA(2000)    Dec(2000)        R        I
