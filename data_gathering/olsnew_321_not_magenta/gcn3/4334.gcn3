SUBJECT: GRB051211b: P60 Observations

S. B. Cenko, A. M. Soderberg (Caltech), and D. B. Fox (Penn State) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of the Integral GRB051211b (Mereghetti et al.,
GCN 4327) with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations
consisted of one 120 s exposure in the Kron R and one 120 s exposure in i'
at approximately 12 December 03:20 UT (5.2 hours after the burst).
Further observations were precluded by inclement weather.

By comparison with the Second Digital Sky Survey, we find no new sources
in the Integral error circle to the 3-sigma limits R > 19.0, I > 18.0
(calculated with respect to USNOB R2 and I2 magnitudes).  In particular,
we find no objects inside the XRT error circle (Pagani et al., GCN 4332)
or associated with the possible TAROT afterglow (Klotz et al., GCN 4329)
to the same limits.
