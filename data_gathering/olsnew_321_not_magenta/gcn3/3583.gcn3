Anderson (Washington), J. Dembicky (APO), J. Barentine (APO), R. McMillan
(APO), B. Ketzeback (APO), and D. Reichart (North Carolina) report on
behalf of the ARC GRB team of the FUN GRB collaboration:

We began observations of the localization of GRB 050713 (Falcone et al.,
GCN 3525) with NIC-FPS on the 3.5m ARC at APO beginning 53 min after the
burst.  We detect all three of the candidates identified by Malesani et al.
(GCN 3582) in J,H,Ks in 80-sec integrations, and identify their first
candidate as fading.

NIC-FPS is currently in its commissioning phase.
