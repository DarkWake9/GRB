SUBJECT: Trigger_21473: Tiled Swift observations

P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has initiated a series of observations, tiled on the sky, of the
HAWC Trigger_21473. Automated analysis of the XRT data will
be presented online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00102

Any uncatalogued X-ray sources detected in this analysis will be
reported on this website and via GCN COUNTERPART notices. The probability of finding
serendipitous sources, unrelated to the HAWC event is high: any X-ray source
considered to be a probable afterglow candidate will be reported via a GCN Circular
after manual consideration.

Details of the XRT automated analysis methods are detailed in Evans et
al. (2007, A&A, 469, 379; 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177 and 2014, ApJS, 210, 8).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
