TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1552
SUBJECT: GRB020924 (ecliptic latitude-only localization)
DATE:    02/09/25 15:47:15 GMT
FROM:    Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams, and

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, report:

Konus observed this burst at 18612 s.  Based on a preliminary analysis,
it appears to have originated from a region with ecliptic latitude
between -20 and -90 degrees, and is a short (duration 0.1 s)/hard GRB.
It was not observed by Mars Odyssey and, from the data presently
available, it does not appear to have been detected by Ulysses, so a
small error box cannot be determined for it.  If the location of this
event can be constrained further, a subsequent GCN will be issued.  The
Konus team should be contacted for further details about this event.
