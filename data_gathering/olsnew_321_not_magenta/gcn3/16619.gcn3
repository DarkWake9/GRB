R. L. C. Starling (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift slewed to GRB 140719B (trigger=605700, Starling et al. GCN Circ. 16609) on 2014-07-21,
delayed due to a moon constraint.
Observations with the XRT began at 07:59:24UT and comprised a total of 6.87 ks in photon counting
mode spanning 126.6 - 140.1 ks after the BAT trigger. We do not detect any X-ray sources within the
BAT refined error circle (Barthelmy et al. GCN Circ. 16615), and place a 3-sigma upper limit on the
count rate at the BAT position of 0.003 count s^-1.

This  circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
