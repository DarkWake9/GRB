Guy Pooley, on behalf of the AMI collaboration (Cavendish Astrophysics, 
University of Cambridge) reports:

We detected GRB 090313 in an observation with the
AMI Large Array in the frequency range 14.5 to 17.5 GHz.

The observation was on 2009 Mar 16 from 02h00m to 04h24m (2d 18h after the 
burst: Mao et al, GCN 8980). We measured a flux density of 820 microJy with 
an rms noise of 71 microJy, at a position 13h13m36.0s +08d05'47", 
consistent with the optical position (Chornock et al GCN8979). 
The resolution is 63"x24" at p.a. 24deg.
