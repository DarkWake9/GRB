report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 201128B (James DeLaunay et al. GCN Circ.
28971), collecting 5.0 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between
T0+246.0 ks and T0+303.8 ks. 

Ten uncatalogued X-ray sources have been detected, however none of them
is above the RASS limit or shows definitive signs of fading. Therefore,
at the present time we cannot identify which, if any, is the afterglow.
Details of these sources are given below:
