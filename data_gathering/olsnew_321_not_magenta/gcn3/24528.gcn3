In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190513bm at T0 = 2019-05-13 20:54:28 (UT)
(GCN #24522), we performed an analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector
(GRID) data.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed over
the time interval (T0 - 100s; T0), where an exposure of about 40% of the S190513bm
90% c.l. localization region was available.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limits (UL) are obtained:

from 5.0e-08 to 5.0e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the sky
in spinning mode. Additional AGILE GRID data analysis is in progress.
