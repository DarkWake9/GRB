" We observed the central 50 x 50 arcmin of the error region of GRB
021204 (HETE trigger 2486; GRB time 13:14:46.11 UT) with the 105-cm
Schmidt telescope at the Kiso observatory, the University of
Tokyo. Starting at 2002 December 4.812 UT, 300-s exposures were made
in B, V, R, I band.  Comparison with the DPOSS image did not show an
optical afterglow candidate brighter than 18.7R mag."
