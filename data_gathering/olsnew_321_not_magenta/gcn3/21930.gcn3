Marshall (GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-IceCube collaboration:

Swift has observed the field of the IceCube EHE event, IceCube-170922A
(revision 0, https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/50579430_130033.amon),
utilizing the on-board 19-point tiling pattern to cover a region
centred on RA,Dec (J2000) = (77.2866d, +5.7537d), with a radius of
approximately 0.8 degrees. Swift-XRT collected ~800 s per field of PC
mode data per tile. The observations were taken between 00:09:16 UT
and 22:42:08 UT on 2017 September 23 (i.e. from 11.7 ks to 92.9 ks
after the neutrino trigger), and covered 2.1 square degrees.

Nine X-ray sources are detected in the observations. Eight of these
correspond to known X-ray emitters. One object (Source 6) is not
catalogued in X-rays, however it lies 5.7" from PMN J0511+0538 which
is a radio source. The X-ray source position is RA,Dec (J2000) =
(77.8658d, +5.6420d) which is equivalent to:

RA = 05h 11m 27.80s
Dec = +05d 38' 31.2"

with an uncertainty of 7.1" [90% confidence radius]. The mean XRT
count rate is 6.9 (+3.7, -2.8) e-3 ct s^-1. More XRT follow-up
observations have been requested.

The 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate in the rest of the field is
0.0093 ct s^-1, which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.8e-13 erg
cm^-2 s^-1 for a typical AGN spectrum (NH=3e20 cm^-2, Gamma=1.7).
Overlaps between the different tiles account for 0.5 square degrees:
in these regions the 3-sigma upper limit is 0.0057 ct s^-1,
corresponding to 2.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
