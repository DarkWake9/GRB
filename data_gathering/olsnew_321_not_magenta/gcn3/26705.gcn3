The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:11:08 UT on 11 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200111A (trigger 600448273.105796 / 200111633).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 104.5, Dec = 31.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 06h 58m, 31d 41'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86.0 degrees.
