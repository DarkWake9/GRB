The long-duration, soft spectrum GRB 140529A (Cummings, GCN 16340)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=34086.312 s UT (09:28:06.312).
The burst light curve shows a single peak with a total duration of ~3 s.
The emission is seen up to ~1 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of 
2.6(-0.3,+0.3)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.248 s, of 1.7(-0.4,+0.4)x10^-6 
erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with  alpha = -1.50(-0.45,+0.54),
and Ep = 52(-31,+17) keV, chi2 = 66/50 dof.
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -2.92 (chi2 = 
66/49 dof).
