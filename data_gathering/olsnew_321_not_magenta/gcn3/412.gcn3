K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, Scott Barthelmy,
on behalf of the GCN team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the NEAR
GRB team, report:

NEAR observed BATSE trigger #7766, leading to a preliminary error
box (as opposed to just the annulus reported in GCN 410) for this 
burst, whose corners are at:

RA(2000)		Decl.(2000)
 07 h 35 m 05 s      74o  39' 40"
 07 h 05 m 51 s      72o  31' 43"
 07 h 19 m 06 s      73o  47' 57"
 06 h 48 m 19 s      71o  02' 41"

This error box is located roughly between the COMPTEL and LOCBURST
positions.  A map may be found at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/990915/.  This
error box will be refined considerably when the final data become
available.
