E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"Beginning on February 15.41 UT we observed the entire BeppoSAX refined 
WFC error circle of GRB010214 (GCN#933) with the VLA at 4.86 and 8.46 
GHz.  We find no new sources with a flux density level larger than 310 
and 210 microJy, respectively (5 sigma).  A limit of 160 and 130 microJy,
respectively can be placed on the absence of a radio source at the 
position of the possible IR transient (GCN#939)."
