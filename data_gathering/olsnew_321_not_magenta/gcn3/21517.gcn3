and C. Ferrigno, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

A short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 170816A was detected by
by Fermi (GBM; Roberts et al., GCN 21504), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL
(SPI-ACS), and Swift (BAT), so far, at about 51784 s UT (14:23:04).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose 
coordinates are:
---------------------------------------------
   RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
  ---------------------------------------------
  Center:
   350.841 (23h 23m 22s) +12.853 (+12d 51' 11")
  Corners:
   349.856 (23h 19m 25s) +13.372 (+13d 22' 19")
   352.036 (23h 28m 09s) +12.535 (+12d 32' 07")
   351.782 (23h 27m 08s) +12.294 (+12d 17' 38")
   349.591 (23h 18m 22s) +13.118 (+13d 07' 06")
  ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2650 sq. arcmin, and its maximum
dimension is 2.45 deg (the minimum one is 19 arcmin).
The Sun distance was 144 deg.

This box may be improved.

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
