R. Chornock, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko report on behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory slewed to the
position of GRB 090313 and found a new bright source not present in the DSS:
Coordinates (J2000) 13:13:36.21  +08:05:49.8

The bright moon is hindering follow up, but the source appears to be mag ~16 and
 is a few arcseconds away from a galaxy.
