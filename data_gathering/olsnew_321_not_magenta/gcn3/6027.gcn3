At 02:33:26 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible source (trigger=257741).  Swift slewed immediately 
to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 33.460, -73.523 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 13m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = -73d 31' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows no significant variation,
which is not uncommon for image triggers. We will have to wait for ground
analysis to determine if this is a real source. 

The XRT began observing the field at 02:35:21 UT, 116 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT centroided on a cosmic ray and no source is visible in 
the field of view up to an exposure time of 203s. 

The UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 123 seconds after the BAT trigger. The
quickly available image does not cover any portion of the BAT error
circle.
