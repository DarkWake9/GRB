W. M. Wood-Vasey, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using images
obtained by R. Bambery, S. Pravdo, M. Hicks, and K. Lawrence
(Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory),
reports historical upper limits for the optical transient for 
GRB 030418 of Price et. al (GCN #2148) from images taken with the
Haleakala MSSS 1.2-m and Palomar Oschin 1.2-m telescopes from 
2001 Apr 19 -- 2003 Mar 28.

A co-addition of these images (Haleakala: 2001 Apr 19, May 7, 2002 Jan
8, Jan 14, Feb 4; Palomar: 2002 Feb 7, Feb 17, Mar 9, Apr 8, Apr 19,
May 11, 2003 Mar 28) shows nothing at this location to a combined
limiting magnitude of 22.81 (S/N = 3).
