Using the data set from T-239 to T+303 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080218A (trigger #303609)
(Ziaeepour, et al., GCN Circ. 7313).  The BAT ground-calculated position is 
RA, Dec = 355.941, 12.159 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 43m 45.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = 12d 9' 34" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 21%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows three peaks at T-12 sec, T+0 sec, 
and T+9 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 27.6 +- 5.9 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.8 to T+18.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.34 +- 0.35.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.3 +- 1.4 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
