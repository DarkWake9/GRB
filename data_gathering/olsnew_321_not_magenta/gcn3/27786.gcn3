SUBJECT: GRB 200522A: 6 GHz VLA radio source detection

FROM:    Wen-fai Fong at Northwestern U  <wfong@northwestern.edu>

G. Schroeder, W. Fong, and K. D. Alexander (Northwestern) report:

"We observed the position of GRB 200522A (Evans et al., GCN 27778; Beardmore et al., GCN 27780) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2020 May 22.709 UT (5.33 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 6 GHz.

We detect a faint radio source with a significance of ~4-sigma at the position:

RA(J2000) = 00:22:43.72
Dec(J2000) = -00:16:57.9

with an uncertainty of ~1" in each coordinate. This position is consistent with the putative host galaxy (Fong et al., GCN 27779), and toward the outskirts of the updated XRT position. Further observations are planned to understand the nature of this source and whether it is the radio afterglow or emission from the host galaxy.

We thank the VLA staff immensely for quickly approving and executing these observations."
