SUBJECT: GRB 130418A: WSRT radio observation
DATE:    13/04/22 06:50:13 GMT
FROM:    Alexander van der Horst at U of Amsterdam  <A.J.vanderHorst@uva.nl>

A.J. van der Horst (University of Amsterdam) reports on behalf
of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 130418A afterglow at 4.9 GHz with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at April 21 13.53 UT to
April 22 01.49 UT, i.e. 2.77 - 3.27 days after the burst (GCN 14377).
We do not detect a radio source at the position of the optical
counterpart (GCN 14384). The three-sigma rms noise in the map around
that position is 69 microJy per beam. The formal flux measurement for
a point source at the position of the optical counterpart is 34 +/- 23 
microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for quickly scheduling and
obtaining these observations."
