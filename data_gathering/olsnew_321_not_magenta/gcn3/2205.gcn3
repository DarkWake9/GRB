K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS) observed this burst at 27539 s.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   40 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  2.2E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  4.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 152.204, 37.050 degrees, whose radius is 77.910 +/-  0.133
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but as the event was
not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be derived for
it.
