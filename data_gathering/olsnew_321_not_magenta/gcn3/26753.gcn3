SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo S200114f: Candidates from SAGUARO observations

Michael J. Lundquist, David J. Sand (UA), Jillian Rastinejad, Kerry
Paterson (Northwestern), Jennifer Andrews (UA), Wen-fai Fong,
(Northwestern), Sam Wyatt, Eric Christensen, Alex Gibbs, Frank Shelly (UA),
report on behalf of the SAGUARO collaboration:

We initiated observations of 36 fields (each 5 deg^2, totalling 180 deg^2)
within the LVC localization region for the GW trigger S200114f (LVC Circ
26734) starting on 2020-01-14 at 4:15 UT (2.12 hours after the GW trigger)
with the 1.5m Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ.  The
typical limiting magnitudes of single pointings are G~21 mag (calibrated to
Gaia DR2).

We have posted our pointings to the Treasure Map, and encourage others to
do the same:

We perform real-time processing and image subtraction (described in
Lundquist et al. 2019, ApJL, 881, 2). After discarding known moving
objects, stellar sources and known transients (cross-correlating with the
Transient Name Server and the ZTF alert stream), we find no strong
candidates that we believe to be associated with the GW event with S/N>5.
Due to the uncertain nature of the GW event however, we report 5
additional, less likely candidates below for completeness. These are
possibly variable stars or AGN. All magnitudes are based on our difference
imaging and have been calibrated to Gaia G band.
