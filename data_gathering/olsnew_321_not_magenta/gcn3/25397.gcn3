We reobserved the fields listed in GCN  25374 using the Large Monolithic
Imager (LMI) on the 4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) at Happy Jack,
AZ. Observations started on August 18, 10:09:02 UTC (about 3.54 days after
the detection) with SDSS i filter.

We do not find any obvious transient source down to i~21 AB mag for objects
within the galaxy, and i~22 AB mag for field objects.

We also observed the DECam-GROWTH candidates DG19qabkc and DG19wgmjc
(Andreoni et al., GCN Circ. 25362; Goldstein et al., GCN Circ. 25391) in i
and z band.

Both objects are detected with i~21 AB mag, although photometric
measurements are contaminated by host galaxy light.

We thank the staff of the Discovery Channel Telescope in particular Ana
Hayslip for assistance with these observations.
