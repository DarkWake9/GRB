MASTER Global Robotic Net (http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010,Advances in Astronomy,v. 2010, 30L)
observed IceCube-HAWC 200202A (error-bx AMON GCN 26963)  since 2020-02-02 
21:50:53 UT.o

MASTER-Amur robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Blagoveshchensk State Pedagogical 
University) was pointed to the IceCube Alert 200202.33 (trigger No 
20200202075852,13h 21m 12.00s , +12d 42m 36.0s, R=0.3) errorbox  49921 sec 
after trigger time at 2020-02-02 21:50:53 UT, with upper limit up to  17.2 
mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith 
distance = 44 deg. The sun  altitude  is -11.8 deg.

MASTER-Tunka robotic telescope  located in Russia (Applied Physics 
Institute, Irkutsk State University) was pointed to the IceCube Alert 
200202.33 errorbox  50850 sec after trigger time at 2020-02-02 22:06:22 
UT, with upper limit up to  18.2 mag.
The observations began at zenith distance = 39 deg., sun altitude  was -24.6 deg.

MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  located in South Africa (South African 
Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the IceCube Alert 200202.33 
errorbox  53716 sec after trigger time at 2020-02-02 22:54:08 UT, with 
upper limit up to  20.4 mag.
The observations began at zenith distance = 76 deg., sun altitude  was -41.2 deg.

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was 
pointed to the IceCube Alert 200202.33 errorbox  59842 sec after trigger 
time at 2020-02-03 00:36:14 UT, with upper limit up to  21.5 mag.
The observations began at zenith distance = 69 deg.,sun altitude was -75.5 deg.
The error-box galactic latitude b = 73 deg., longitude l = 332 deg.

Auto-detection system marginally found 
possible OT in SDSS J132141.10+125747.3 with m  ~ 19.6 
(host galaxy photom.z~0.47749).
But hand analysis do not strong supply this 
resuts.

There is QSO SDSS_J13210+1237 in error-box,
but it didn't change the brightness

Reduction and analysys of galaxy clusters inside error-box will be continued.
