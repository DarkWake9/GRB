SUBJECT: GRB 190114C: Sardinia Radio Telescope observations (CORRECTION)
DATE:    19/01/18 11:38:45 GMT
FROM:    Marco Marongiu at Ferrara U  <marco.marongiu@unife.it>

M. Marongiu (U. Ferrara), on behalf of our collaboration, report:

We noticed a typo in our GCN Circular 23753 (Marongiu et al.), reporting 
SRT observations.
The correct date is Jan 17 (2.8-3.1 days after the burst) instead of 18 
as reported.

We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.
