report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:11:30.57 UT on 06 April 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 210406A (trigger 639421895 / 210406716),
which was also detected by the INTEGRAL/ISGRI (Mereghetti et al. 2021, GCN 29767).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 154 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a long GRB with multiple spikes and
with a duration (T90) of about 17.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.0 s to T0+18.4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.91 +/- 0.13 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 195.6 +/- 18.8 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.1 +/- 0.5)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.6 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
