J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA),
K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL), T. Sakamoto (AGU) and
M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 06:16:29 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a source near the galactic center (trigger=547142).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 268.413, -25.762 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 53m 39s
   Dec(J2000) = -25d 45' 41"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for a long image trigger, the 
rapidly available BAT light curve shows no significant
structure. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 04:38 UT on 2013 February 04. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

The position of this source, 3.6 degrees from the Galactic center
and 0.1 degrees from the Galactic plane, as well as its duration
(>20 minutes in the discovery image) strongly implies that this is
Galactic transient. 

We shall assign a name for this source after ground analysis produces
a refined position. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. R. Cummings (jayc AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
