Using the data set from T-239 to T+395 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120119A (trigger #512035)
(Beardmore, et al., GCN Circ. 12859).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 120.029, -9.076 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  08h 00m 06.9s
    Dec(J2000) = -09d 04' 35.3"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a series of three overlapping peaks running
from T-10 sec to T+220 sec, with the bulk of emission before T+60 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 253.8 +- 24.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
Swift started to enter the South Atlantic Anomaly at T+ ~200 sec and collection of
event data was terminated at T+395 sec.

The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.2 to T+361.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.38 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.0 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+9.21 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 10.3 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
