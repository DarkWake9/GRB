Johan P. U. Fynbo (DARK) report:

Unfortunately I made an error in the gain-correction in the photometry
reported in GCN #5817. Here are the correct numbers for the revised
photometry. In the NOT images taken about 8 hr after the GRB) we measure
R=22.5. In the VLT image taken about 14 hr after the GRB we measure
R=23.1. Here we assume R=21.3 for the star at RA(2000) = 22:25:07.760,
Dec(2000) = -02:15:00.52. I apologize for the confusion.
