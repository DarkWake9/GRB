"At 12:54:27.00 UT on 2 February 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located a burst from SGR J1935+2154 (trigger 633963272/210202538).
The same burst was also reported by INTEGRAL (Ricciarini et al. 2021, GCN 29383).

The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the known position of the SGR.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 90 degrees.

The burst has a duration (T90) of about 0.1 seconds
in the energy range 10-200 keV.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.048 s to T0+0.96 s is
adequately fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is 0.28 +/- 0.13 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 34.1 +/- 0.6 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.25 +/- 0.14)E-07 erg/cm^2.
The 64-ms peak photon flux measured starting from T0
in the 10-1000 keV band is 152 +/- 5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary.

GBM will continue to monitor the source and issue GCNs for bright bursts
from SGR J1935+2154 that have been observed by other instruments
with improved localizing capabilities, and for SGR bursts
initially misclassified as GRBs.
