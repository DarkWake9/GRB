S. Immler (NASA/USRA) and L. Vetere (PSU) report on the behalf
of the Swift UVOT team:

An extended source is found at the position reported by Malesani
et al. (GCN 6046) in UVOT images of GRB 070126, consistent with
the position of the XRT source (Vetere & Racusin, GCN 6045). The
source is also present in DSS images and could be the host galaxy of
the faint burst.
 
The table below gives the measured UVOT magnitudes. The position
of the burst is outside the UVOT field-of-view for all other filters.

Filter  T_start    T_end    Exposure Mag    Error
WHITE   123      6146    590         21.8   0.4
UVW1    3900    40895    3592     21.0    0.3
UVM2    5128    40337    3333     21.5    0.3
UVW2    4719     6214    2588     >20.4  (3-sigma UL)

T_start and T_end are the start and stop times of the summed
exposures in seconds from the trigger. No correction has been
made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) =
0.05 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998).
