   (Bologna Observatory) report:

    During the night between 09/03/13 and 09/03/14 we observed the OT of
    GRB090313 (Chornock et al., GCN 8979, Mao et al., GCN 8980) with the
    1.52 cm telescope of the Bologna Observatory in Loiano. Airmass 1.24
    and seeing less than 2" .
    Observations were disturbed by the moon. The images were calibrated
    using the star quoted by Guidorzi et al.,  GCN 8989.
    By summing 9 images in filter R, with a total duration of 2280s
    obtained on March 14 between 00:41:11 and 01:27:59 UT, (mid exposure
    time 15.97 hr after the burst) we find R mag = 19.26 +/- 0.15
