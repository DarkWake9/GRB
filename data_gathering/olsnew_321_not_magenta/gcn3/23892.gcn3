V. Sharma, D. Bhattacharya, T. Khanam and A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a short bright GRB 190206A, which was also detected by Konus-Wind (Kozlova A. et al., GCN # 23880).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows single pulse of emission with peak at 03:49:28.5 UT, about 4.6 s after the Konus-Wind trigger time, consistent with possible propagation delay. We do not see any activity around 03:49:19 UT, the reference time quoted by IPN  (Svinkin D. et al., GCN # 23879). The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 396 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 413 cts. The local mean background count rate was 515 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 0.94 s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
