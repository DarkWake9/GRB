S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, E. Mazets, V. Pal'shin, D. Frederiks, P.
Oleynik, M. Ulanov, D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind
team, report:

A very bright short burst triggered Konus-Wind at
2009-01-25 T0=31417.781 s UT (08:43:37.781).

The Konus-Wind light curve (strongly affected by pileup)
of this burst is available at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/SGRs/090125_T31417/
The emission is seen at least to 400 keV.

The source of the burst is in the south ecliptic hemisphere.

Retrospectively this burst resembles the famous event 980618d from
SGR 1627-41 (Mazets et al. 1999 ApJ, 519, L151): 
http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/SGR/Catalog/Data/1627/980618d.htm

Taking in account the ongoing bursting activity of
the AXP/SGR 1E1547.0-5408 we suggest the burst originated from this source.
