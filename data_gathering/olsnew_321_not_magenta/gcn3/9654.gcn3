report on behalf of a large collaboration"

The Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope observed the position of the GRB090709A 
afterglow (Morris et al. GCN 9625) at 4.9 GHz between July 10.71 and 11.26, 2009 
(i.e. about 1.67 days after the burst). No radio counterpart to the afterglow was detected
up to three sigma rms limit of 141 microJy. The formal flux measured at the position 
of the NIR counterpart (Morgan et al. GCN 9635) is 104 +/- 47 microJy.

We would like to thank the WSRT staff for rapidly scheduling and obtaining
these observations."
