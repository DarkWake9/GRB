"We report optical observations, covering ~90% of the refined 7'
error-circle (HETE#11553-2) of GRB040825A, taken with the Danish 1.54m
telescope at La Silla (FoV=13.7'), as follows:

Date midobs (UT) | t_b+  | filter:expt | seeing | 3sig limit
------------------------------------------------------------
Aug. 26.30, 2004   27.7h    R:14x600s     ~1.1"     R~23.5
Aug. 26.31, 2004   27.9h    V:12x600s     ~1.4"     V~23.3
Aug. 27.31, 2004   51.9h    R:18x600s     ~1.5"     R~23.0
Aug. 28.28, 2004   75.2h    I:13x300s     ~2.1"     I~21.0

Photometric calibration is based on Henden et al. (GCN#2668).

Visual comparison of the three main epochs reveals no candidate optical
afterglow down to R~23.0"

[GCN OPS NOTE (02Sep04 11:15 UT): The second column (t_b+) of the table
had a wrong offset in the original posting (should have been 12.8h larger).
This archived copy of the circular has the corrected t_b+ values.]
