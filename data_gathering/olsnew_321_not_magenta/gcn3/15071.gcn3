At 02:51:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130806A (trigger=565562).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 35.872, +67.530 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 23m 29s
   Dec(J2000) = +67d 31' 48"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 02:52:40.2 UT, 66.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a possible
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 35.92827, 67.53242 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 02h 23m 42.8s
   Dec(J2000) = 67d 31' 56.7"
with an uncertainty of 9.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 78 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 68 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
1.19. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B.P. Gompertz (bpg6 AT le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
