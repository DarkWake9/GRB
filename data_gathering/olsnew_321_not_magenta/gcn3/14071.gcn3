L. Elenin (KIAM),  A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (SAI MSU, IKI), V. 
Savanevych (KNURE), A. Bryukhovetskiy (NSFCTC), I. Molotov (KIAM), report on 
behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  the Swift GRB 121212A (Grupe et al., GCN   14064) 
with 0.45-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory  starting on  Dec. 12 (UT) 
06:58:31, i.e  138 s after burst trigger.  We took  several unfiltered 
images of 30 s exposures.  An automatic real-time pipeline did not detect 
any new object. However after stacking all images we marginally detected the 
source not visible in any filter of DSS2  in coordinates  11 51 10.40 +78 02 
15.3 with uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec in both coordinates. The source is 
consistent with enhanced XRT afterglow position    (Beardmore et al. GCN 
14066)  and optical transient (Kuin et al. GCN  14069;  Perley and Horesh 
GCN  14070) .   A  preliminary  photometry  of co-added frames is based  on 
the USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby  stars is following:
