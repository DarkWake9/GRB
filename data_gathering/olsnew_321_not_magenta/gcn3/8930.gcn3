Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 05:10:48.16 UT on 04 March 2009, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 090304 (trigger 257836250 / 090304.216).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is RA = 246.4, Dec = -80.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to
J2000 16h 25m, -80d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 13.1 degrees
(radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there is additionally
a systematic error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 31 degrees.

Since the source is weak, the time-averaged spectrum is poorly constrained.

This event has also been detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS."
