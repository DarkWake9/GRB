P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), M. de Pasquale (MSSL/UCL) and J. K. Cannizzo
(GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift team

Swift has performed further observations of GRB 150514A (Kocevski and
Arimoto, GCN Circ. 17816), collecting a further 2 ks of data, from
T0+120.9 ks to T0+122.9 ks. The object previously detected in the XRT
(Kennea et al. GCN Circ. 17818) and UVOT (Marshall & Cannizzo, GCN Circ.
17820) has faded in both instruments.

The UVOT counterpart was detected with a white magnitude of 20.51
+/-0.15, which gives a power-law decay index of 1.63 +/- 0.15.
The X-ray counterpart was detected with a count-rate of
(1.04 +/- 0.03) x 10^-2 ct/sec, which gives a power-law decay index of
1.4 +/- 0.5, consistent with the slope measured from the UVOT data.

This circular is an official result of the Swift team.
