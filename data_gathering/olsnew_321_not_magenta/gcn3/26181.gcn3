IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches [1,2] for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate
S191105e
 in a time range of 1000 seconds [3] centered on the alert event time
(2019-11-05 14:27:01.933 UTC to 2019-11-05 14:43:41.933 UTC) have been
performed.

During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data.
No significant track-like events are found in spatial coincidence of
S191105e calculated from the map circulated in the 2-Initial notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment
of S191105e ranges from 0.029 to 0.694 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
