report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 11:27:01.35 UT on 24 June 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160624A (trigger 488460425 / 160624477),
which was also detected by the Swift (D'Ai et al. 2016, GCN 19560)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 76
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 0.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.40 +/- 0.28 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 841 +/- 358 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.2 +/- 0.5)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.00 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.4 +/- 1.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
