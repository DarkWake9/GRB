E. Berger (Carnegie) reports:

"We observed the error circle of the INTEGRAL burst GRB 061025 (GCN 5751) 
with GMOS on the Gemini-south telescope starting on 2006 Oct. 26.004 UT 
(5.5 hr after the burst).  A total of 1470 s were obtained in i-band in 
good seeing conditions (0.6").  Within the XRT error circle (GCN 5753) we 
find a single point source with i=22.0 mag, located at (J2000):
 	RA = 20:03:37.1
 	DEC= -48:14:37.0
with an uncertainty of about 0.5" in each coordinate.  At the present we 
do not have evidence for variability, but we consider this source to be an 
afterglow candidate."
