GRB 990712 Late Optical Decay and Host Galaxy

A. Dar (Technion, Haifa and CERN), F. Courbin (Universidad Catolica de Chile)
and P. Moller (ESO) report:

"We have obtained a 4-min R-band exposure of the optical afterglow + host
galaxy of GRB 990712 (Bakos et al., GCN #387; IAUC 7225; Hjorth et al., 
GCN #389; Kemp & Halpern GCN #402) with the ESO 8.2-m Antu telescope on 
12.232 August 1999 UT. The OT + host has R = 21.71 +- 0.03 on the PLANET 
photometric system and is slightly extended in seeing FWHM = 1.2" as revealed 
by (i) faint but significant residuals after fitting and subtraction of a 
point source (ii) deconvolution (Magain et al., ApJ, 494, 452, 1998). The host 
galaxy is oriented roughly E-W. The decay slope of the optical transient 
(-1.03) and host galaxy magnitude (R = 21.76) are consistent with the 
prediction of Hjorth et al. (GCN #389) when correcting for the erroneous date 
of the first data point of Bakos et al. (IAUC 7225) and with the findings of 
Kemp & Halpern (GCN #402). The R band light curve can also be fit by a galaxy 
(R = 21.92) and an OT with initial power-law decay (-1.00) that is taken over 
later by a ``standard candle'' SN (Dar, astro-ph/9902017; Bloom et al., 
astro-ph/9905301; Dar, GCN #346; Reichart, astro-ph/9906079; Galama et al., 
astro-ph/9907264) like 1998bw (Galama et al., Nature, 395, 670, 1998; 
McKenzie & Schaefer, astro-ph/9904397) at the redshift of the GRB (z = 0.43; 
Galama et al., GCN #388). The HST observation of GRB 990712 scheduled for 
August 29 can distinguish between the two models which predict OT magnitudes 
of R = 25.80 in the simple power-law model and R = 24.20 in the power law + SN 
model (or R(SN) = 24.58 if the power law decline steepened before August 29). 
The takeover by a SN light curve would also result in a dramatic reddening of 
the afterglow colours. Alternatively, the two models can be discriminated by 
high-precision R band observations obtained around 1 August 1999 UT or by
late-time observations of the host galaxy brightness. The VLT image (before and 
after point source subtraction or deconvolution) and the R-band light curves 
for the two models are posted at http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jens/grb990712/ ."
