Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080607 (trigger #313417)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 7847).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 194.964, 15.910 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 59m 51.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 54' 37.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 11%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks.  The first starts at ~T-5 sec.
The main cluster of overlapping peaks starts at ~T-1 sec, with the brightest
peak at T+2.0 sec, and ending at ~T+10 sec.  Following that is a series 
of weak peaks out to ~T+180 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 79 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.9 to T+154.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.31 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.0 x 10^-05 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.50 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 23.1 +- 1.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
