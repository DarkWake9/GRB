   We observed GRB090530 (Cannizzo et al. GCN 9438) in R using
  the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lemmon (Arizona, US) operated by
  the Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute.
   The R-band imaging started at 2009 May 30, 04:18:02 UT
  (~1 hr after the burst), with the mid-point at May 30,
  04:45 UT.

   In a stacked image of 9 frames (3 min exp. each),
  the optical afterglow is clearly detected
  at R=19.6 +- 0.15 mag.
   The photometry was calibrated against R2mag of USNO-B1 stars
  in the vicinity of GRB.

   We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for his assistance for this
  observation.
