report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:39:26.21 UT on 02 February 2019, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 190202A (trigger 570764371 / 190202069) which was
also detected by the Swift/BAT (Lien et al., GCN 23830). The GBM on-ground
location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 76
degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a dominant pulse with some structure
with a duration (T90) of about 18.4 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.4 s to T0+12.8 s is
best fit by a  Band function with Epeak = 287 +/- 18 keV,
alpha = -0.74 +/- 0.04, and beta = -2.22 +/- 0.12.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.81 +/- 0.03)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 13.6 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
