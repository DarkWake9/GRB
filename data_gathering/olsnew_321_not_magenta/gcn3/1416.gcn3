Hastings report:

We have observed the field of GRB020531 (=H2042) (Ricker et al., GCN
1399) using the SPIcam (4.78' x 4.78' field of view) on the ARC
3.5-meter telescope at APO under clear skies and a bright moon on UTC
2002 June 1 from 07:27:53 to 07:43:05 UTC (beginning 1.3 days after the
burst), and under mostly clear skies but poor seeing on UTC 2002 June 6
from 04:38:33 to 04:54:22 UTC (beginning 7.2 days after the burst).

On both nights we took three 400-second r'-band exposures that cover
the entire refined hexagonal IPN error region for GRB020531 (Hurley et
al., GCN 1407).  We have examined these images in the vicinity of the
ten X-ray sources seen in the first Chandra follow-up observation that
lie inside the refined IPN error region and the three bright X-ray
sources that lie just outside the refined IPN error region (Ricker et
al., GCN 1415).  The table below lists the approximate r* magnitude or
the approximate limiting r* magnitude of any object that lies at the
location of these thirteen X-ray sources, based on a preliminary
analysis of a single r'-band image taken on each night.  SPIcam RMS
astrometric errors are 0.2 arcsec or less.
