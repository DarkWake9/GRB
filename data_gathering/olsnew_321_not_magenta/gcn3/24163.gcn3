SUBJECT: GRB 190424A: Swift detection of a burst

J.D. Gropp (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 10:00:43 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190424A (trigger=900285).  Swift did not slew to the burst
due to an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 48.681, +20.233 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 14m 43s
   Dec(J2000) = +20d 14' 00"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single FRED peak
structure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 17:34 UT on 2019 June 30. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J.D. Gropp (jdg44 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
