We observed the field of GRB 211211A detected by Fermi (Fermi GBM team, 
GCN 31201) and Swift (D'Ai et al., GCN 31202) using the NEXT-0.6m 
optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations 
started at 23:01:09 UT on 2021-12-11, i.e., 9.85 hr after the BAT 
trigger, and 10x200 s frames in the Sloan r-filter as well as 12x200 s 
frames in the Sloan z-filter were obtained.

The optical afterglow candidate of the GRB reported by KAIT (Zheng & 
Filippenko, GCN 31203), consistent with the enhanced Swift-XRT position 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 31205), is detected in our stacked r- and z-band 
images. Preliminary photometry is as follows:

T_mid-T0 (hr)    Mag     MagErr  Filter
10.34               20.29    0.07        r
10.68               19.9      0.3         z

both calibrated with nearby PS1 stars.

We note that the NEXT's r-band magnitude is comparable to that of KAIT 
in the clear band, although the time interval of the two observations is 
~10 hr.
