TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3304
SUBJECT: GRB 050421: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    05/04/21 15:24:42 GMT
FROM:    Eli Rykoff at U of Michigan/ROTSE  <erykoff@umich.edu>

E.S. Rykoff (U Mich), S.A. Yost (U Mich), H. Swan (U Mich) report on 
behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 
050421 (Swift trigger 115135), producing images beginning 9.7 s after 
the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image at 
04:12:58.8 UT, 67.2 s after the burst, under good conditions. These 
observations were affected by the bright moon. We took 10 5-sec, and 350 
20-sec eposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO 
A2.0 (R).

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the 
3-sigma BAT error circle including the 3-sigma XRT error circle (GCN 
3301). Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 
16.49-17.34. In particular, we set a limit of magnitude 16.49 in a 
single 5 s exposure, starting 67.1 s after the burst. Coadding images 
into sets of 10 reveals no new sources down to limits of 17.8 (t0+61.7s 
- t0+130.7s) and 18.4 (t0+144s - t0+431s)
