G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 


"At 13:14:16.70 UT on 18th March 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110318 (trigger 322146858 / 110318552), 
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Sbarufatti et al. 2011, 
GCN 11798). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift 
position.


The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 70 degrees.


The GBM light curve consists of single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 12 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1 s to T0+10 s is  
fit well with  a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.86 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 114.70 +/- 3.72 keV


A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak= 107.00 +/- 5.18
keV, alpha =-0.80 +/- 0.05, and beta = -2.74 +/- 0.25.


The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(8.05 +/- 0.15)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0-1 s in the 8-1000 keV band 
is 10.97 +/- 0.29 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
