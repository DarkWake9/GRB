D. Roberts, M.Morrell & U. Kolb (The Open University) reporting on behalf of the PIRATE group:

We observed 4 separate fields of the G274296 cWB skymap using our 0.43m robotic telescope at Teide Observatory, Tenerife, Spain. We acquired 96 images across the first night of observation, with a further 24 images taken 2 days later, all images were obtained using the R filter and 100s exposure length. Initial observations began at 2017-02-17T23:39:33, approximately 35 minutes after the initial GCN alert was received. A list of the 4 fields observed is given below, each with FoV of 0.7x0.7 degrees centred around the given coordinates. Analysis is ongoing.

Field      RA          Dec
#1:          150.0     20.0
#2:          157.5     25.0
