Following the detection of GRB 050701 by Swift/BAT (Boyd et al, GCN
3356), we obtained unfiltered images starting 14.7 hours after the
trigger, using one of Tenagra observatory's 0.35-m telescopes at Perth,
Western Australia.  No new source was detected within the 6"  radius XRT
error circle (Hurkett et al., GCN 3560) down to the DSS-2 limiting
magnitude.
