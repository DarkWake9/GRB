SUBJECT: GRB 170101A: Swift detection of a burst

A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space),
B. Mingo (U Leicester), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 02:26:01 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170101A (trigger=729293). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 267.103, +11.654 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 48m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = +11d 39' 15"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~28000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 23:58 UT on 2017 January 19. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

The Swift team wishes the astronomical community a happy 2017. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Y. Lien (amy.y.lien AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
