At 01:22:57 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080409 (trigger=308812).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 84.333, +5.085 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 05h 37m 20s
   Dec(J2000) = +05d 05' 07"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.7 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 01:24:21.6 UT, 84.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 84.33035, 5.08523 which
is equivalent to:
  RA(J2000)  = 05h 37m 19.28s
  Dec(J2000) = +05d 05' 06.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 9.5 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.34e+21
cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005), with an excess column of 4.5
(+4.33/-3.19) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). The relation of Grupe et
al. (2007) implies that this burst has a redshift z<4.3, although high
redshift fits to the absorbed XRT spectrum are possible if paired with
an anomalously large column. A summary of the promptly downlinked data
is given at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/308812/. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of  95 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 87 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The 3-sigma upper limit is about 19.5 mag. 
No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V)
of 0.78 mag.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
