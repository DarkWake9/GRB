GRB000301c optical observations 
  

The candidate for the optical transient (OT) associated with the gamma ray burst 
GRB000301c has been observed in imaging mode with MOS on the 3.6-m CFH Telescope
in the course of the French GRB follow-up program at CFHT (M. Boer, CESR, 
C. Veillet, CFHT).

Relative photometry in B and R with respect to the reference star A (GCN573)
is as following:


delta B = 1.29 +/- 0.05    2000 March 3.50 (UTC)
delta R = 2.19 +/- 0.05    2000 March 3.51 (UTC)

The R magnitude inferred from star A magnitude determination in GCN573 
is 20.24 +/-.07, in good agreement with the GCN 573 value of R = 20.28 +\- 0.05
measured at the same epoch.

B and R images can be found at
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~veillet/grb.html 

B calibrations will be made tonight if no multicolor photometry is made
available
for reference stars in the field.

D. Elbaz and H. Flores are acknowledged for their help in these observations.
