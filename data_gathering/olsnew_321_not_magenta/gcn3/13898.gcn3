(YNAO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 121024A (Pagani et al., GCN 13886) with 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope. Observations
started at 16:30:00 UT on 2012-10-24 (i.e., 13.6 hrs after the burst) and 2x900s R-band images were obtained. The optical afterglow of this burst was clearly detected. The results are as follows:

mid time from trigger (hr)    Mag.    Err.    Exposure time (second)
  13.69                       20.88   0.1      900
  13.81                       20.81   0.1      900  
   
We thank the GMG staff, especially Fang Wang, De-Qing Wang and Jian-Duo He for
performing these observations.
