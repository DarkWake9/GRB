E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"Beginning on March 5.67 UT we used the VLA to observe a field centered at
the position of the optical transient reported by J. P. U. Fynbo, et al,
and S.Bernabei, et al (GCN 570 and 571).  We detect a 300 microJy radio
source at 8.46 GHz, located at the position of the optical transient.  
Absolute flux calibration is not yet available.  Continued observations at
a broad range of frequencies are underway."

[GCN OPS NOTE (05Mar00 18:30 UT): This Circular (#590) is a duplicate 
of Circular 589.  The duplication is a result of a failure in the initial
submission and the nearly simultaneous second submission with a change
in the submittor's entry in the distribution list to allow the submitor
to use his new address.  Please use Circular 589 for all references.]
