Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 170113A, from 50 s to 19.1
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 243 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the
remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. 

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.2 ks) can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.14 (+/-0.10).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.88 (+/-0.07). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.82 (+0.26, -0.24) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.77 (+/-0.08) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 1.43 (+0.26, -0.25) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.9 x 10^-11 (4.7 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.43 (+0.26, -0.25) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 2.3 sigma
Photon index:	     1.77 (+/-0.08)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.14, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.030 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.2 x
10^-12 (1.4 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
