We observed the field of GRB 220813A (Bernardini et al., GCN 32465) 
using the ESO VLT/UT3 equipped with the X-shooter acquisition camera. 
Observations started at 08:06:45 UT on 2022-08-14 (i.e., ~12.73 hr after 
the BAT trigger) and consisted of 3x60 s, 4x60 s, 3x60 s exposures in 
the Sloan g-/r-/z- bands, respectively.

The previously reported optical afterglow (Bernardini et al., GCN 32465; 
Kuin & Bernardini, GCN 32470) is marginally detected in the stacked 
r-band image with r ~  21.8 mag (AB), and is not detected in g-band and 
z-band with upper limits of g > 22.1 and z > 19.9, respectively (both AB).

In addition, we note that from Legacy Survey there exists a source at 
coordinates R.A. (J2000) = 05:26:07.5 and Dec.(J2000) = -33:00:59.2, 
being consistent with the Swift/UVOT position, which has photometric 
magnitudes of g ~ 24.99, r ~ 24.28 and z ~ 23.76 as well as photometric 
redshift of z ~ 0.82, which is the likely host galaxy of GRB 220813A.

We thank the great support of the ESO VLT staff, in particular Steffen 
Mieske and Michael Abdul-Masih.
