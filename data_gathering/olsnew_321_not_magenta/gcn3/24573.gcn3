The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events
consistent with the sky localization of S190517h in a time range of 1000
seconds centered on the alert event time (2019-05-17 05:42:41.831 UTC to 2019-05-17 05:59:21.831 UTC)
during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. One track-like event
is found in spatial coincidence with the 90% spatial containment region of
S190517h calculated from the map circulated in the preliminary notice. This
represents an overall p-value of 0.094 (1.32sigma) with respect
to the background only hypothesis. Properties of the coincident event are shown below.

dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger.
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle representing 90% CL containment by area.
Pvalue = the pvalue for this specific track event with respect to a background only hypothesis

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
