The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:05:34 UT on 10 Nov 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191110A (trigger 595087539.99285 / 191110587).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 260.2, Dec = 43.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 17h 20m, 43d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 9.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 25.0 degrees.
