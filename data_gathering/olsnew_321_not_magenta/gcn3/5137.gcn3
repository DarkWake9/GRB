TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5137
SUBJECT: GRB 060515: Swift/XRT position

K.L. Page (U Leicester) and J.A. Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift/XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 060515 (trigger number 210084)  
~3.4 ks after the BAT trigger (Cummings et al., GCB 5132), the delay being
caused by the Earth limb constraint. Analysing the first orbit of data
(~2.5 ks of Photon Counting mode data), a faint, uncatalogued source was
found at

RA(J2000)  =  08 29 09.8
Dec(J2000) = +73 34 02.4 

with an estimated uncertainty of 4.9 arcsec. This source lies 59 arcsec 
from the initial BAT position quoted in GCN 5132.

Because there are only a small number of counts, it is not possible to say
for certain whether the source is fading, though there is an indication of 
a shallow decay slope.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
