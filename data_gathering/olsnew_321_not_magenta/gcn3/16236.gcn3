We observed the field of GRB 140508A (Yu, et al., GCN 16224) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2014/05 9.19 to 2014/05 9.46 UTC (25.61 to
32.04 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.27 hours
exposure in the r and i bands and 1.79 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H
bands.

For a source positionally coincident with the iPTF optical transient
(Singer, et al. , GCN 16226), in comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we
obtain the following detections:

  r     19.65 +/- 0.02
  i     19.52 +/- 0.02
  Z     19.36 +/- 0.03
  Y     19.20 +/- 0.03
  J     19.18 +/- 0.03
  H     18.98 +/- 0.03

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.  The source fades in time
approximately as t^(-1.5) in all bands during our observation.

Mártir.
