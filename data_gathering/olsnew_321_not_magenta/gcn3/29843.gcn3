We observed the field of GRB 210419C (Moss, et al., GCN 29834) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San
Pedro Mártir from 2021/04 20.14 to 2021/04 20.50 UTC (2.58 to 11.15 hours
after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 4.53 hours exposure in the r
and i bands and 1.89 hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

We do not detect any sources within the enhanced XRT error region
(Beardmore, et al. GCN 29839).  In comparison with the SDSS DR9 and 2MASS
catalogs, we obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

  r     > 23.60
  i     > 23.53
  Z     > 22.31
  Y     > 20.10
  J     > 22.21
  H     > 21.87

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
