"On March 29 2003 we have obtained R band photometry of the optical 
afterglow of GRB030328 (Peterson & Price GCN #1974) using DOLORES at 
TNG.  Observations were performed under moderate seeing conditions 
(between 1" and 1.5").

A preliminary analysis of the images allowed us to derive the following 
photometry for the OT calibrated by means of a Landolt standard field:

20.59 +/- 0.07 at UT 00:10:14, 12.82 hours after the burst
20.79 +/- 0.08 at UT 02:34:41, 15.23 hours after the burst

The photometry for the star "B" reported in GCN #1977 (Price and Peterson) 
turns out to be:

16.31 +/- 0.06

We are particularly grateful to the TNG staff for their remarkable support to 
these observations."
