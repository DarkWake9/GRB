"Following the detection by SWIFT of GRB
050219a (Hullinger et al. GCN Circ. 3038)
we imaged the error box with the 0.6 m
telescope at Mt. John Univ. Observatory.
We obtained 3 x 300s images with the MOA
camera (+ wide R-band filter) under poor
seeing conditions (4"- 5") starting on
19.613 Feb (i.e. 2.05 hr after the event).
Additional observations were performed with
a wide B-band filter. Comparison of the
stacked R-band image with the DSS-2 revealed
neither counterpart within the 6" radius 
X-ray afterglow position given by the 
SWIFT/XRT (Romano et al. GCN Circ. 3036) 
nor variable source to about R = 20.5 within 
the 4' radius SWIFT/BAT error box."
