We imaged the position of the reported Swift/UVOT transient (Breeveld
et al., GCN Circ. 24296), potentially corresponding to LIGO/Virgo trigger
S190425z (LIGO/Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 24168), with the NOFS
1.3-meter telescope. Nine 900-second exposures were taken in SDSS r (5)
and g (4). Examination and comparison to PS1 reveals no new sources
brighter than apparent SDSS r magnitude 22.3. Exposure times were
2019-04-28 08:44 to 11:12 UTC. Stacking images did not produce benefit
due to variable and worsening seeing.
