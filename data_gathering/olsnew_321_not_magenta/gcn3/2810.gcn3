At 4h 15m  after  INTEGRAL GRB trigger time (alert 2019)   MASTER robotic
telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru) had imaging  the corresponding area
of the sky under the nice weather conditions.
The first image was started at 15h23m UT.

We have 20 unfiltered images of the error box (30s exposition, 2.4 x 2.4
degrees, 355 mm telescope, Alta U16 CCD camera).
We can not find new stars with respect to DSS2 red images (R<21m).
