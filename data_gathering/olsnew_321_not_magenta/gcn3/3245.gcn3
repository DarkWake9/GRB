K. Torii (Osaka U.) reports

 "The error region of GRB 050412 (Cummings, et al. GCN 3237) was
observed with the 0.3-m telescope in the New Mexico Skies observatory.
Imaging through clear filter started at 05:48:13 UT (250-s after trigger) 
and 10 frames of 120-s exposure were obtained.

 We do not find an optical counterpart to the X-ray source
(Tamburelli, et al. GCN 3241) and derive its 3-sigma upper limit
relative to USNO-A2.0 (R) mag as follows.

MeanEpoch Magnitude Exposure
05:49:13 >18.9 120s
06:00:31 >20.5 10x120s
