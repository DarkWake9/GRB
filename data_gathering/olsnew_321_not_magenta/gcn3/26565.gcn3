SUBJECT: GRB 191221B: iTelescope optical observations

I observed the optical afterglow of GRB 191221B (Laha et al., GCN Circ.
26534) with remote telescope T32 (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + FLI Proline
16803 CCD) of iTelescope.Net in Siding Spring Observatory (Australia) on
2019-12-22 since 13:28:52 UT (~16.8 hours after the trigger). Two images
were obtained in each band with Astrodon luminance filter and
Johnson/Cousins V filter for 180 and 120 seconds (Binx2). I detected the
optical afterglow in three images in the enhanced Swift-XRT position
(Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 26540); it not present in images from DSS
Plate Finder.

The following magnitudes (mag. error ~ 0.2) were measured from comparison
to nearby stars from APASS DR9 catalogue (Henden et al., 2016):
