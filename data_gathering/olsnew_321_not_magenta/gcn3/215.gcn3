P. Garnavich, S. Jha, K. Stanek and M. Garcia (Center for Astrophysics)
report "an R-band image of the GRB990123 field was obtained with the
Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope and CCD camera on Jan 24.547 UT.
The Optical Tranisent (plus host galaxy) are easily visible and comparison
with star-3 of GCN Circular 204 (R=18.5) gives an R magnitude of 20.4
for the OT+galaxy.  This is consistent with the continuing t**(-1.5)
decline shown by Bloom et al. (GCN 208)."


This message is quotable in publications.


[GCN OP NOTE:  This circular was actually received at 17:59:03 UT, but was
delayed in distribution due to the submitter not having prior vetting.]
