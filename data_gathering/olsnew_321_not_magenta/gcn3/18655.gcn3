We observed the Southern probability maximum with BETA - the ASKAP 
engineering test array. The observations comprise 18 pointings covering 
a strip approximately 40 degrees long and 5 degrees high, centered on 
07h27m51s -70d15m39s (J2000) and following the ridge of the probability 
maximum.

We observed at center frequency of 863.5 MHz with a a bandwidth of 300 
MHz. Observing began at 2015-09-26 13:15:00 UT and continued for 19.5 hrs.

Our images have an average RMS of 1 mJy/beam. We cross matched all 
sources from our images with the SUMSS and MGPS2 catalogs, which are 
complete above 14 mJy. We found 3 sources not in the catalog, but visual 
inspection of the SUMSS [1] and MPGS2 [2] images indicates the presence 
of a source in all cases. Thus, we detect no transients above 14 mJy 
with respect to those surveys.

We continue to process another earlier observation of the same field.
