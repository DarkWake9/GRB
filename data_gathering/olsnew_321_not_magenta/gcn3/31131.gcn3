report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:09:46.84 UT on 20 November 2021, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
(GBM)
triggered and located GRB 211120B (trigger 659106591 / 211120548).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (DeLaunay et al. 2021, GCN
31101)

The GBM on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 47.9, DEC = 47.1 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 03 h 11 m, 47 d 6 '), with a statistical uncertainty
of 1.9 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only;
there is additionally a systematic error which we have characterized as a
core-plus-tail model,
with 90% of GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering
a larger than 10 deg systematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216,
32] )

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 62
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 36.1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-6.400 s to T0+33.537 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.99 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 298.2 +/- 26.3 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.184 +/- 0.60)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.28 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 180.1 +/- 24.3 keV, alpha = -0.79 +/- 0.08 and beta = -1.87 +/-
0.08.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
