P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), J.L. Racusin
(NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team

The Swift-XRT has observed the vicinity of GRB 131029A (Racusin et al.,
GCN 15399); gathering 600-900 s on each of 7 tiled pointings (see Evans,
GCN Circ. 15400), covering the entire LAT 90% error circle.

No credible X-ray afterglow has been found: we find three sub-threshold
(i.e. low significance) detections, 2 of which are near to catalogued
X-ray sources and the other is near to an object in SIMBAD.

The 3-sigma XRT upper limit for the field is approximately 0.01 ct/sec.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
