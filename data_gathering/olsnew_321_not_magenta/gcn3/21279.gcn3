and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,

K. Hurley, on behalf of the IPN,

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The long-duration GRB 170626B was detected by Insight (HXMT),
Konus-Wind, CALET (CGBM), and Swift (BAT) at about 3482 s UT (00:58:02).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated it to a Konus-BAT annulus centered at
RA(2000)=289.789 deg (19h 19m 09s)  Dec(2000)=-19.171 deg (-19d 10' 15"),
whose radius is 4.975 Â± 4.975 deg (3 sigma).

This annulus is inconsistent with the HXMT position reported
by Liu et al. (GCN 21265); also, the KW ecliptic latitude response
implies the source position close to the ecliptic plane, which
is ~30 deg from the HXMT localization.

A triangulation map is posted at

The Konus-Wind time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming
GCN Circular.
