The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 00:00:56 UT on 4 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201104A (trigger 626140861.749996 / 201104001).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 60.4, Dec = -72.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 01m, -72d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
