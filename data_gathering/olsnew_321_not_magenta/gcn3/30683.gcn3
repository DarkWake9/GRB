The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 17:30:24 UT on 22 Aug 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210822B (trigger 651346229.489012 / 210822729).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 238.2, Dec = 18.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 52m, 18d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 74.0 degrees.
