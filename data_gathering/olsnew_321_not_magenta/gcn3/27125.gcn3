A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA), J. A. Kennea (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 07:36:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200219A (trigger=957271).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 342.644, -59.108 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 22h 50m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 06' 29"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single
peak with a duration of about 1 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~15000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0.3 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:37:56.6 UT, 67.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
342.6376, -59.1200 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 22h 50m 33.02s
   Dec(J2000) = -59d 07' 11.8"
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 44 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.93 x
10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 6.1
(+3.05/-2.63) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.22e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 74 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.02.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
