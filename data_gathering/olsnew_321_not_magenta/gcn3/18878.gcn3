We observed the field of GRB 160117B (Swift trigger 670793, Sonbas et 
al., GCN 18875) using the LCOGT-1m located at the Siding Spring 
Observatory. Observations started at 14:20:45 UT on 2016-01-17 (i.e., 
1278 s after the burst), and a series of 180 s R-band images have been 
obtained. Further observations are ongoing.

The optical afterglow is detected at coordinates:

R.A. (J2000) = 08:48:46.74
Dec. (J2000) = -16:22:00.0

with an error radius of 0.2 arcsec, which is fully consistent with the 
UVOT position from GCN 18875. The afterglow has R = 18.3 +- 0.1 mag from 
the first 180 s exposure, calibrated with the nearby USNO B1 stars (R1 
magnitudes). The afterglow has been decaying rather slowly, with a decay 
slope of -0.5 +- 0.1 so far.
