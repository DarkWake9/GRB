The long GRB 070917 (Swift-BAT trigger #291292:
Cummings et al., GCN 6791; Tueller et al., GCN 6792) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=27239.542 s UT (07:33:59.542).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a duration of ~6 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 4.90(-2.76, +0.26)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.016 s
of 4.44(-2.65, +0.91)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted
(in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 1.36(-0.25, +0.21)
and Ep = 211(-48, +95) keV (chi2 = 58.9/60 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
