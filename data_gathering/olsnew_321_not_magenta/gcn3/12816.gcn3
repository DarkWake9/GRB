We observed the field of INTEGRAL Weak trigger #6433 with the
14-inch Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT) located at the Goddard Geophysical
and Astronomical Observatory (http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).

A total 242 good quality images of 5 sec (200 images) and 30 sec (42 images) 
exposures were taken in the R filter starting from Jan 6 05:11:52 (UT), 
about 58 seconds after the trigger (53 seconds after the notice), and 
stopped on Jan 6 06:08:10 (UT).  We do not detect the optical afterglow 
both in the individual images and the stacked image inside the 3.65 arcmin 
error circle.  The estimated five sigma upper limit of the combined 
image (total exposure of 2260 sec) is ~17.4 mag using the USNO-B1 
catalog.
