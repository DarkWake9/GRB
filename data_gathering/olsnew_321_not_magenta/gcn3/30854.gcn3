M. Perri (SSDC & INAF-OAR), V. D'Elia (SSDC & INAF-OAR), A. D'Ai
(INAF-IASFPA), J. D. Gropp (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and
A. Tohuvavohu report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 1.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 210919A (Tohuvavohu et al.
GCN Circ. 30846), from 105 s to 1.6 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position
for this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN Circ. 30850). We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01073893.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
