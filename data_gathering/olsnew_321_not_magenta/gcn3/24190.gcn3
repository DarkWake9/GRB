collaboration:

We performed the search for the optical counterpart of LIGO/Virgo 
S190425z (GCN 24168) using the 0.9-m Schmidt telescope located at 
Xinglong, Hebei, China. Observations started at 12:40:09 UT on 
2019-04-25 and ended at 13:42:18 UT on 2019-04-25, and the 1.5 x 1.5 
deg^2 imager scanned high probability regions of the LVC localization 
that are accessible to the Xinglong/Schmidt telescope. The unfiltered 
images were taken with 60 sec exposure time and typical limiting depth 
is around 18 mag.

The searching was stopped by growing heavy clouds. Listed below are the 
field centers
observed.
