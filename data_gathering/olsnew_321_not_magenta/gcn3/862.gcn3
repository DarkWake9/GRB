SUBJECT: GRB001007: Optical observations

P.A. Price (Caltech), O. Pevunova, B. Madore (IPAC) and S.G. Djorgovski
(Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the afterglow candidate of GRB001007 (Price et al.,
GCN #843, Frail & Berger, GCN #860) with the Palomar 60-inch telescope
with 4x900s exposures starting at Oct 25.34 UT.  We do not detect
the candidate to a limiting magnitude of R = 21.6 (based on the
reference star from GCN #843, for 50% automated detection of artificial
stars in the field).  The derived temporal decay slope between our two
epochs (Oct 10.69 and Oct 25.34) is alpha > 1.9 ."
