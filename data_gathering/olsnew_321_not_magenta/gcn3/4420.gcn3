P.A.Milne (Steward Obs),
on behalf of the Super-LOTIS GRB team reports:
                                                                               
We observed the field of GRB 051221B (SWIFT-BAT trigger 173904)
on Dec. 21, 2005,
starting at UT=02:35:53 (06:32:33 after the burst) 
with the 61" Kuiper telescope at Mt. Bigelow, AZ.
We obtained 11 x 300-sec R-band images.
Observing conditions were considered good. The field was
subsequently observed the next night starting at UT=01:33:50.
We obtained 7 x 300 second images in the R-band on the second night.
                                                                               
Inspection of a subtraction image produced from co-added images
reveals no fading source at the location of the candidate
optical counterpart reported by Halpern & Tyagi (GCN 4381).
The limiting magnitude of the co-added image taken on the
first night is roughly 23.0 magnitude.
