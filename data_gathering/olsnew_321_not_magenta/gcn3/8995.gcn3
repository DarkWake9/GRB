A. N. Morgan, J. S. Bloom, D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley),  and D. Starr
(UCB, LCOGT) report:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 090313 (Mao et al. 2009, GCN
8980) with PAIRITEL beginning at 2009-03-13 09:39 UT, 31 minutes after
the Swift Trigger.  We detect the afterglow (Chornock et al., GCN
8979) in all 111 47-second mosaics of 7.8 second simultaneous
exposures in the J, H, and Ks taken throughout the night.

Preliminary lightcurves indicate a shallowing of the temporal decay
rate during the 3.5 hours over which the afterglow was observed.  The
preliminary photometry yields:

No correction for Galactic extinction has been made to the above
reported values.  Further observations are being taken tonight.
