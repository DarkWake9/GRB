The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:09:13 UT on 18 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201218B (trigger 630011358.922416 / 201218798).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 82.2, Dec = 26.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 05h 28m, 26d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 60.0 degrees.
