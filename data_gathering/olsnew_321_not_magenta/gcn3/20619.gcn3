SUBJECT: GRB 170206B: Enhanced Swift-XRT position

FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 1338 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT  image, we find 
an astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT 
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, 
Dec = 271.77061, 11.19366 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  18 07 04.95
Dec (J2000): +11 11 37.2

with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest 
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
