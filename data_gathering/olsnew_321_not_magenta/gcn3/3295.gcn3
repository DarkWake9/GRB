J. A. Kennea, C. P. Hurkett, D. N. Burrows (PSU), V. Mangano 
(IASF/Palermo), T. Sakamoto (GSFC/NRC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC) report on 
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

The Swift BAT instrument detected a GRB at 22:35:54 UT on 16th April 2005 
(GCN Circ 3279). Due to the close proximity of this burst to the moon, the 
observatory did not executed an automated slew at that time. This burst 
became visible to Swift Narrow Field Instruments at 12:48:00 UT on 20th 
April 2005, and was observed by Swift-XRT as a pre-planned target. From 
ground processed data we find a uncatalogued X-ray source within the BAT 
error circle, located at:

RA(J2000) = 08:55:35.2,
Dec(J2000) = +11:10:32.

We estimate an uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds radius (90% containment). 
This position is 152 arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 
3284. This source should be considered a tentative afterglow candidate, we 
are currently performing further observations to determine if the source 
is fading.
