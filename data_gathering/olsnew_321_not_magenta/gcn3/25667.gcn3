The GRB 190829A (Dichiara et al. GCN Circ 25552) was observed at Stroncone 
Observatory (MPC 589) with the 50cm R-C telescope, a CCD SBIG camera
and the I_Cousins filter. Nine frames with 300s exposure each were
obtained: Bias, Flat and Dark current corrections were applied with IRAF
standard tasks.
Aperture photometry was performed with IRAF/apphot. The contribution
from the underlying galaxy was subtracted assuming a symmetric light
distribution, and evaluated about 0.2 mag. Comparison stars were taken
from PanSTARRS-DR1 (i') and GSC2.3.2 (N) with very consistent results
besides the zero point offset.
Mid-exposure time was 2019-08-30T00:47:15 UT; the magnitude of the GRB
was I_C=16.7 corrected for the galaxy contribution but not for reddening.
