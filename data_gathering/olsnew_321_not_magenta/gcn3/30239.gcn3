The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 23:33:53 UT on 15 Jun 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210615A (trigger 645492838.603514 / 210615982).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 342.9, Dec = 62.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 51m, 62d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 7.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
