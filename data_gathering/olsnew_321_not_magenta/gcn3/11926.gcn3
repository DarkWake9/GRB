Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:33:35.71  UT on 12 April 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110412A (trigger 07:33:35.71  / 110412315) which was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Gelbord et al. 2011, GCN 11922). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single peak with a duration (T90) of about 16 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.5 s to T0+18.9 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.7 +/- 0.1 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 87 +/- 5 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.2 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+5.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 2.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
