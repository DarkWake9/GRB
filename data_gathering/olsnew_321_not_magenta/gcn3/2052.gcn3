F.E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), C. Markwardt (U.Md. & NASA/GSFC),
and J.H. Swank (NASA/GSFC) report:

RXTE re-observed GRB 030329 for a total of 3.9 ks
starting at March 30.724 UT (about 1.240 days after the burst).
The flux was about 0.9e-11 ergs/s/cm**2 in the 2-10 keV band
or about 15 times weaker than during the RXTE
observation the previous day (Marshall and Swank, GCN 1996).
The total light curve is well described by a simple model
in which the flux decays as t^(-1.5).
More complicated models are also consistent with the 
sparsely sampled data. For example, 
a model in which the decay rate increases 
from  t^(-1.1) at early times (Burenin et al., GCN 2024) to
t^(-1.934) at late times (Garnavich et al., GCN 2018;
Smith, GCN 2019; Halpern et al., GCN 2021)
fits the data if the break occurs 0.54 days after the burst.
