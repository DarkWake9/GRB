Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141225A (trigger #622476)
(D'Avanzo, et al., GCN Circ. 17229).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 138.754, 33.774 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  09h 15m 01.1s
    Dec(J2000) = +33d 46' 27.7"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 26%.

The burst location first entered the BAT field of view at ~T-40 sec, during a
pre-planned slew.  The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-shaped
peak, beginning at T+5 sec, peaking at T+12 sec and returning to baseline level
by T+50 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 40.24 +- 7.04 sec sec (estimated error 
including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+5.50 to T+50.68 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.32 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.5 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.76 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 
1.3 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
