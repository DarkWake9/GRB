J.Mangan (UCD), S. Lesage (UAH) and C.Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the
Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:12:47.41 UT on 28 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220528A (trigger 675411172 / 220528259), which
was also
detected by the Swift/BAT-GUANO (Raman et al. 2022, GCN 32148 and GCN
32149).

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization has been reported in GCN 32147.

The GBM light curve consists of a single peak with a duration (T90) of
about 0.58 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.128 s to T0+0.576 s is best fit by a
power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is 0.08 +/- 0.17 and the cutoff
energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 467.5 +/- 50.8 keV
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.59 +/-
0.11)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.2 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:
