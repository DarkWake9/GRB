on behalf Swift team:

We report that trigger number 149131, previously designated GRB
050805B, is retracted.  This trigger is consistent with a cosmic ray
shower event in the detector, and a simultaneous random image
fluctuation.

Ground analysis of the XRT data does not show any X-ray source in the 
field. We therefore conclude from the XRT data that Trigger 149131 is not 
a GRB.

As a separate note, the BAT position notice was delayed by ~42 seconds
on board the spacecraft, due to a backlog of TDRSS telemetry caused by
a commanded procedure.
