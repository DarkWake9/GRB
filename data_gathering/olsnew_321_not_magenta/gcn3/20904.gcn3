Swift Team:

At 12:11:56 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 170318A (trigger=743065).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 305.645, +28.409 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 22m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = +28d 24' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 12:13:44.4 UT, 108.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 305.66565,
28.40652 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 20h 22m 39.76s
   Dec(J2000) = +28d 24' 23.5"
with an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 65 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 4.45
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 6.78e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 116 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the large, but uncertain extinction expected.

Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
