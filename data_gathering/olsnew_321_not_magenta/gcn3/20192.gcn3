B. Mailyan (UAH) and A. Goldstein (USRA) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 01:35:31.36 UT on 17 November 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 161117A (trigger 501039335/161117066),
which was also detected by Swift (Cummings et al., GCN 20179).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 94 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows bright, multiple peaks with a duration (T90)
of about 122 s (50-300 keV).  The time-averaged spectrum
from T0-4.7 s to T0+129.4 s is adequately fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 68.04 +/- 2.66 keV, alpha = -0.43 +/- 0.07, and beta = -2.27 +/- 0.04.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
 (3.93 +/- 0.079)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+116 s in the 10-1000keV band is 10.3 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
