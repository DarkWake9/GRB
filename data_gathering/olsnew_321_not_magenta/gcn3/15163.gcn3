Using the data set from T-240 to T+902 sec from the
recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis
of BAT GRB 130831B (trigger #568855) (Malesani, et al.,
GCN Circ. 15141). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 192.454, -29.187 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  12h 49m 48.9s
   Dec(J2000) = -29d 11' 13.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat,
90% containment). The partial coding was 14%.

BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a multi peak
episode starting from ~T-12 sec highest peak
around T+1 sec and ending at ~T+30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 37.8 +- 10.4 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-13.9 to T+30.6 sec
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power
law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.88 +- 0.21.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon
flux measured from T-0.05 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.4 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are
at the 90% confidence level.
