report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S200129m at T0 = 2020-01-29
06:54:58.435 (UT) a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that
the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less than 10% of
the 90% c.l. localization region (LR) (due to solar panel constraints).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV -
10 GeV over time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of the
S200129m 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are obtained:

from 8.3e-07 to 9.1e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 51% of the LR over
the time interval ( T0 + 100s ; T0 + 200s );

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
