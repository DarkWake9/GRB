Using the data set from T-239 to T+574 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061126 (trigger #240766)
(Sbarufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 5854).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 86.615, 64.201 deg {5h 46m 27.6s, 64d 12' 3.0"} (J2000)
+- 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 49%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve starts at T-10 sec with four main overlapping peaks.
The brightest peak occurs at T+7 sec.  The last peak ends at ~T+25 sec
with an on-going low level emission out to ~T+200 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 191 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.0 to T+411.0 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.2 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+6.66 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 9.8 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
