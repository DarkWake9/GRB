report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long burst, 
GRB 211216A, at 2021-12-16T06:45:56.050 UTC (denoted as T0), which was also 
observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #31237).
 
GECAM alert data was downlinked to the ground through the short message
service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) within ~60 s after T0.

According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of a broad pulse
with a duration of about 20 s. 

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Using the automatic on-ground localization pipeline with the BDS alert data, 
GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): 
Ra: 57.22 deg 
Dec: -63.04 deg
Err: 5.71 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees 
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

GECAM location is consistent with the Fermi/GBM position within the error.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
