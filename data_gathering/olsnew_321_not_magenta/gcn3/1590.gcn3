IRAM Millimeter detection of GRB 021004
=================================================

The GRB afterglow has been observed with the IRAM Plateau de 
Bure Interferometer in a six-antenna compact configuration 
under good meteorological conditions from UT October 5th 22:17 to 
October 6th 2002 01:02.

 The source has been detected at 86.233 GHz (8.3 sigma).
 Upper limits have been obtained 231.700 GHz.

We have used the coordinates by Fox et al. (GCN 1564), detecting the
source at offsets d_RA 0.21"(+-0.42"), d_DEC +0.47" (+-0.30").
Results of UV point source fits fixed to the phase center are given below.

 Frequency       Flux and 1 sigma error            Beam size
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 86.233 GHz       2.5 (+-0.3) mJy/beam         8.44" x 4.96" at PA=76 deg
231.700 GHz       1.9 (+-1.5) mJy/beam         3.50" x 1.63" at PA=76 deg

We will continue to monitor the source.
