Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 190211A (trigger #888648)
(Marshall, et al., GCN Circ. 23883).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 196.652, 41.976 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 06m 36.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 58' 32.1" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 26%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a a pair of peaks, the first from T-12 to T-5 sec,
and the second from T-4 to T+2 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 12.48 +- 1.46 sec (estimated 
error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-11.49 to T+1.66 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.51 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.5 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.56 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
