The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 16:12:01 UT on 10 Aug 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190810A (trigger 587146326.24257 / 190810675).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 192.8, Dec = -38.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 51m, -38d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 17.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 115.0 degrees.
