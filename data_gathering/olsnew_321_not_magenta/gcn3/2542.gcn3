TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2542
SUBJECT: IBAS results on a burst from SGR1806-20

D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano) for the ISDC IBAS Localization Team,
F. Mirabel (CEA, Saclay)  and the INTEGRAL Science Working Team report:

We confirm that the burst of IBAS alert n.1563 (GCN 2541) originated from
SGR1806-20.

The burst was detected with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument in the 15-100 keV
energy range, during the INTEGRAL Core Program Galactic Center Deep
Exposure, at 10:24:08.35 UT of March 9.

The preliminary estimate of the burst fluence in the 15-100 keV energy
range is 2.2 x 10-7 erg cm-2.

We remind that IBAS is also distributing real time Alert Packets for
bursts from known SGR positions (see ISDC Newsletter n. 14
http://isdc.unige.ch/Newsletter/N/#ibas and GCN 2415).

SGR 1806-20 will be in the INTEGRAL field of view for various time
intervals in the next few days, thus possibly giving rise to other IBAS
alerts.
