and the CALET collaboration:

The long-duration GRB160316A (Fermi-GBM trigger #479828730; INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7425) 
triggered the CALET Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 13:45:16.8 on 16 March 2016.  
The burst signal was detected by all CGBM instruments.  

The light curve of the SGM shows a single peak.  The emission starts at T0+8 sec, 
peaks at T0+10 sec and ends at T0+23 sec.  The T90 duration measured by the SGM data 
is 10 +- 1 sec (40-1000 keV). 

The CGBM data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center 
located at the Waseda University.
