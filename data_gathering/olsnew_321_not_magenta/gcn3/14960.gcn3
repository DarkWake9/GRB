S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We have observed the location of the Swift GRB130701A (Kuin et al., GCN
14953) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope. Observations were
obtained in non-photometric conditions in the r', i', and z' filters
beginning at 06:52 UT on 2013 July 1 (2.58 hr after the Swift trigger).
Using nearby point sources from SDSS for photometric calibration, we
measure afterglow magnitudes of r' = 19.57 +/- 0.12 and i' = 19.36 +/-
0.10 at approximately this time.  Compared with the earlier detection from
the NOT (Leloudas et al., GCN 14954), this implies a power-law decay index
of alpha ~ 1.0.
