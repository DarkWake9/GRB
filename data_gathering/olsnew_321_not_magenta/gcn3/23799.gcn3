The INTEGRAL trigger 8208 and 8209 on Sun 27 Jan 19 at 13:48:0 UT, 8205 
at 10:02:09, 8206 at 11:14:56, 8207 at 11:48:05,  8210 and 8211 at 
14:22:49  are all due to flaring activity of the newly discovered source 
MAXI J1348-630  (ATeL #12434  #12430  #1242). It is NOT a GRB.

IBAS triggered because the source was not blacklisted, yet. We apologize 
for the inconvenience this might have caused.
