D. A. Perley and E. Bellm (Caltech) report:

We imaged the location of GRB 120219A (Swenson et al., GCN 12964) with 
the Keck I telescope (+ LRIS) on 2012-02-20 (UT) between 10:22-10:41 UT. 
  Observations suffered from strong attenuation due to clouds and poor 
seeing (>2 arcsec).  In a stack of our two deepest individual 200 second 
R-band frames (at 10:27 and 10:32) UT, we detect no source to a limiting 
magnitude of R > 24.0 mag.  The afterglow is also not detected in our 
g-band or I-band images.  If the reported object of Xin et al. (GCN 
12966) represents a real source, this apparent fading confirms it as the 
afterglow of GRB 120219A.
