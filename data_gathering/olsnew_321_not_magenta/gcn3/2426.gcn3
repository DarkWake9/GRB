K. Hurley and T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Mars Odyssey
GRB teams,

I. Mitrofanov, S. Charyshnikov, V. Grinkov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak, and
A. Sanin, on behalf of the HEND-Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr, on
behalf of the GRS-Odyssey GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Mars Odyssey (GRS) observed this burst at 33817 s
+/- 55 s (the uncertainty is due to the fact that no near-Earth
spacecraft has reported this event yet).  From the limited data
available at this time, the duration appears to be >~350 s,
the 25-100 keV fluence ~5 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and the peak flux
over 0.5 s ~2 x 10^-6 erg cm^2 s^-1.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered
at RA, Decl.(2000)=168.621, +16.880, whose radius is 65.036 +/- 0.019
degrees (3 sigma).

This localization can be improved, particularly if the event
was observed by any near-Earth spacecraft.
