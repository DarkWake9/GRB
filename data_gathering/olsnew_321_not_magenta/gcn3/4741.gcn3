MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) responded to GRB060211.7 (GRB_TIME is 2006-02-11 15:55:14.76).
The first image was at 2006-02-11 15:59:57 UT, 00:04:42.24  after the
  GRB time  (after opening the roof under snow).
The unfiltered image is calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (0.8 R + 0.2 B).
The robot not find OT-candidate in error box brighter then  14.5 (s/n=3).
The reduction is continuing.
