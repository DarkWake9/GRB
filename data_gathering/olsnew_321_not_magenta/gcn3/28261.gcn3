FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely long GRB.

At 23:57:18.34 UT on 18 August 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located GRB 200818A (trigger 619487843 / 200818889).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 207.6, Dec = +22.1(J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 +13h 50m, +22d
07'), with a statistical uncertainty of 12 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67 degrees.
