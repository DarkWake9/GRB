TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  14230
SUBJECT: GRB 130216A: P200 NIR Observations
DATE:    13/02/17 14:01:31 GMT
FROM:    Daniel Perley at Caltech  <dperley@astro.caltech.edu>

D. A. Perley (Caltech) and S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) report:

We imaged the BAT position of GRB 130216A (Melandri et al., GCN 14223; 
Barthelmy et al., GCN 14299) on 2013-02-17 (UT) in Ks-band at two 
different epochs: 9 one-minute exposures between 02:56 and 03:08 
followed by 18 one-minute exposures between 05:46 and 06:13.  The FOV 
covers the entire BAT error circle.

No new sources are seen in the field relative to the 2MASS catalog. 
Digital image subtraction of the two epochs gives a limit on variability 
of Ks >~ 18.7 mag (5 sigma) between 4.77 and 7.74 hours after the BAT 
trigger.
