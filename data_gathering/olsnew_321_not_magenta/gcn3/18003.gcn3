The short-duration GRB 150710A (Swift trigger 648437:
Bernardini, et al., GCN Circ. 18000) triggered Konus-Wind
at T0=1681.682 s UT (00:28:01.682).

The burst light curve shows a short, double-peaked pulse with
a total duration of ~0.1 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of
(3.7 ± 0.7)x10^-7 erg/cm2, and a 16-ms peak flux,
measured from T0-0.048 s, of (7.6 ± 1.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

Since the bulk of the burst emission was detected before
the trigger, the spectral analysis was performed using
the KW 3-channel light curve data.

Modeling the 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0-0.048 s to T0+0.048 s) by a power law
with exponential cutoff (CPL) model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -0.28 ± 0.54, and Ep = 308 ± 70 keV.

Following Bernardini, et al. (GCN Circ. 18000),
we note, that the burst, as observed by Konus-Wind,
is comparable in hardness and other aspects to a typical
short GRB from the KW sample.
The figure showing the GRB 150710A position in the hardness-duration
diagram (logT50-logHR32) of 1143 KW bright GRBs is available at

The contours denote the 1, 2, and 3 sigma confidence regions for
two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The vertical dashed line at
T50=0.6 s marks the boundary between short and long KW GRBs.

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
All the presented results are preliminary.
