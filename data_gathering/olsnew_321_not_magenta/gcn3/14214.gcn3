Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130215A (trigger #548760)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 14204).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 43.486, 13.387 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 53m 56.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 23' 13.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 8%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve starts at ~T-10 sec, peaks at ~T+10 sec,
and slowly returns to baseline at ~T+170 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 65.7 +- 10.8 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.83 to T+73.38 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.59 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.4 +- 0.5 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.5 +- 0.7 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 
 
The results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/548760/BA/

We note that the BAT trigger occurred during a telemetry downlink session
during which the real-time TDRSS messages (that GCN uses) are buffered on-board
until the end of the downlink.  For this trigger the minimum bufferring delay
to the ground was 692 sec.
