On 21 September 2004, the Chandra Observatory targeted the field of 
GRB040912, an X-ray flash localized by the HETE satellite (=H3557; 
Butler et al., GCN 2701; Olive et al., GCN 2723).  This was a 20 ksec 
followup observation to the observation beginning on 15 September 
reported by Butler et al. (GCN 2716).  It spanned the interval 10:56 UT 
to to 17:01 UT on September 21, 8.86-9.12 days after the burst.  The 
WXM error circle from Butler et al. (GCN 2701) was completely contained 
within the field-of-view of the Chandra ACIS-I array.

At the location of the 22 X-ray sources reported in our Epoch 1 (E1)
observation (GCN 2716), we find:

In this table, "<Cts_E1>" refers to the number of counts detected in
E1, scaled to the exposure in E2.  The number of counts detected in E2 for 
each source is reported in the column labeled "Cts_E2," and the probability 
that the source remained constant given the E1 and E2 detected count rates 
is presented under "Null_Prob."  

We note that source #13 has not faded between our two epochs, and this 
strongly dis-favors the candidate OT of Butler et al. (GCN 2728).

Several sources appear to have faded at or beyond the 2-sigma significance
level (#'s 4,17,19,and 22).  However, given the 22 trials conducted to find 
the candidate X-ray afterglow, only source #4 exhibits a statistically 
significant decline in brightness (3-sigma single trial, ~2-sigma in 22 
trials).  The decrease in count rate from source #4 between E1 and E2 
implies a temporal decay index of alpha=-0.9+/-0.3.  We determine a refined 
position for this source of:

RA= 23h 56m 42.96s, Dec= -0d 55' 19.8" (J2000), 

with an uncertainty of 1".  A faint (R~24) optical source, spatially 
coincident with this position, was reported by Butler et al. (GCN 2728).  
However, this source did not appear to decrease in flux between t_burst 
+ 13.57 hours and t_burst + 38.65 hours.

We gratefully acknowledge the timely assistance of the observatory staff 
at the Chandra Science Center in arranging for the acquisition and 
preliminary processing of these data.
