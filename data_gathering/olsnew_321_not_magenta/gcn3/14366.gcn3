N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. Cucchiara (UCSC/UCO Lick Observatory)
and S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 130408A (Lien et al. GCN 14361,
Melandri et al. GCN 14362, Siegel et al. GCN 14363) with the GMOS-S
spectrograph on Gemini-S, beginning approximately 1 hr 56 mins after
the BAT trigger.  The integration was 4x600s and the wavelength
covered approximately 3950-6700A.

We detect numerous lines, including Lyman alpha, beta, gamma,
SII1250, SII1253, CII/CII*1260, SiII*1264, OI1302, SiII/OI*1304, SiII*1309,
CII/CII* 1334/1335, SiIV1394/1402 at a common redshift of z=3.757.

We thank D. Krogsrud for performing the observation.
