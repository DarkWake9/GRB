A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO), J. Gorosabel, A. Sota, A.J. Castro-Tirado
(IAA-CSIC) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of GRB 090313 (Mao et al. GCNC 8980)
with the 1.5m OSN telescope (Granada, Spain) starting on  22:29 UT
(13.4 hours after the burst). Our I-band images show that the optical
afterglow reported by Chornock et al. (GCNC 8979) is still bright.
Preliminary photometry yields I=17.7+/- 0.3. This would imply that the
plateau phase reported by Perley et al. (GCN 8985) is still ongoing,
half a day later.

Further observations are encouraged
