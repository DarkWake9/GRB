A. Corsi (GWU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 140129A (Melandri et al., GCN #15760) 
using the the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in C-band, and starting at 
00:57:45 UT on 30 Jan 2014.  A provisional reduction shows no radio emission 
above the 3-sigma level of 30uJy (the map rms is ~10uJy at 5 GHz) within the Swift 
XRT error-circle (Evans et al. GCN #15764). The flux density at the P60 optical 
afterglow position (Perley & Cenko, GCN #15761) is -8 +/-10 uJy at 5 GHz. 

We thank the VLA staff for executing these observations.
