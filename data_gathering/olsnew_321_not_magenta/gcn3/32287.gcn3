Gayathri Raman (PSU), Aaron Tohuvavohu (U Toronto), James DeLaunay
(UAlabama), Jamie A. Kennea (PSU), report:

Swift/BAT did not localize GRB 220627A onboard (T0:
2022-06-27T21:21:00 UTC, Fermi/GBM GCN 32278, INTEGRAL trig #9970, ).

The INTEGRAL and Fermi/GBM notices, distributed in near real-time,
triggered the Swift Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray
Urgent Archiver for Novel Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al.
2020, ApJ, 900, 1).

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 90 seconds of BAT event-mode data from
[-45,+45] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested
event mode data was delivered to the ground.

The BAT likelihood search, NITRATES (DeLaunay + Tohuvavohu,
arXiv:2111.01769), detects the burst with a sqrt(TS) of 31 in a 16.384
s analysis time bin.

NITRATES results indicate a burst coming from outside of the coded
FoV, with DeltaLLHOut of -70. The NITRATES maximum likelihood sky
position is consistent with the Fermi GBM and LAT localization region.

See Section 9.1 and Figure 20 in the NITRATES paper for brief
descriptions and interpretation of sqrt(TS), DeltaLLHPeak, and
DeltaLLHOut.

GUANO is a fully autonomous, extremely low latency, spacecraft
commanding pipeline designed for targeted recovery of BAT event mode
data around the times of compelling astrophysical events to enable
more sensitive GRB searches.
