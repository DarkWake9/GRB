Using the data set from T-239 to T+603 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 170906A (trigger #770957)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 21821).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 203.949, -47.088 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  13h 35m 47.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -47d 05' 18.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple peaks starting at ~T-40 sec,
with a max peak at ~T+30, and returning to baseline at ~T+170 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 88.1 +- 1.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-44.9 to T+121.5 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.21 +- 0.10, 
and Epeak of 205.4 +- 71.9 keV (chi squared 36.4 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.0 x 10^-5 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+29.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
10.9 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.45 +- 0.02 (chi squared 52.7 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
