TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  268
SUBJECT: GRB 990123, Field Photometry
DATE:    99/02/26 18:13:16 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

BVRI photometry in the field of GRB 990123 was performed with
the USNO 1.0-m telescope in Flagstaff during the February dark run.
Results of that photometry have been posted at:
  ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb990123.dat
with a more complete description of the photometric procedures in:
  ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb990123.readme

Objects 1-18 in the photometry file are numbered identically to
Nilakshi, et. al. (GCN 252).  Other objects are either fainter
stars in the same field, or else brighter stars within the 11x11
arcmin field of the CCD to be used for field identification.
We have omitted the obviously extended objects 7, 9, and 16.
We note some photometric differences between Nilakshi and this
new photometry.
