TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16718
SUBJECT: GRB 140818B : Correction to GCN 16713
DATE:    14/08/19 13:15:25 GMT
FROM:    Karla Varela at MPE  <kvarela@mpe.mpg.de>

F. Knust, K. Varela, and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on behalf of
the GROND team:

The afterglow candidate reported in GCN 16713 is the same as the one
reported by Aceituno et al. (GCN 16711) located at the edge of the 1.9
arcsec XRT error  circle at:

RA (J2000): 18:04:32.47
Dec (J2000): -01:23:09.7

The GROND i’-band magnitude suggests it has decayed by about 2 magnitudes
within 3.5 hours, thus confirming this source to be the afterglow of GRB
140818B.

The magnitudes of the second source reported correspond to a source at the
edge of the 3.9 arcsec XRT error circle at :

RA (J2000): 18:04:32.78
Dec (J2000): -01:23:08.43

We apologize for this mistake.
