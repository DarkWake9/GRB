"We have imaged the GRB 050716 X-ray afterglow position (Rol et
al. GCN 3623; J. Kennea et al.  3264) with B and R band using Lulin
1-m telescope. The observation was started at 14:30 (0.079 days after
the burst) after rising the field. These images show no optical
counterpart brighter than B=21.6 and R=21.3. These 3-sigma limiting
magnitudes are derived from the USNO-B1.0 catalogue.
