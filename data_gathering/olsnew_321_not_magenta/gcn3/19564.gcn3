The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160525B (Krimm et al., GCN 19459) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 May 25.55, May 26.66, May 
28.66, and May 31.68 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Beardmore et al., GCN 19463), with 3sigma upper limits of 99 
uJy, 63 uJy, 66 uJy, and 96 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
