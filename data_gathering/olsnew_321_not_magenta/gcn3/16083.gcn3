behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:21:40 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible source near the known galaxy A0732-5019 (trigger=595162). 
Swift did not do an immediate slew because of an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 113.599, -50.408, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 34m 24s
   Dec(J2000) = -50d 24' 26"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers, the real-time TDRSS
light curve does not show anything significant. 

Due to a delayed slew, there are no immediate data from the XRT or UVOT
instruments. We will report on those data when they become available. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. D'Elia (delia AT asdc.asi.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
