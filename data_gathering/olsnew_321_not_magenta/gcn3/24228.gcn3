The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:

We have re-analyzed LIGO data around the time of the compact binary
coalescence (CBC) candidate S190425z (GCN 24168). Parameter
estimation has been performed using LALInference [1] and a new sky
map, LALInference.fits.gz, is available for retrieval from the
GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190425z

For the LALInference.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 7461
deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity
distance estimate is 156 +/- 41 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard
deviation). This is the preferred sky map at this time.

For further information about analysis methodology and the contents
of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide
