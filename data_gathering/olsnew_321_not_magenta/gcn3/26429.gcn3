We obtained an optical spectrum of a number of transients discovered by 
ZTF (Andreoni et al. GCN 26424) within the localization region of 
S191213g (LVC, GCN #26402)

All spectra were obtained on the night of 2019 Dec 14 using the ACAM 
instrument mounted on the William Herschel Telescope located on the 
Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain.

AT2019wnn / ZTF19acymcna shows strong Halpha emission at z=0.2, which 
together with its location in the nucleus of its host galaxy is 
consistent with an AGN outburst.

AT2019wni / ZTF19acymcwv is a Type Ia supernova around +10d from maximum 
light, at a redshift z=0.09.
