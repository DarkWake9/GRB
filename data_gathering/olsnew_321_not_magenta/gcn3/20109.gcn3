report:

We imaged the field of GRB 161023A detected by Integral
(trigger 7613, Mereghetti et al., GCN 20103)
with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 0.55 day after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from
72 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We detected the candidate couterpart mentioned by Gorbovskoy
et al. (GCNC 20102) and Tanvir al. (GCN 20104). We used the same
calibration star than Guidorzi et al. (GCNC 20107):

t0+0.55d to t0+0.63d : R = 19.09 +/- 0.05

Magnitudes are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
