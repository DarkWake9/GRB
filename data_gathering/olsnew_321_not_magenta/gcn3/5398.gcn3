At 04:47:49 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060805 (trigger=222683).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 220.919, +12.592
{14h 43m 41s, +12d 35' 32"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty). 
The BAT light curve shows a single peak with a duration of about ~5 sec. 
The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec
after the trigger. 

The XRT began taking data at 04:49:22 UT, 93 seconds after the BAT
trigger. Although the XRT on-board centroid algorithm did not find a
source in the image, ground analysis reveals a faint source at RA,
Dec 14h 43m 43.59s, +12 35 11.8 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 5.9
arcsec. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the white filter
starting 97 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. Image catalog data are
not available at this time. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the BAT error circle. The list of
sources is typically complete to about 18.0 mag. No correction has
been made for the expected extinction of about 0.1 magnitudes.
