TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  10871
SUBJECT: GRB 100621A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    10/06/21 03:40:05 GMT
FROM:    Shashi Bhushan Pandey at ROTSE  <shaship@umich.edu>

S. B. Pandey (U Mich), W. Rujopakarn (Steward), T. Guver (U Arizona), W.
Zheng (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 100621A (Swift trigger 425151; Ukwatta T. N., GCN 10870),
producing images beginning 5.0 s after the GCN notice time. An automated
response took the first image at 03:04:05.0 UT, 32.2 s after the burst, and
during the gamma-ray emission, under fair conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10
20-sec and 10 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered images are calibrated
relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle; the field is not
crowded. Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.1-17.3;
we set the following specific limits.
