The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 08:15:25 UT on 14 Jul 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200714B (trigger 616407330.91385 / 200714344).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 190.4, Dec = -54.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 41m, -54d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 84.0 degrees.
