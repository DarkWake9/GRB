Consortium:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 180510B (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 
22696; Schady et al., GCN 22701) with the ESO VLT/X-shooter 
spectrograph, covering the wavelength range 3000-21000 AA.
The afterglow is clearly detected in the 10s acquisition images taken 
starting at 23:09 UT (~3.7 hours after the GRB trigger) with brightness 
R~19.8 (Vega), calibrated against USNO-B1 stars in the field. 
Spectroscopy started at 23:19 UT on 2018-05-10 (~3.9 hours after the GRB 
trigger) and consisted of 2 exposures of 600 s.

Preliminary analysis of the spectrum reveals continuum flux down to 3600 
AA, which sets an upper limit to the redshift z <~ 2 via the lack of any 
obvious DLA feature. In addition, we identify several absorption lines 
at a common redshift of z=1.305, the most prominent being ZnII/CrII, 
FeII, MgII, and MgI. Moreover, we also identify another absorption 
system at z=0.63 based on the detection of the MgII doublet. Therefore, 
we propose the most probable redshift of the GRB to be z=1.305, with an 
intervening system at 0.638.

We acknowledge the excellent support from the ESO staff, particularly 
Boris Haeussler, Karleyne Silva and Emanuela Pompei in obtaining these 
observations.
