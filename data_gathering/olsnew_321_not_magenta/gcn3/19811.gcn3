The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
160714A (Siegel et al., GCN 19697) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jul 14.65, Jul 17.85, and 
Jul 21.85 (UT) do not reveal any variable radio source within the BAT 
error circle (Palmer et al., GCN 19705), with 3sigma upper limits of 150 
uJy, 213 uJy, and 132 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
