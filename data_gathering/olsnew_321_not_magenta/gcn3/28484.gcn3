Using the data set from T-239 to T+871 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 200922A (trigger #997024)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 28471).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 296.954, -55.199 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 47m 49.0s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 11' 55.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 74%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like pulse that
starts at ~T-2 s, peaks at ~T+0, and ends at ~T+16 s.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 10.30 +- 1.96 sec (estimated error including
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.91 to T+16.22 sec is best fit
by a power law with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon
index 1.43 +- 0.26, and Epeak of 39.3 +- 5.7 keV (chi squared 52.48
for 56 d.o.f.).  For this model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV
band is 2.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2 and the 1-sec peak flux measured
from T-0.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 11.4 +- 0.5 ph/cm2/sec.
A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index of 2.12 +- 0.06
(chi squared 76.50 for 57 d.o.f.). All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
