GRB040912 (= H3557): Chandra Observations Scheduled

G. Ricker, P. Ford, N. Butler, R. Vanderspek (MIT), and  D. Lamb (U. 
Chicago), on behalf of a Chandra GRB ToO Team,

write:

Chandra target-of-opportunity observations of the entire HETE WXM 
error circle for GRB040912 (= H3557: Butler et al, GCN 2701) have 
been approved and scheduled, subject to possible high background 
radiation constraints. The first epoch observation will commence near 
22h UT on 15 September, with a second epoch observation ~1 week later.

As noted by Butler et al (GCN 2701), although GRB040912 exhibits the 
spectral characteristics of an XRF, its temporal characteristics are 
quite unusual. The scheduling of contemporaneous observations at 
other wavelengths, especially deep initial and second epoch optical 
and IR observations, is strongly encouraged.

We are grateful to Harvey Tananbaum and Andrea Prestwich for 
approving this DDT observation.
