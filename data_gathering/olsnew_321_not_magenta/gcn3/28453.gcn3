Ayvazian (AbAO),  G. V.  Kapanadze (AbAO),   A. Volnova (IKI), I. 
Molotov (KIAM)  report on behalf of IKI-GRB-FuN:

We observed the two candidate counterparts from ZTF (Reusch et al., GCN 
28441) of the neutrino event IceCube-200916A (Blaufuss et. al, GCN 
28433) with  AS-32 telescope of Abastumani observatory in R-filter.
In stacked images we cannot resolve point like sources of the 
candidates. Photometry of candidates include their (presumably) 
underlying host galaxies and presented below.

The photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars

In the case of AT2020tno the brightness is not distinguished from 
magnitude of underlying object in catalogues.
The brightens of AT2020tnp  is might be somewhat brighter than reported 
by ZTF (r=20.41 +/- 0.14; Reusch et al., GCN 28441) and apparently 
brighter than reported in catalogues.
