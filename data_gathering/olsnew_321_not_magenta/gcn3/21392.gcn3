S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo, and 
J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

further analysis of the possible GRB 170730A detected as a subtrheshold 
alert by IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:09:20 UT of July 30, 2017 (Gotz 
et al. GCN 21390) yields the refined coordinates (J2000):

R.A.= 245.2996 deg
DEC.= -60.8866  deg

with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst lasted about 500 s, with a peak flux of about 0.6 photons/cm2/s 
(20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range 
of about 1e-6 erg/cmq. The time averaged spectrum is consistent with a 
power law with photon index ~2

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
