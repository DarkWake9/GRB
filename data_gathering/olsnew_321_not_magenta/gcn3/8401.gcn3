W. Li, R. Chornock, and A. V. Filippenko, University of California
at Berkeley, on behalf of the KAIT GRB team, report:

The robotic 0.8-m KAIT located at Lick Observatory responded to
GRB 081024 (G. Stratta, GCN 8398) automatically and started
the first image at 05:54:42 UT (94 seconds after the burst).
A series of images were taken in the V, I, and clear filters.
No new sources were detected within the Swift/XRT error circle
in the KAIT images (single or stacked frames) when compared to
the DSS II. We set the following specific limiting magnitude 
in a stacked unfiltered image (2s x 10; USNO B1 calibration): 

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim
