A. C. Updike, H. A. Eid, and D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University)
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team:

We imaged the field of GRB 070406 approximately 26 hours after Swift
Trigger 274153 with the SARA 0.9m at Kitt Peak under good weather conditions.
We obtained 20 300-second exposures in the R band.  We find no fading OT
candidate in the stacked images down to a limiting magnitude of R = 20.0
+/-  0.2 mag (based on calibration to USNO A2.0).
