The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North in Hawaii began observing Swift
GRB 151027B (Ukwatta et al., GCN 18499) on October 28, 12:18:25 UT, i.e.,
~ 13.6 hours after the burst trigger, with the r' and i' filters.

Although we did not detect the optical counterpart (Malesani et al.,
 GCN 18501; Xu et al., GCN 18505; Wiseman et al., GCN 18507;
Buckley et al., GCN 18511; Watson et al., GCN 18512) in the r'
filter (R > 20.3), the source is detected in the i' filter with
I = 19.6 +/- 0.3 mag at a mid time of 13.9 hours post burst
(total exposure in i' of 600 s).

The magnitude is calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 stars.
