Y.-D. Hu, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC),  C. Perez del Pulgar,  A. Castellon, I. Carrasco, A. Reina (Univ. de Malaga), R. Fernandez-Munoz (IHSM/UMA-CSIC) and F. Rendon (IAA-CSIC and INTA-CEDEA), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

Following the Swift trigger of GRB 200801C, a likely flare from AX J1846.4-0258 (Krimm et al., GCNC 28187), the 60cm BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) automatically responded to this event. A series of images were taken starting 20:13:18.40UT (91 s after trigger, clear filter). In the co-added 10s exposure image, no soure is detected within the BAT 3' error box radius down to 17.7 mag.

Later on, the 0.3m BOOTES-1B robotic telescope in Mazagon (Huelva), southern Spain, started gathering images at 20:31:01UT (19.2 min after trigger) after the twilight. In the co-added of 10 s exposure images (clear filter), no new source is detected down to 16.9 mag.

The images limiting magnitude were affected by the presence of the full moon 22 deg away. The above-mentioned non-detections are consistent with the limit reported by MASTER (Lipunov et al., GCNC 28186).

We thank the staff at INTA-CEDEA and at IHSM/UMA-CSIC La Mayora for their excellent support.
