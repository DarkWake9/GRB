S. B. Cenko (Caltech), D. B. Fox (Penn State), R. McNaught and B. Peterson
(RSAA/ANU) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have imaged the HETE localization region for GRB 051022 (Graziani, GCN
4131) with the Siding Spring Observatory 40-inch telescope.  Our
observations consisted of 4 x 100 s images in R-band, taken at a mean
epoch of 13:23:35 UT (~ 15.6 min after the burst).  We find no new sources
inside the SXC error circle when compared to the Digital Sky Survey.  Our
limiting magnitude, calculated with respect to several Guide Star Catalog
sources in the field, is ~ R > 20.0."
