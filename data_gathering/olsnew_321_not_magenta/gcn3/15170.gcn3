V. Sudilovsky, D. A. Kann, and J. Greiner (all MPE Garching) report on
behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 130903A (INTEGRAL trigger 6930; Mereghetti et
al. 2013, GCN #15169) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et
al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La
Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 07:07 UT on 03 Sep. 2013, 6.3 hours after the GRB
trigger, as soon as the GRB field became visible. They were performed at
an average seeing of 1".5 and at an average airmass of 1.7.

Based on an image with an exposure time of 25 min in g'r'i'z' and 20 min
in JHK, centered 7.37 hours after the GRB, we do not detect any
uncatalogued sources within the 90 arcsec INTEGRAL error circle in
comparison to the SDSS and 2MASS catalogs.
