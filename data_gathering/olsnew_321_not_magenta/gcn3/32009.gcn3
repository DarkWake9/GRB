The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB.

At 10:09:05.75 UT on 7 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220507A (trigger 673610950 / 220507423).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is 
RA = 222.1, Dec = 53.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 14h 48m, 53d 13'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54 degrees.
