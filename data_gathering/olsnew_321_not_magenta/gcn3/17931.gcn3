Kosmas Gazeas and Konstantinos Sapountzis (National Univ. of Athens) report:

Swift trigger 643949 occurred in June 15, 2015 and followed a few  
minutes afterwards with the 0.40 m f/8 robotic telescope at the  
University of Athens in R-band. Data collection has started on June 15  
(UT) 18:58:37 and finishing on June 15 (UT) 20:28:09 (mid-exposure  
time). The bright GRB seems to be the X-ray binary V404 Cyg,  
consisting of a black hole and a late G-type companion. A sum of 30  
exposures of 180 sec each was collected. Photometry with a 3 pixel  
(approximately 4 arcsec) radius aperture yields an R magnitude  
estimation of R = 12.65 +/- 0.01 mag in the beginning of data  
acquisition and R = 15.43 +/- 0.03 mag at the end. There is a  
luminosity fading trend of ~2.7 mag/hour as observed during the first  
hour of acquisition. Fading rate dramatically decreased afterwards,  
reaching the value of ~0.2 mag/hour. Differential photometry was  
performed utilizing the nearby stars, namely USNO 1200-15039207  
(Rmag=12.9) and USNO 1200-15046396 (Rmag=12.7), located 140 arcsec  
west and 96 arcsec southeast of the source, respectively. No further  
absolute photometric calibration has been applied on these data. The
