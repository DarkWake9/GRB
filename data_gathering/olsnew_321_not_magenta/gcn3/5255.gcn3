GRB 060614: Swift/UVOT Observations

S. T. Holland (NASA/GSFC & USRA) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT
team:

      The Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB 060614 at
12:45:29 on 2006-06-14, 101 s after the BAT trigger (Parsons et al.,
GCN Circular 5252).  An optical counterpart was detected in the White
filter (160-650 nm) at a position (RA,Dec) = (21:23:32.08,
-53:01:36.2) (J2000) with a 90% confidence interval of 0.56
arcsec. The optical afterglow was detected in the White, V, B, U,
UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 filters.  The detection in all of the UVOT bands
suggests that the redshift is less than approximately 1.1.

      The photometry results are given for the UVOT filters below:

Filter   T_mid(s)    Exposure(s)    Mag   Err
    V       5753         189        19.54 0.30
    B       5143         196        19.91 0.21
    U       4937         193        18.81 0.14
  UVW1      4730         189        18.35 0.17
  UVM2      5959         193        18.06 0.23
  UVW2      5552         195        18.26 0.17
White       147          92        18.30 0.14

The values quoted above are not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction of E_{B-V}=0.02 (Schlegel et al. 1998).
