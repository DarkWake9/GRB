Matthew Stanbro (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 17:00:45.01 UT on 22 November 2015, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 151122A (trigger 469904449 / 151122709)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Palmer et al. 2015, GCN 18637).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 51 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 30 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.10 s to T0+29.70 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -2.23 +/- 0.06.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.18 +/- 0.15)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.77 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 1.97 +/- 0.26 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
