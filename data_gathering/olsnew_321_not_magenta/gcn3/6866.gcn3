A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), C. Guidorzi (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB),
P. Romano (Univ. Bicocca & INAF-OAB), report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT observed the GRB 071008 (trigger=293587, Moretti et al., GCN
Circ. 6856) beginning 57 ks after the BAT trigger.  In 6857s of Photon
Counting mode data spanning 57-65 ks after the trigger in the BAT
error circle we found 2 faint sources at RA,Dec =151.58851,44.32071
and RA,Dec =151.55340, 44.34459 which are

RA(J2000) = 10 06 21.24  Dec(J2000)= +44 19 14.5
RA(J2000) = 10 06 12.82  Dec(J2000)= +44 20 40.5

with error circles of radius 6.5 and 7.5 arcseconds (90%, including
boresight uncertainties) respectively.

They are at 116 and 40 arcseconds from the BAT position, respectively.
At present, due to the paucity of the observed events, we are unable
to determine whether these sources are fading.  Further observations
will be planned when the distance to the Sun will be larger.


This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
