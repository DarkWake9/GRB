Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140628A (trigger #602803)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 16467).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 40.672, -0.378 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 42m 41.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -00d 22' 39.8" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve ~3 overlapping peaks starting at ~T-15 sec,
peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
10.5 +- 0.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.24 to T+11.12 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.56 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.94 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
