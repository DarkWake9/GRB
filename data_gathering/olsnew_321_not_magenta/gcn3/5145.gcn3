behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical transient of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al. GCN 
5117; Mundell et al., GCN 5119) with the 3.6m TNG telescope located in 
the Canary Islands. Two mid-resolution spectra (~10 A FWHM) were 
obtained with TNG+DOLoRes, starting on 2006 May 13.0423 UT, for a total 
exposure time of 40 minutes. The spectra cover the range 4000-8000 A.

Inspection of the spectrum does not reveal any obvious absorption 
system. We find no signs of the continuum break around 4800 A reported 
by Starling et al. (GCN 5131). Our spectrum shows a continuum extending 
blueward down to ~4000 A (the limit of our grism), suggesting z < 2.3.

We thank the observing staff at TNG.
