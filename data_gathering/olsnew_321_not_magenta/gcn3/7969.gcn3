Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080710 (trigger #316534)
(Sbarufatti, et al., GCN Circ. 7957).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 8.259, 19.484 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 33m 02.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +19d 29' 00.8" 
with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a weak emission starting around T-120 sec, 
and then, following a FRED like spike starting from T+0 sec and ending at 
T+43 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 120 +- 17 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-96.9 to T+43.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.47 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.89 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
