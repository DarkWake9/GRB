C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara), A. Gomboc (U. Nova Gorica), S. Kobayashi 
(LJMU), C.G. Mundell (U. Bath), on behalf of a large collaboration report:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope automatically began observing INTEGRAL GRB 
160401A (Mereghetti et al. GCN 19251) on April 01, 20:23:44 UT, i.e. 3.2 
minutes since the GRB trigger time. From the subtraction of two 3x10-s 
r-band frames taken at 46 and 68 minutes post GRB trigger we do not 
detect any uncatalogued, significantly variable object within the 
INTEGRAL error circle down to r~20 mag calibrated against nearby USNOB-1 
stars, in agreement with previous reports (Rebolo et al. GCN 19252).
