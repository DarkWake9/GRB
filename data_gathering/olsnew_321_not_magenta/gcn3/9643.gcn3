of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR telescope system responded to Swift trigger
356890 (Morris et al., GCN 9625) under good observing conditions.
Our narrow-field instruments began observing the location at
07:39:03.4 UTC, 28.8 s after the Swift trigger (7.1 s after
receipt of GCN message).  We obtained simultaneous observations
during the gamma-ray emitting interval in Cousins V, R, and I
bands as well as unfiltered data.  We do not detect the counterpart
observed by the Subaru Telescope (Aoki et al., GCN 9634) and
PARITEL (Morgan et al., GCN 9635).  The data from our unfiltered
and filtered systems was calibrated to the USNO-B1 catalog.  We
can put the following limits on the prompt emission:

t-mid(s)          exp(s)   filter  mag    mag-err
[since trigger]
