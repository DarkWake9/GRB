Alberto Carramiñana (INAOE) and Hugo Ayala (PSU) report on behalf of 
the HAWC collaboration (http://www.hawc-observatory.org/collaboration):

On 2020/09/21 19:07:13 UTC, the IceCube collaboration reported a track-like 
very-high-energy event that has a moderate probability of being an astrophysical 
neutrino, IceCube-200921A. Location is at 
RA: 195.29 (+2.35/-1.73 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 26.24 (+1.51/-1.77 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
(GCN circular 28468).

We performed two types of analyses for the follow-up. The first is for a steady 
source in archival data and the second is a search for a transient source. 
We assume a power-law spectrum with an index of -2.3 for both analyses.

- Search for a steady source in archival data:
The archival data spans from November 2014 to May 2018. We searched
inside the reported IceCube error region.
The most significant location, with p-value  2.51e-04 (2.85e-02 post-trials),
is at RA 193.67 deg, Dec +25.86 deg (±0.10 deg 68% containment) J2000.
We set a time-integrated 95% CL  upper limit on gamma rays at the
maximum position of:

E^2 dN/dE = 3.03e-13 (E/TeV)^-0.3 TeV.cm^-2.s^-1

- Search for a transient source:

The event was in our field of view at the time reported. Data acquisition 
started on 2020/09/21 16:13:38 UTC and ended 2020/09/21 22:39:47 UTC.
The most significant location, with p-value 2.02e-04  (2.30e-02 post-trials),
is at RA 197.67 deg, Dec +25.82 deg (±0.17 deg 68% containment) J2000.
We set a time-integrated 95% CL upper limit at the position of maximum 
significance of:

E^2 dN/dE = 1.63e-11 (E/TeV)^-0.3 TeV.cm^-2.s^-1

HAWC is a very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory operating in Central
Mexico at latitude 19 deg. north. Operating day and night with over
95% duty cycle, HAWC has an instantaneous field of view of 2 sr and
surveys 2/3 of the sky every day. It is sensitive to gamma rays from
300 GeV to 100 TeV.
