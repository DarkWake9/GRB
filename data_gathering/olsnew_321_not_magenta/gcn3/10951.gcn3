SUBJECT: GRB 100713A: a long GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF- Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), E. Bozzo, A. 
Taylor, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf 
of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a gamma ray burst lasting about 20 s has been detected by IBAS in the 
IBIS/ISGRI data at 14:36:06 U.T. on July 13th.

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

RA: 255.209 [degrees]
DEC: 28.390 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux in the 20-200 keV range of about 
0.4 ph/cmsq/s (1 s integration time) and a fluence over the same energy 
range of about 2 10e-7 erg/cmsq.


A plot of the light curve will be posted at
