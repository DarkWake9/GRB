Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array to observe the field of view toward
GRB 090401B (GCN 9066) at a frequency of 8.46 GHz on 2009 Apr. 02.15
UT. The GRB radio afterglow is undetected at the Swift-UVOT position 
(GCN 9067). The three-sigma flux density of the GRB afterglow at the
Swift UVOT position is 138 uJy.
