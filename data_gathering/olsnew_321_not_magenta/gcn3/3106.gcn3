After  HETE alert 3693   MASTER robotic telescope (http://observ.pereplet.ru)
had  imaging  the corresponding area of the sky  under the good weather
conditions.  We have about 50  unfiltered images of the error box (30s
exposition, 6 square  degrees field) started at 16 Mar 2005	21:13:01
UT (103 s after   GRB time).
The limiting magnitude on the images was about 18.0.

We have about 50 low resolition spectra (50A) 40'x30' area.
The JPG-images (with possible candidate and asteroids)  are available at
http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB050316/2.jpg
This is preliminary result.
