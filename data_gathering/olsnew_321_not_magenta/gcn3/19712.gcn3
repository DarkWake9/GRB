Gendre B. (UVI - Etelman Obs.) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 160714A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 704310) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 40s after the GRB trigger
(20s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
34 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+40.0s to t0+100.0s : Rlim = 16.3

The second image is 30.0s exposure in tracking mode:
t0+115.7s to t0+145.7s : Rlim = 17.5

We co-added a series of exposures:
t0+115.7s to t0+412.9s : Rlim = 18.9

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
