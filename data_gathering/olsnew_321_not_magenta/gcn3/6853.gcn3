P. Chandra (UVA/NRAO) and  D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We observed the field centered on the BAT position of the Swift burst
GRB 070923 (GCN#6837) using the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz
and starting at 1.85 UT on Oct 5, 2007. We detect the radio afterglow at
KAIT optical position (GCN#6838) with flux density of 393 +/- 55 uJy.

Further observations are planned.
