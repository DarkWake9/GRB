report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 17:29:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a third outburst from SGR 0501+4516 (trigger=321252).
Swift was already observing this source (from the previous triggers,
GCNs 8112 and 8113).  The BAT light curve again shows a single spike
with a duration less than 128 msec.  The peak count rate was ~4000 counts/sec
(15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger.
