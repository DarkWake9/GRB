A. Rau (Caltech), E.O. Ofek (Caltech) and D.B. Fox (Penn State) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of GRB060923C (Stamatikos et al., GCN 5591) on
UT 2006 Sep 23.58 (30 minutes post trigger) with the Low Resolution
Imager and Spectrograph at Keck-I. Observations were performed at high
airmass (3.1).

Within the XRT error circle, we detect a single point-like object,
with I~21 mag, at coordinates:

    R.A. 23:04:28.4, Dec. +03:55:29 (J2000)

We note that this source is marginally detected in the Palomar Optical
Sky Survey (DSS) at a similar brightness.
