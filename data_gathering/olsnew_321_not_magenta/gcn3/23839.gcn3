A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands) reports on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed Swift GRB 190202A (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 23803) with
the LCO 1-m units at CTIO on January 2, from 06:49 to 07:40 UT
(corresponding to 0.2 to 0.25 hours from the GRB trigger time)
with the SDSS r' and i' filters.

We performed a series of 10x120s in both filters and we clearly
detect the optical afterglow (Novichonok et al. GCN 23831) with
the following  magnitudes:

r' = 19.57 +-  0.04
i' = 19.19 +- 0.05

These magnitude are calibrated against several SDSS objects
near the GRB location and are not corrected for Galactic Extinction.

These observations were possible thanks to the USVI NASA-EPSCoR
Research Infrastructure Development (RID) grant NNX16AL44A.
