TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4327
SUBJECT: GRB 051211B: a long GRB detected by INTEGRAL
DATE:    05/12/11 23:22:59 GMT
FROM:    Sandro Mereghetti at IASF/CNR  <sandro@iasf-milano.inaf.it>

S. Mereghetti (IASF, Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), N. Mowlavi, D.Eckert, 
M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

A GRB lasting about 80 s  has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI 
data at 22:05:44 on December 11 2005.
Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

RA:  345.688 [degrees]
DEC:  55.079 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

Its preliminary peak flux (20-200 keV, 1s integration time) is about 0.8
ph (8x10e-8 erg)/cmsq/s. Its fluence (20-200 keV, 80 s integration time) 
is 2x10e-6 erg/cmsq.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
