J. Kelemen (kelemen at konkoly.hu) on behalf of the GRB OT observing program
at the Konkoly Observatory.

Starting on the evening of 11/05/2012 we observed the field of GRB 120422A
(Troja et al., GCN 13243) 19.448 days after the burst, using a 50 cm
Cassegrain telescope located at the Mountain Station of the Konkoly
Observatory equipped with an Andor iXon + 888 EMCCD camera through R and I
filters. On the coadded R images (exp.time 600 sec) we could not detect the OT
associated SN (Giorgos Leloudas GCN 13275)and the nearby galaxy (SDSS
J090738.51+140108.3)(A. Cucchiara GCN 13245). Based on a nearby star
(USNO-A2.0 0975-06157109) we provide 19.07 +/- 0.26 magnitude in the R band as
an upper limit.
