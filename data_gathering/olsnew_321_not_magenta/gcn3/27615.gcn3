FROM:    Rachel Hamburg at UAH  <rkh0007@uah.edu>

R. Hamburg (UAH) and P. Veres (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team:

For the IceCube high-energy neutrino candidate event 200421A (GCN 27612),
the reported position:

RA: 87.93 (+3.44/-2.83 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 8.23 (+2.09/-1.84 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

was occulted by the Earth for Fermi-GBM from approximately from 16.2
minutes prior until 18.1 minutes after event time. Therefore, the GBM
observations are not constraining for prompt gamma-ray emission.
