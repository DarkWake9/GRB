A.J. Levan (U. Hertfordshire), N.R. Tanvir, E.Rol (U. Leicester), A.
Fruchter (STScI), A. Adamson (JAC) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed the location of GRB 060814 with UKIRT beginning at 05:50 UT
(approximately 7 hours post burst). Observations were obtained in the
K-band. Within the refined XRT error circle (Moretti GCN Circ. 5451) we 
find a single source at

RA: 14:45:21.1 (J2000)
DEC: +20:35:09 (J2000)

With a magnitude of K~18. We suggest this may be the IR afterglow of GRB
060814.

Further observations are planned.
