P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and J.A. Kennea (PSU) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT observed the blazar WISEA J145820.77+412101.9 for 4.9 ks, 
starting at 15:07 UT on 2022 June 28. This blazar was posited by the 
Fermi team (GCN Circ. 32285, ATEL #15478) to be the potential 
counterpart to a new gamma-ray source, Fermi J1458.0+4119, itself a 
possible counterpart to the high energy neutrino IceCube 220624A (GCN 
Circ. 32260).

The Swift observations show an approximately constant count-rate of 
9+/-2- x 10^-3 ct/sec. A spectrum created from the 26 photons detected 
can be fitted with a power-law with a photon index of 3.0 (+1.8, -1.1) 
absorbed by a column NH = 1.0 (+2.8, -1.0) x 10^21 cm^-2; the large 
uncertainties arising due to the low number of counts. This corresponds 
to a 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.72 (+1.14, -0.60) x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

The HEASARC X-ray Master catalogue reports several ROSAT fluxes for this 
source, ranging from 3--10 x 10^-13 erg cm^2 s^-1. Converting our 
spectrum to the ROSAT PSPC energy band (0.1-2.4 keV), we find a flux of 
1.5 (+3.3, -0.4) x 10^-13 erg cm^2 s^-1. Thus, presuming that the 
catalogued fluxes correspond to quiscence (which is not guaranteed), we 
find no evidence for an X-ray outburst from WISEA J145820.77+412101.9.
