TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: Swift Trigger 618391 is not an astrophysical event

S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 04:21:55, BAT made an image trigger while the Swift
had lost star tracker lock.  As a result, it mistakenly
identified Sco X-1 as a new source.  Due to a Sun constraint,
Swift will not slew to the calculated position and
current observations will not be affected.
