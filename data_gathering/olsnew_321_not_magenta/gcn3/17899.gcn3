Leicester), V. D'Elia (ASDC), A. D'aì (INAF-IASFPA) and P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the
Swift/BAT-detected burst GRB 150530B (Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 17895),
collecting 4.8 ks of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+239.2 ks
and T0+247.3 ks. 

No X-ray sources have been detected inside or close to the Swift/BAT
error region. The 3-sigma upper limit in the field ranges from ~0.003
to ~0.004 ct s^-1, corresponding to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of
1.0e-13 to 1.5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

Four uncatalogued sources were detected too far from the GRB position
to be likely afterglow candidates.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020522.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
