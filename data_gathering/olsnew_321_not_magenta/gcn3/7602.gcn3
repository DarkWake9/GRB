Christina C. Thoene, Daniele Malesani, Paul M. Vreeswijk, Johan P. U.
Fynbo (DARK/NBI), Pall Jakobsson (Univ. of Hertfordshire), Cedric Ledoux
and Alain Smette (ESO) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 080413A (GCN 7593, Rykoff & Rujopakarn;
GCN 7594, Stamatikos et al.) on Apr. 13 starting UT 06:36 with UVES at the
VLT. Spectra of 2700 s with low S/N were acquired in the DIC 2R and
2B settings covering the wavelength range between 3250 and 9000 AA.
We detect several narrow absorption features including SII, Si II, CII,
Fe II, AlII, C IV, Si IV as well as broad Lyman alpha absorption at the
highest redshift system which has z=2.433 and is very likely the redshift
of GRB 080413A.

We thank the Paranal staff for executing the observations, in particular
Swetlana Hubrig and Jose Cortes.
