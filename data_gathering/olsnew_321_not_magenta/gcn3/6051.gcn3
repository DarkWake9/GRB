-----------------------------

Observer: D. T. Durig (CLW01)

Report: I had to stack 148 images, but I finally got the SNR to 3.1. I
could clearly see it in stacks of 60, 90 and 120 but the SNR was only
between 2.5 and 2.8. I lost two images to wind, so only added the best
148 frames.  Position 07 51 17.70 +31 09 04.3 GIF image posted to
