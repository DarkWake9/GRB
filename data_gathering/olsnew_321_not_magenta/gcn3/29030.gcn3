We observed the field of Swift discovered GRB 201203A (Dichiara et al., GCN
28985, D'Elia et al., GCN 28990) with the 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical
Telescope (DFOT) at Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute
of Observational Sciences (ARIES), India. We observed a series of images
~7.774 hours after the burst in both R and I (300sx6 in each) filters
(Johnson-Cousins) covering Swift UVOT position (Sakamoto et al., GCN
28995). Preliminary photometry on the stacked images was performed and
calibrated against USNO-B1 catalog stars. We do not detect any OT candidate
(Jelinek et al., GCN 28986, Watson et al., GCN 28987, Zheng et al., 28988,
Niwano et al., GCN 28992, Kumar et al. 28993) within the enhanced XRT
position. The upper limits in the stacked images are the following:

DATE       UT (start)  Filter Exposure(sec) Frames    Upper limit (mag)
2020-12-03 14:38:54    R      300           6        21.4
2020-12-03 15:11:18    I        300           6        21.2
