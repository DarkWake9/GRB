J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), J. A. Kennea (PSU),
H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and
T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:16:37 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a likely new galactic transient source (trigger=557674).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 256.064, -37.457 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 17h 04m 15s
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 27' 24"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The full BAT light curve is not yet available
so we cannot say anything about its structure.  

Since the source is near the galactic plane glon=348.10,  glat=+2.36 and
is of very long duration (768 seconds), we do not believe that it is a
GRB, but rather it is likely to be a new galactic transient.  

We also note that the source identified in the original GCN alert is
more than a degree away from the trigger position, so is most likely not
the source of the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, the slew to this target was delayed. 
We will report on XRT and UVOT observations in a later GCN Circular.
