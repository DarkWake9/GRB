TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13106
SUBJECT: GRB 120326A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    12/03/26 01:47:12 GMT
FROM:    Wiphu Rujopakarn at U AZ/Steward  <rujopakarn@gmail.com>

W. Rujopakarn (Steward) and H. Flewelling (IfA/Hawaii) report on
behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIId, located at the Turkish National Observatory at
Bakirlitepe, Turkey, responded to GRB 120326A (Swift trigger 518626;
Siegel et al., GCN 13105), producing images beginning 9.9 s after the
GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image at
01:20:51.9 UT, 22.6 s after the burst, under fair conditions. We took
10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 10 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered images
are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle, for both
single images and coadding into sets of 10. Individual images have
limiting magnitudes ranging from 14.7-16.7; we set the following
specific limits.
