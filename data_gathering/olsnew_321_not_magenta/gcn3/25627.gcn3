Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed GRB 190829A (GCN # 25551, 25552) with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in band 5 (1050â€”1450 MHz) on 2019 Sep 02.11 UT. In our preliminary analysis of the software backend data, we detect a radio afterglow with the flux density of 800+/-55 uJy at the optical afterglow position of the GRB (GCN # 25558). 

We thank the staff of the uGMRT that made these observations possible. uGMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. More observations are planned.
