T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:42:27 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 090726 (trigger=358422).  Swift did not slew immediately
to the burst due to an Earth constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 248.819, +72.871 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 16h 35m 16s
   Dec(J2000) = +72d 52' 15"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a small precursor
at T-20 followed by a single FRED structure overlaid with rapid
variability with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~10 sec after the trigger. 

Swift will not slew until T0+48.9 minutes. There will be no 
XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (kpa AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
