We again observed the field of GRB 130831A (Hagen, et al., GCN 15139) with
the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on
the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional
on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/09 4.32 to 2013/09 4.34 UTC (90.60
to 91.04 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 0.36 hours
exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.15 hours exposure in the Z,
Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN 15147),
in comparison with SDSS DR9 and 2MASS, we obtain the following upper limits
(3-sigma):

  r'    > 22.84
  i'    > 22.94
  Z     > 20.76
  Y     > 20.23
  J     > 20.09
  H     > 19.49

In comparison with earlier RATIR observations (Butler et al., GCN 15165)
the source has faded by 2.2 magnitudes in the r' band and 2.6 magnitudes
in the i' band. This implies a power-law decay steeper than t^-1.7. The
upper limits obtained in the Z, Y, J, and H bands are also consistent with
such a steep decay index. These magnitudes are in the AB system and not
corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Mártir.
