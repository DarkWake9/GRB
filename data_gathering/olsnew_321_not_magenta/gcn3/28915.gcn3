A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH/IAA-CSIC, DARK/NBI), D. A. Kann, M. Blazek, 
C. C. Thoene, J. F. Agui Fernandez (all HETH/IAA-CSIC), and A. Sota 
(IAA-CSIC) report:

We observed the location of the Swift XRT source #3 found in tiled Swift 
observations (Evans, GCN #28906), potentially the (X-ray) afterglow of 
Fermi GBM/LAT GRB 201116A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN #28897; Kunzweiler et 
al., GCN #28898; Axelsson et al., GCN #28907) with the 1.5m telescope of 
the Observatorio Sierra Nevada, in Granada, Spain. We obtained 15 x 180 
s images in Rc, beginning 2020-11-17 03:24:46.56 UT, 1.1076 days after 
the GRB.

We detect a faint source in the Rc-band stack at (J2000)

RA   =  09:57:17.94
Dec. = +00:16:34.1

with Rc = 23.18 +/ 0.18 mag (AB), as measured against multiple SDSS 
comparison stars.

This source is not visible in SDSS or PanSTARRS imaging, suggesting it 
is the GRB afterglow. We cannot determine evidence for fading, however.

We wish to congratulate the SpaceX Crew-1 astronauts for their 
successful arrival at the ISS.
