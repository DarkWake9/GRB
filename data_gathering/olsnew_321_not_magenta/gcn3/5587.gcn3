SUBJECT: GRB 060923: UKIRT nIR observations - candidate afterglow

We observed the field of GRB 060923 with UFTI on UKIRT, beginning
at 06:07 (UT), approximately 55 minutes post-burst.  We detect a
faint source in the K-band image at approximately:

 16 58 28.18  +12 21 38.9

This position (based on provisional astrometry) is only 4.6 arcsec
from the reported XRT position (Stamatikos et al. GCN 5583).
The source appears to have faded in another (shallower) K-band
observation made 30 mins later, and therefore is likely to be
the afterglow of this burst.

Further analysis is ongoing.
