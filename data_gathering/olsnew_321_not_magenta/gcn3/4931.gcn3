on behalf of the WIDGET collaboration report: 

"We have observed the error box of the Swift GRB 060323 (Vetere et
al., GCN 4904) with a very wide-field camera, WIDGET, located at
Akeno, Japan. WIDGET is continuously monitored the region with repeat
of unfiltered 5 seconds exposures between 750 seconds before and 82
seconds after the burst trigger. We have not found any optical
emission at the Swift XRT source position (Kennea et al., GCN
4909). The 1-sigma limiting magnitude of each frame derived by the
Tycho 2 catalog was around V=12.0 magnitude."
