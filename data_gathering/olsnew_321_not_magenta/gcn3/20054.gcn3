Masanori Ohno (Hiroshima Univ.), E. Bissaldi (Politecnico & INFN Bari), J.
E. McEnery (NASA/GSFC), M. Arimoto (Tokyo Tech) and G. Vianello (Stanford)
report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 17:03:07.04 on October, 15, 2016 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission
from GRB 161015A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (trigger 498243790 /
161015710).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be
RA, Dec = 269.15, 30.19 (J2000)
with an error radius of 0.21 deg (90 % containment, statistical error
only).
This was 50 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger and
triggered an autonomous repoint of the spacecraft.
The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate
that is spatially and temporally correlated with the trigger with high
significance.
The highest-energy photon is a 1.5 GeV event which is observed 72 seconds
after the GBM trigger.
A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.
The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Masanori Ohno (
ohno@hep01.hepl.hiroshima-u.ac.jp)


The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an
international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many
scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
