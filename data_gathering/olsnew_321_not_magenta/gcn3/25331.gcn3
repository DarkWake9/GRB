LIGO/Virgo S190814bv: GRAWITA TNG imaging of selected galaxies

P. D'Avanzo, A. Melandri  (INAF-OAB), L. Izzo (IAA/CSIC), M. Branchesi (GSSI), V. D'Elia (ASI-SSDC), 
G. Greco (Urbino Univ.), S. Piranomonte (INAF-OAR), A. Rossi (INAF-OAS), V. Testa (INAF-OAR), 
W. Boschin, A. Bragaglia, D. Carosati (INAF-TNG), A. J. Levan (Radboud Univ.), D. B. Malesani (DTU Space), 
D. A. Perley (LJMU), Lana Salmon (UCD) on behalf of GRAWITA and other collaborations report:


We observed the position of the 10 galaxies listed below, with the 3.6m Italian 
TNG telescope (Canary Islands, Spain), equipped with the DOLORES camera in 
imaging mode. These targets were selected from the list of probable host galaxies 
generated by the HOGWARTS code (https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie/), consistent 
with the 90% probability region of S190814bv (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and 
Virgo Collaboration, GCN Circ. 25324). Similar lists were coordinated with collaborating 
telescopes in La Palma as in Heintz et al. (GCN Circ. 25324) and Perley et al. (GCN Circ. 25328).

Each galaxy was observed for 2 minutes exposure in the SDSS r filter. Observations were 
carried out on 2019 Aug 15 between 02:13 and 02:54 UT. Conditions were affected by the nearby 
bright Moon and large airmass.

Visual inspection of the 10 fields does not reveal any new candidate compared with archival images 
from the Pan-STARRS survey.
