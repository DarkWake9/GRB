reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:


"The preliminary temporal and spectral analysis reported
in GCN 28843 refer to trigger 626247072 / 201105230,
detected by Fermi-GBM at 05:31:07.76 UT on 5 November 2020.
This event was also detected by the Swift/BAT
(Markwardt et al. 2020, GCN 28845).
The GBM on-ground location, also reported in GCN 28843,
is consistent with the Swift position.
