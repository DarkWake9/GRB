Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink, we report
further analysis of Swift-BAT Trigger #146227 (E. Rol, et al., GCN 3623).
The ground-analysis position is RA,Dec 338.607, 38.682 (J2000) with an
uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90%, stat+sys).  T90 is 69 +/-1 sec.
The burst had a slow rise and slow decay with two broad peaks centered
at T+12 and T+44 seconds.  Fitting a cutoff power law over the full interval
from T-14 to T+76 seconds, the photon index is 0.79  +/- 0.26, Epeak is
104 +29 -15 keV and the Norm at 1 keV is 0.34 +0.38 -.19  with a fluence
of 8.3 +1.3 -0.6 X 10^-6 erg/cm^2 in the 15-350 keV band (90% c.l.).
The peak flux in a 1-sec wide window starting at T+12.2 seconds
is 2.23 +/- 0.41 ph/cm^2/sec (15-350 keV).
