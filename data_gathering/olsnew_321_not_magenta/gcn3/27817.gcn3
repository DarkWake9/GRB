L. Izzo (DARK/NBI) reports:

We observed the field of GRB 200524A (Fermi-LAT detection: Dirirsa et al. GCN #27797, Fermi GBM detection: Pookalil et al., GCN #27809) with the IO:O camera mounted on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope located in La Palma, Spain. Observations started on May 25th at 01:08:27 UT (0.837 days after the GRB trigger) and we obtained a series of 5x60s images in the gri filters.

The afterglow (Ho et al., GCN #27799, Kumar et al., GCN #27800, Rumyantsev et al., GCN #27802, Sanwal et al., GCN #27803, Perley et al., GCN #27805, Kumar et al., GCN #27806, de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN #27807, Blazek et al., GCN #27810, Ogawa et al., GCN #27813, Zheng et al., GCN #27814) is detected in all the stacked images. We measure a preliminary AB magnitude for the afterglow of g = 21.67 +- 0.35 mag (t_mid = 0.839 d), r = 21.37 +- 0.20 mag (t_mid = 0.844 d), i = 21.34 +- 0.25 mag(t_mid = 0.849 d) calibrated against Pan-STARRS catalogue stars.
