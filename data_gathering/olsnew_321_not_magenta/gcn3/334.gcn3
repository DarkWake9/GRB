TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  334
SUBJECT: radio detection of X-ray/GRB transient

D. A. Frail (NRAO), S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) and C. H. Young 
(MSU, NRAO) report:

"On 1999 May 20.69 UT we carried out VLA observations at 4.8 GHz of
the fast X-ray transient detected by BeppoSAX (GCN 333). There is only
one radio source detected in the 3-arcminute error circle. Its
position is (equinox 2000) R.A.=8 36 0.7 (+/-0.1s), decl.=+51 17 8.4
(+/-1").  There is no source at this position in the 1.4 GHz NRAO VLA
Sky Survey taken in 1993 November. Further VLA observations are
underway to determine whether this source is related to the X-ray
transient.

This message is citeable."
