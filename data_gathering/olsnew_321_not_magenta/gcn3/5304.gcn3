Using the data set from T-119 to T+183 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060712 (trigger #218582)
(Cummings, et al., GCN Circ. 5301).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 184.065, +35.539 deg {12h 16m 15.7s, +35d 32' 21.6"} (J2000)
+- 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 9%.
 
The lightcurve for this weak source shows approximately 3 overlapping peaks
starting at T_zero and lasting unit ~T+35 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 26 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.6 to T+29.7 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum
is 1.64 +- 0.32.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+16.76 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.6 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
