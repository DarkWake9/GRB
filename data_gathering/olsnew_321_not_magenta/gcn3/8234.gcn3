At 15:53:35 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080915B (trigger=324805). The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 213.078, -11.473 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 14h 12m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = -11d 28' 23"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single FRED peak
structure with a duration of about 5 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~13,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to the Solar observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the 
BAT position until mid-December. There will thus be no XRT or 
UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. Ziaeepour (hz AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
