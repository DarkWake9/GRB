L. Rhodes, D. Williams (Oxford), R.P. Fender (Oxford/UCT), A.J. van der
Horst (GWU), A. Horesh (HUJI), K. Mooley (NRAO/Caltech) and P.A. Woudt
(UCT) report on behalf of the ThunderKAT collaboration:

“We observed the position of the GRB 181126A afterglow at 1.3 GHz with
the new MeerKAT radio telescope on November 28, from 3.55 to 4.72 UT,
i.e. 1.76 days after the burst (GCN 23453). We do not detect a radio source
at the position of the X-ray counterpart (GCN 23455). The rms noise in the
map around that position is 30 microJy per beam.

These observations were taken as part of the ThunderKAT Large Survey
Project, a 5-year program for observations of transients with MeerKAT.
We would like to thank the staff at the South African Radio Astronomy
Observatory (SARAO) for scheduling and obtaining these observations.”
