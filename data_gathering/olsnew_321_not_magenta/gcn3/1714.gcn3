A. Gros (CEA-Saclay) and N. Produit (ISDC) on behalf of the INTEGRAL 
Science Working Team report:

The systematic errors on the position of GRB021125 obtained from the 
IBIS/ISGRI
data have been significantly reduced to a radius of 2 arcmin.
The resulting new position of the 2 arcmin-radius circle center is
19h 47m 56s, 28° 23' 28" (2000).
This circle is fully contained in the previous
INTEGRAL error circle (GCN 1706) and partially overlaps the most recent 
IPN error box (GCN 1709).
