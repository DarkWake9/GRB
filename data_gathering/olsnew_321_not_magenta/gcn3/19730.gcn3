The long-duration GRB 160721A (Fermi-GBM trigger #490821662;
INTEGRAL-ACS trigger #7516) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (CGBM) at 19:20:58.54 on 21 July 2016.  The burst signal was
seen by all CGBM instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows two short spikes with a broad emission.
The short spikes are peaked at T+0 sec and T+1.8 sec with the durations
less than a second.  The underline broad emission ends around T+10 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 8.6 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda
CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
