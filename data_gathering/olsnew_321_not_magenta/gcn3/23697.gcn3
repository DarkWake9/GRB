Jonatan Selsing (DAWN/NBI and DAWN/DTU), A. de Ugarte Postigo
(HETH/IAA-CSIC and DARK/NBI), Kasper E. Heintz (Univ. of Iceland),
and S. Dyrbye (NOT), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 190114A (LaPorte et al., GCN
23677; Siegel et al., GCN 23678; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 23680:
Bolmer et al., GCN 23682: D'Avanzo et al., GCN 23683) with the 2.5-m
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC instrument.

We have carried out a three r-band imaging integrations each lasting
300s. The observations started in twilight on 2019.01.14 at 19:54:06 UT,
~16.5 hours after the BAT trigger. The afterglow is still well detected. 

Calibrating the photometric zeropoint against the Pan-STARRS catalog we
derive 

r = 21.24 +- 0.08 AB mag.

We do not detect any counterpart to the intervening system at z=2.6232
reported by de Ugarte Postigo et al. (GCN 23680) down to a 3-simga
limiting magnitude of r > 22.44.
