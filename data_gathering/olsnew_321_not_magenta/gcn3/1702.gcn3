TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1702
SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB021119 (annulus)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, report:


Ulysses and Konus-Wind observed this GRB at 46446 seconds.
As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately   20 seconds, 
a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6E-6 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of 
approximately  1E-6 erg/cm2 s over  .50 seconds.

We have triangulated it a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl(2000)=181.744, 35.203 degrees, whose radius is 41.845 +/-0.093
degrees (3 sigma).  

This annulus can be constrained and/or improved, but as this event
was not observed by Mars Odyssey, a small error box cannot be
obtained for it.
