W. Fong (University of Arizona) reports:

"We observed the field of GRB 160303A (Beardmore et al., GCN 19126) with
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) beginning on 2016 Mar 4.218 UT
(18.32 hr post-burst) at a mean frequency of 9.8 GHz. In 1 hour of
observations, we do not detect any radio source within or around the
enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 19132) or the optical afterglow
position (Butler et al., GCN 19131; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 19136) to
a 3-sigma limit of 15.2 microJy. We therefore place a 3-sigma limit of 15.2
microJy on the radio afterglow of GRB 160303A at 18.32 hr after the burst.

We thank the VLA staff for quickly executing these observations."
