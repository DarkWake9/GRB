The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 07:34:05 UT on 9 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190609A (trigger 581758450.25943 / 190609315).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 165.8, Dec = -50.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 03m, -50d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 30.0 degrees.
