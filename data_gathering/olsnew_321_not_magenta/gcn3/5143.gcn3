TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB060515: P200 NIR Observations

S. B. Cenko (Caltech), T. H. Jarrett (IPAC), and D. B. Fox (Penn State)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060515 (Cummings et al., GCN 5132) with the
Wide-Field Infrared Camera mounted on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telecope.
Observations consisted were taken in the Ks band at a mean time of 04:37
15 May 2006 UT (~ 2.15 hours after the burst).  High cirrus clouds
affected the limiting magnitude of our observations.

We find no new sources in the XRT (Page et al, GCN 5139) error circle to a
limiting magnitude of Ks > 16.0 (calculated with respect to several 2MASS
objects in the field).  In addition, we see no object at the location of
the possible TAROT afterglow (Klotz, Boer, and Atteia, GCN 5134) to the
same limiting magnitude.
