E. Berger, S. R. Kulkarni, and D. A. Frail report on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"On 2002, February 1.03 UT we used the VLA at 8.46 GHz to observe the
position of the peculiar Type Ib/c SN2002ap in M74 (IAUC 7810 and 7811).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 375+/-30 microJy within 1"
of the optical position of this supernova at coordinates (J2000):
RA=01:36:23.920, DEC=15:45:12.867, with an uncertainty of approximately 10
milliarcsec in both coordinates. The optical spectrum of this SN is
similar to that of SN1998bw, and there is some evidence that SN2002ap is a
younger and/or more energetic version of SN1998bw (IAUC 7810).  In view of
the peculiar properties of this object, the radio detection, and the
possible connection of SN 1998bw with GRB 980425, we urge further
observations at all wavelengths."
