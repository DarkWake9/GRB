SUBJECT: GRB 090814B: Swift-XRT detection of a possible afterglow.

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and W.H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC) report on
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The Swift-XRT observed the field of the INTEGRAL GRB 090814B (Beckmann
et al. GCN. Circ. 9795), gathering 900-s of data in the interval T0+9 ks
to T0+14 ks.

In the INTEGRAL error circle we find a single, uncatalogued X-ray source
at RA,Dec=64.7546, 60.5901 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 04h 19m 01.10s
Dec (J2000): +60d 35' 24.34"

with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The source has a count-rate of ~0.03 count/sec, but we are unable to
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The spectrum comprises only 24 photons, but it can be well modelled
with an absorbed power-law with photon index Gamma=0.8 (+/-1.3) and a
column density of 9.0 (+16.0, -5.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in excess of the
Galactic value if 3.6 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).

Swift will conduct a further 4-ks observation of this source today.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
