(PSU), M.C. Stroh (PSU), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P.A. Evans (U.
Leicester) and H.A. Krimm report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 130609B (Krimm  et al. GCN
Circ. 14841),  from 66 s to 46.7 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 1.4 ks in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Goad et al.
(GCN. Circ 14847).

The late-time light curve (from T0+5.4 ks) can be modelled with an
initial power-law decay with an index of alpha=1.42 (+0.14, -0.56),
followed by a break at T+13.6 ks to an alpha of 2.36 (+0.38, -0.22).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.840 (+/-0.029). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.40 (+0.08, -0.07) x 10^21 cm^-2,
in excess of the Galactic value of 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.01 (+/-0.10) and a
best-fitting absorption column of 1.28 (+0.26, -0.24) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 3.7 x 10^-11 (5.0 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.28 (+0.26, -0.24) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.4 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 7.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.01 (+/-0.10)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.36, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 8.4 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 3.1 x
10^-13 (4.1 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
