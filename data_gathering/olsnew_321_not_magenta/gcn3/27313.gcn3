on
behalf of the AstroSat LAXPC and CZTI collaboration report:

Analysis of AstroSat LAXPC and CZTI data showed the detection of a long 
GRB 2002010A.

The source was clearly detected in the 3-400 keV energy range. The light 
curve showed
multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2020-02-10 
08:03:40.00 UT. The
measured peak count rate above the background associated with the burst 
is 354 +/- 29 cts/s
in LAXPC10 and 197 +/- 21 in LAXPC20, with a total of 5524 +/- 143 cts 
in LAXPC10 and
3384 +/- 99 in LAXPC20. LAXPC20 has a nominal energy range of 3-100 keV 
but due to lower
gain in LAXPC10 the energy range is about 30-400 keV. The background 
subtracted light curve
with 1 sec time-bin in LAXPC detectors is available at the web-site:

The measured peak count rate associated with the burst in CZTI is 288 
+/- 29 cts/s above
the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 
6338 +/- 67 cts.
The local mean background count rate was 533 +/- 15 cts/s. Using 
cumulative rates, we
measure a T90 of 29.2 +/- 0.01 s. CZTI operates in the energy range of 
40-200 keV. It was
also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 
100-500 keV energy
range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb.

LAXPC is built by TIFR in collaboration with the Indian Space Research 
Organisation.
CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, 
including VSSC, ISAC,
IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, 
managed and
facilitated the project.
