Through intermittent clouds and in poor seeing conditions, we observed the
field of GRB 130122A (Lien, et al., GCN 14140) with the Reionization and
Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold
Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astron&#243;mico Nacional on Sierra
San Pedro M&#225;rtir.  Between 2013 Jan 23.30 to 2013 Jan 23.52 UTC (7.6
to 12.7 hours after the BAT trigger), we obtained approximately 45 minutes
of useful data in the r', i', Z, Y, and J bands.

In comparison with SDSS DR8 and 2MASS, we derive the following detection
and upper limits (3-sigma) in the AB magnitude system for a source
spatially coincident with the UVOT position (GCN 14140):

 r' >20.7
 i' 21.1 +/- 0.2
 Z  >20.3
 Y  >20.2
 J  >18.2

These magnitudes are not corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction
of the GRB.  Continued observations are planned.
