the Swift Team:

At 07:08:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120911A (trigger=533268).  Swift could not immediately slew
due to the Earth limb constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 357.961, +63.099 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 23h 51m 51s
   Dec(J2000) = +63d 05' 55"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex structure
with a duration of at least 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+51.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. K. Cannizzo (cannizzo AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
