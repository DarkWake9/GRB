WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on

behalf of the KAIT GRB team:


We continued observing the optical afterglow of GRB 210610B

(e.g. Page et al., GCN 30170; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 30204) with

the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at

Lick Observatory. A total of 30x60s images were obtained in the

clear (roughly R) filter. The optical afterglow was detected in the

coadd image with a mag of 20.0 +/- 0.2 at ~1.44 days after burst,

calibrated to the Pan-STARRS1 catalog.
