We observed 45 sqdeg covering the field of S170701ah (LIGO/Virgo, B.
Piotrzkowski
et al., GCN #24950, updated sky localization, B. Piotrzkowski et al., GCN
#24987) in r' band with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) equipped  with
Omegacam (1 sqdeg FOV) (Proposal ID ESO 0103.D-0070(A)).

Observations started at 08:08 UT on 2019-07-04 and ended at 10:27 on
2019-07-04. They were performed under  seeing conditions between 0.49” and
0.8”,  at an airmass between 1.95 and 1.27. Each pointing covering 1 sqdeg
was observed twice for a total exposure time of 80 seconds.
The observations, that cover ~70% of the localization probability region,
 were organized in group of 3x3 deg, the coordinates of the center of each
group are:

RA(J2000) Dec(J2000)
