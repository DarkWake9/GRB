On Feb. 22, 07:23:30 U.T. a very bright GRB, possibly the brightest ever
observed by BeppoSAX has been detected simultaneously by the GRBM and WFC1
aboard BeppoSAX.

Preliminary  coordinates from WFC are:

R.A.(2000)= 223.069
DEC.(2000)= 43.035

The error radius at this stage of analysis is 5'.

We are planning a BeppoSAX-NFI observation.
