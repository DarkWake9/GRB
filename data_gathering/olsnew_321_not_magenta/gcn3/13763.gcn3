B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf
of the Swift Team:

At 23:55:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120913B (trigger=533613).  Swift did not slew because of the
Sun observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 213.644, -14.535 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 14m 35s
   Dec(J2000) = -14d 32' 04"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several peaks
with a total duration of about 70 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 20:57 UT on 2012 December 14. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. A. Helder (helder AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
