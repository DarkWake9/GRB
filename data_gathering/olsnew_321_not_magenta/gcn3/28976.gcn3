We observed the field of the Fermi/GBM likely long GRB 201201A (Fermi GBM Team,
GCN Circ. 28972) with the DDOTI wide-field imager at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Martir (http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx)
from 2020-12-01 02:56 UTC to 03:39 UTC (from 4.4 to 47.2 minutes after the
trigger).

We observed a region covering 20.4 degrees in RA and 20.4 degrees in declination
(about 416 square degrees) centered on 19:23:21.60 +16:54:36.0 (J2000). We
obtained between 120 and 360 seconds of exposure in the w filter. We calibrated
our images against the APASS catalog. Our 10-sigma limiting magnitudes vary from
w = 16.4 to 18.2.

Compared to the USNO-B1, Pan-STARRS DR1, and APASS DR10 catalogs, we detect no
uncataloged sources to our 10-sigma limit.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in San Pedro Martir.
