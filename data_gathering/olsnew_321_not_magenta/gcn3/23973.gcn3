B. Sbarufatti (PSU) and A. Tohuvavohu (PSU) report on behalf of the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 01:14:36 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 190320A (trigger=893808).  Swift did not slew immediately 
due to an observing constraint. The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 117.811, -45.890 which is 
 RA(J2000) = 07h 51m 15s
 Dec(J2000) = -45d 53' 22"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  There is a data gap from ~T+10 s to ~T+100 s,
and the available data show no significant structure. However, 
since the image significance is 7.63 sigma, and the trigger is 
temporally (within ~ 20 sec) coincident with the Fermi/GBM event 
(trignum=574737261), we believe this is likely to be a real GRB. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+44.3
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J.D. Gropp (jdg44 AT psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
