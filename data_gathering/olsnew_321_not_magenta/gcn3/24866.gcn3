Alexis Coleiro (APC) and Damien Dornic (CPPM) report on behalf of the ANTARES Collaboration:
Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported single track-like event IceCube-190619A (GCN 24854). The reconstructed origin was 19 degrees below the horizon for ANTARES. 

No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded within 3 degrees of the IceCube event coordinates during a +/- 1h time-window centered on the IceCube event time, and over which the potential source remained visible all time. A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (45% visibility). This leads to a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 13 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 3.9 TeV - 3.9 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 33 GeV.cm^-2 (720 GeV - 320 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. 

ANTARES is the largest neutrino detector installed in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is about 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky.
