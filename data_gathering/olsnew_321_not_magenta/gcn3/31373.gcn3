We observed the field of GRB 220101A (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN Circ. 31347; Arimoto et al., GCN Circ. 31350; Ursi et al., GCN Circ. 31354; 
Lesage & Meegan, GCN Circ. 31360) with the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope equipped with the near-infrared camera NICS. A series of images 
were obtained with the J, H, K filters on 2022-01-02 from 20:21:15 UT to 21:57:47 UT (i.e. at a mid time of about 1.67 days after the burst). 

A source is clearly detected in all bands at the optical and mm afterglow position (Kuin & Tohuvavohu, GCN Circ. 31351; Laskar, GCN Circ. 31372). 
From preliminary photometry we derive the following magnitude:

J = 18.29 +/- 0.05

(Vega; calibrated against the 2MASS catalogue).

We report the presence of a possibly extended source which lies about 1.8‚Äù North with respect to the NIR GRB afterglow. For this source we derive J ~ 20 mag (Vega). 
We note that this source is present in the CatWISE2020 catalogue (Marocco et al., 2021, ApJSS, 253, 22; arXiv:2012.13084).
