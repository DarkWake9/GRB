  "We have obtained deep R-band imaging of the field of the GRB
   050315 optical afterglow (GCN Circ. 3100) with the 1.54m Danish
   telescope on La Silla. The observations were carried out during
   five nights (8, 9, 11, 12 & 14 April 2005) with a total exposure
   time of ~7 hours. In the stacked image, which has a 3 sigma
   limiting magnitude of 24.2, an object is detected within an arcsec
   of the afterglow position. This object, which we tentatively
   identify as the GRB 050315 host galaxy, shows an elongated shape
   in the E-W direction.

   The magnitude of the potential host galaxy is R=23.9+/-0.2. The
   photometric calibration is based on observations of Landolt fields.

   Further sub-arsecond deep observations are necessary to clarify
   the nature of this object."
