report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At 19:49:03.50 on July, 09, 2016 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy

emission from GRB 160709A, which was also detected

by Fermi-GBM (trigger 489786546 / 160709826).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be

RA, Dec = 236.110, -28.500 (J2000)

with an error radius of 0.18 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only).

This was 48 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger.

The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate

that is spatially and temporally correlated with the trigger with high
significance.

More than 30 photons above 100 MeV are observed within 100 seconds,

with the highest-energy photons being 1 GeV events observed 2 seconds

after the GBM trigger and consistent with the GBM brightest emission
episode.

A Swift ToO has been requested for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Sylvain Guiriec (
sylvain.guiriec@nasa.gov).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV

to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA

and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy,
Japan and Sweden.
