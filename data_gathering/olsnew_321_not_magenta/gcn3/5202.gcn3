TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5202
SUBJECT: GRB 060526: Tautenburg Second Epoch Observations
DATE:    06/06/03 01:53:49 GMT
FROM:    Alexander Kann at TLS Tautenburg  <kann@tls-tautenburg.de>

D. A. Kann and U. Laux (Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg) report:

We observed the location of the afterglow of GRB 060526 (Campana et al., 
GCN 5162) with the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope. Observing 
conditions were mediocre. While it was clear, transparency was low and sky 
background was high due to moonlight and light pollution.

We obtained 20 x 600 sec exposures for a total integration time of 12000 
seconds. Observations commenced on June 2, 21:04:17 UT and ended June 3, 
00:55:07 UT. Midexposure time is June 2.9546, which is 7.2682 days after 
the burst.

We do not detect the optical afterglow. Using the USNO calibration star 
from Khamitov et al., GCN 5177, we derive the following 2 sigma limiting 
magnitude:

t-t_0	Rc limit
7.2682	> 23.5

As Khamitov et al. (GCN 5193) already found a similar magnitude of the 
afterglow two days earlier, this limit can only constrain that no further 
very bright flares have occured.

No further observations are planned.
