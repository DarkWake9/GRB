I. Monageng (UCT/SAAO), A.J. van der Horst (GWU), P.A. Woudt (UCT)
and M. Bottcher (NWU) report on behalf of a large collaboration:

"We observed the position of the GRB 190829A afterglow at 1.3 GHz with
the MeerKAT radio telescope on September 2, from 2:00 to 3:19 UT, i.e.
3.3 days after the burst (GCN 25551, 25552).
We detect a radio source with a flux density of 842 +/- 42 microJy at
the position of the optical counterpart (GCN 25552, 25555).

We would like to thank the staff at the South African Radio Astronomy
Observatory for scheduling and obtaining these DDT observations.‚Äù
