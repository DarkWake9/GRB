Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,

we report further analysis of BAT GRB 220518A (trigger #1107050)

(Gropp et al., GCN 32060).  The BAT ground-calculated position is

RA, Dec = 55.340, -47.593 deg which is 

   RA(J2000)  =  03h 41m 21.6s 

   Dec(J2000) = -47d 35' 36.3" 

with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).

The partial coding was 51%.

 

The light curve has a peak at the trigger time and potential precursor 

emission occuring slightly before the BAT trigger time. 

T90 (15-350 keV) is 12.29 +- 3.07 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-8.36 to T+7.58 sec is best fit by a simple

power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is

1.71 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.7 +- 0.8 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.

The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.07 sec in the 15-150 keV band

is 1.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence

level.
