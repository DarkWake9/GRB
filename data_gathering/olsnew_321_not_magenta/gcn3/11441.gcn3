GRB 101130A (localized by IPN: Hurley et al., GCN 11437)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=34766.178s UT (09:39:26.178)

The burst light curve starts with a short (~1.5 s) pulse,
followed by a weaker pulse at ~T0+55 s (with a duration of ~6 s).
The emission is seen up to ~1 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB101130_T34766/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.1(+1.1/-1.0)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux measured from T0-0.048s
of 2.8(+0.8/-0.7)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+65.792 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range by a simple power law model
with the index = -1.85 (-0.3, +0.35), chi2 = 44/48 dof.

The spectrum of the initial short pulse
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.6 (-0.6, +0.9),
and Ep = 190(-55, +135) keV, chi2 = 26/18 dof.

The spectrum of the second pulse
(measured from T0+57.600 to T0+65.792 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 1 MeV range by a simple power law model
with the index = -2.1 (-0.5, +0.7), chi2 = 49/48 dof.
