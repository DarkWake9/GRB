of the Swift Team:

At 21:05:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140311A (trigger=591390).  Swift could not immediately
slew to the burst due to the Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 209.301, +0.612 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 57m 12s
   Dec(J2000) = +00d 36' 41"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  This is an image trigger and we cannot 
say much about the light curve. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+50.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. L. Racusin (judith.racusin AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
