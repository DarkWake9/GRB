"We have monitored the afterglow of XRF 030723 (Prigozhin et al. GCN #2313; 
Fox et al. GCN #2323; Butler et al. GCN #2328) with the ESO VLT. Between 
Aug 3.2 UT and Aug 6.3 2003 UT the optical afterglow brightened by 1.0 mag 
to R ~ 24.3. If this is due to the emergence of a supernova it would 
strengthen the link between GRBs and XRFs. It would also indicate a fast rise 
for the supernova and a relatively low redshift for XRF 030723, z < 1, 
consistent with the earlier spectroscopic constraints (Fynbo et al. 
GCN #2327). Alternatively, we may be seeing a rebrightening due to late 
energy injection (refreshed shock). Continued spectroscopic and photometric 
monitoring is planned.
