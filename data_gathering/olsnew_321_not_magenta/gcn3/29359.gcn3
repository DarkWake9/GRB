The HAWC collaboration reports:

On 2021/01/25, the All-sky Flare Monitor of the HAWC observatory detected a
transient event located at:

RA (J2000): 359.21[deg]
Dec (J2000): 39.29[deg]
Position uncertainty (68% containment): 0.15[deg]

The false alarm rate is 10.5 yr^-1.
The pre-trial significance is 5.56 sigma, with an integrated flux of
(4.6±0.9)e-11 cm^-2s^-1 (> 1 TeV) for a power-law with index of -3.0.
The time period is between 2021/01/24 19:02:48-2021/01/25 01:15:52 UTC
(Total of 6.22 hr)

The monitor also searched in previous days and found that for 2 transits.
The false alarm rate is  6.42 yr^-1.
The pre-trial significance of 5.64 sigma, with an integrated flux of
(3.4±0.7)e-11 cm^-2s^-1 (> 1 TeV).
The time period is between 2021/01/23 19:06:23-2021/01/25 01:15:31 UTC
(Total of 12.44 hr)

There are 3 known gamma-ray sources nearby: 3FHL J2358.5+3829 (0.86 deg),
3FGL J2358.5+3827 (0.90 deg), and 3FGL J2358.9+3926 (0.44 deg).

HAWC will keep monitoring the position.
Observations around the position are encouraged.
