J. Stanzin (IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB190604B reported by K. L. Page et al., GCN
24742 at 2019-06-04 and 20:03:18.675 UT with the 0.7m GROWTH-India
telescope. We took 2 exposures of 600 seconds each in r filter. No source
was found within an uncertainty region of 3.6 arcseconds to RA(J2000) = 19h
50m 09.13s, Dec(J2000) = -32d 58' 35.9" (K. L. Page et al.,GCN 24742).

We obtained the following upper limits:

------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD(Start)| Exposure(sec) | Filter | lim_Mag |

------------------------------------------------------------------

2458639.335 | 600 | r | 20.33|

2458639.342 | 600 | r | 19.93|
