SUBJECT: GRB 080207: TAROT Calern observatory optical observations

FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 080207 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 302728) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

Although the notice was received 100s after the trigger,
the observations started 1075s later
because the field was not risen at Calern during the burst.
First images are two low in elevation.
Stars become detectable on images ~1500s after the trigger.
Weather conditions were excellents.

The date of trigger : t0 = 2008-02-07T21:30:21
No afterglow was found at position delivered by
Beardmore et al. (GCNC 7265):

t0+1563s to t0+1653s : R > 14.3 (elevation 2.5°)
t0+1670s to t0+1760s : R > 14.9 (elevation 2.8°)
t0+3388s to t0+3568s : R > 16.2 (elevation 8°)
t0+3388s to t0+7526s : R > 19.0 (elevation 20°)

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
