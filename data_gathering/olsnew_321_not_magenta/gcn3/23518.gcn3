T. Laskar (University of Bath), E. Berger (Harvard), R. Chornock (Ohio
University), W. Fong (Northwestern), R. Margutti (Northwestern), C. G.
Mundell (University of Bath), and P. Schady (University of Bath) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed GRB 181201A (Mereghetti et al. GCN 23469) with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) starting at 0.9 d after the
burst at 90 GHz. Preliminary analysis reveals a bright (S/N > 150), fading
mm counterpart at a location consistent with the X-ray position (Page et
al. GCN 23474) and optical position (Podesta et al., GCN 23470; Lipunov et
al., GCN 23476, GCN 23484; Siegel & Cannizzo, GCN 23499). Follow-up
observations are planned.

We thank the JAO staff, AoD, and the ALMA team for their help with these
observations."
