report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 14:00:58.42 UT on 6 August 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 160806A (trigger 492184862 / 160806584)
which was also detected by the Konus-Wind
(Kozlova et al., GCN 19785) and located by the Interplanetary Network
(Hurley et al., GCN 19784). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with
the IPN position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 112
degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of a single symmetric pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 1.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+2 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.58 +/- 0.14 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 142 +/- 11 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.35 +/- 0.07)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 64 ms peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.13 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 17.6 +/- 2.0 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak= 122 +/- 15 keV,
alpha = -0.41 +/- 0.20 and beta = -2.64 +/- 0.38.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
