We observed the field of GRB 130612A (Racusin, et al., GCN Circular
14874) with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/06 12.16 to
2013/06 12.20 UTC (0.40 to 1.31 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining
a total of 0.71 hours exposure in the r' and i' bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with
USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we obtain the following detections:

r'	21.23 ± 0.07
i'	21.05 ± 0.06

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The position of the source is consistent with the UVOT afterglow
position Racusin, et al., GCN Circular 14874). The afterglow appears to
have faded considerably since the earlier observations reported by
Melandri et al. (GCN Circular 14875), and Jakobsson et al. (GCN Circular
14878).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
