report:

"Following the detection by SWIFT of the short GRB 060801
(Racusin et al. GCNC 5378, Sato et al. GCN 5381), we have
taken R-band frames at the 2.0m Hanle telescope in India
(+HFOSC) starting on Aug 1.75 UT. Additional BVR-band frames
have been taken with the auxiliary port camera at the 3.5m
telescope at the German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory in
south Spain, starting on Aug 1.935 UT. Near the  position of
the X-ray afterglow (Racusin et al. GCN 5382), we detect two
faint optical sources in the R-band images:

source A: 14 12 01.8  +16 59 00.5

source B: 14 12 01.3 +16 58 54.0

with 1" accuracy (for the time being).

source A is at the edge of the XRT error box and brighter than
source B and it seems to be constant in brightness over the time
interval of our observations. Source B is consistent with the
XRT error box and there is marginal evidence that source B has
declined in brightness, with R = 22.5 +/- 0.5 (preliminary) in the
3.5m CAHA images. Further analysis is in progress."
