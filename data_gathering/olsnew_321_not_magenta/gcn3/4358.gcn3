report:

"We have imaged a 7' x 7' region containing the INTEGRAL error box for GRB 051211B
(Mereghetti et al. GCNC 4327) with the 1.5-m OSN telescope at the Observatorio
de Sierra Nevada, starting on Dec 11.94 UT (i.e. 25 min after the GRB).
A comparison image has been taken on Dec. 15.86 UT. At the position
of the X-ray afterglow detected by Swift/XRT (La Parola et al. GCN 4338)
we detect one source that has decreased significantly in brightness
in our I-band images. Coordinates yield:  RA(2000) =  23:02:41.57,Dec(2000) =
+55:04:51.5 (+/-0.4"). This is the likely optical afterglow to GRB 051211B.
Images are posted at http://www.iaa.es/~deugarte/GRBs/051211B/GRB051211B.gif .
An underlying object seems to be present on the DDS-2 (infrared) which may be
a bright host galaxy, detected also on our late I-band image.
Further observations are encouraged."
