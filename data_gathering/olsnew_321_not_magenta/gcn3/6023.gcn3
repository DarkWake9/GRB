T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team report:

The short hard GRB 070124 localized by the IPN (Hurley et al.,
GCN 6022), triggered Konus-Wind at T0=31311.621 s UT (08:41:51.621).

As observed by Konus-Wind it had a duration of ~0.9 s,
a fluence of 5.20(-4.09, +0.71)x10^-6 erg/cm2,
and the 16-ms peak flux measured from T0+0.720 s
1.12(-0.94, +0.37)x10^-5  erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 3 MeV energy range).
There is a hint of a weak tail seen up to several tens of seconds
after the trigger.

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+8.448 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 3 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.93(-0.32, +0.24)
and Ep = 994 (-429, +1237) keV (chi2 = 59/68 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
