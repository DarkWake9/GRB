report:

The error circle of GRB 010214 (Gandolfi et al., GCN #933) was imaged in R 
and I on February 15, 0:55 UT - 3:49 UT (about 16 - 19 hrs after the burst), 
using the Tautenburg Schmidt telescope equipped with the Schmidt focus CCD 
camera (fov 35 x 35 arcmin). 

A visual comparison of the combined R-band frames with the DSS2 red and the IR 
sky survey does not reveal any afterglow candidate brighter than about R=20. 
(The DSS IR sky survey excludes a promising candidate at RA, DEC (J2000) = 
17:40:55.0, 48:30:51 +/- 1 arcsec which seems to have no counterpart on 
the DSS2 red survey; these coordinates are based on the DSS2 red fits file.)

This message is quotable.
