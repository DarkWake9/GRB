We observed the field of GRB 201017A detected by Swift
(D'Ai et al., GCN Circ. 28666) with the iTelescope.Net
(http://www.itelescope.net) T5 (Takahashi Epsilon 250mm) telescope
located at the New Mexico Skies Observatory (NM, USA).
10 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the Red filter
starting from October 17 on 10:06:37 (UT) about 20.1 min. after
the trigger and stopped on 10:20:44 (UT).

We do not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual
images and the stacked image at the XRT position
(Goad et al., GCN Circ. 28671).  The estimated five sigma
upper limit of the combined image (total exposure of 600 sec)
is ~17.3 using the USNO-B1 catalog.
