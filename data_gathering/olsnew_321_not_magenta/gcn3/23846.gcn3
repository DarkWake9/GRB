GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 190203A (Lien , et al., GCN  23845)   with 
Zeiss-1000 1-m telescope of Koshka Observatory starting on Feb. 03  (UT) 
16:01:10 in  R-filter under not optimal weather conditions.   We do not 
detect the optical afterglow candidate (Lien , et al., GCN  23830). 
Preliminary photometry of the combined of first 4 images of 4*180 
seconds started on 2019-02-03 16:01:10 is R=19.5. Observation is continuing.

The photometry is based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.
