The AMI Large Array robotically triggered on the Swift alert for GRB 
170626A (Marshall et al., GCN 21264) as part of the 4pisky program, and 
subsequent follow up observations were obtained up to 10 days 
post-burst. Our observations at 15 GHz on 2016 Jun 26.51, Jun 28.76, Jun 
29.67 and Jul 04.66 (UT) do not reveal any radio source at the XRT 
location (Cholden-Brown et al., GCN 21267), with 3sigma upper limits of 
120 uJy, 138 uJy, 84 uJy and 132 uJy respectively.

We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations. The AMI-GRB 
database is a log of all GRB follow up observations with the AMI, and is 
available at http://4pisky.org/ami-grb/.
