The bright GRB 171216B (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger #7972; Hurley et al.
GCN circ. 22263) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) at
14:25:47.14 on 16 December 2017.  The burst signal was seen by the all instruments.

The light curve of the SGM shows several short peaks. The emission starts
at T0, peaks at T+3 sec and ends at T+5 sec.  The T90 duration measured
by the SGM data is 3.5 +- 0.4 sec (40-1000 keV).

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation
Center located at the Waseda University.
