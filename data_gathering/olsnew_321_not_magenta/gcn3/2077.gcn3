Institute of Uzbekistam Academy of Science), A.Pozanenko (IKI), V.Rumyantsev
(on behalf of CrAO GRB team), G.Beskin (SAO) report:


We have observed the OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985) of GRB030329
with  1.5m telescope of  High-altitude Observatory at Mt.Maidanak.  The
telescope is equipped   with  CCD SITe (2000x800). The observations were
carried out under good seeing conditions (1".0). Several BRI Bessel images
were obtained in April, 1. Based on star filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN
2023)  we estimate the OT magnitude:
