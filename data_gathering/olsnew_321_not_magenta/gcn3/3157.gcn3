The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began settled observations 
of the field of GRB 050331 (Angelini et al; GCN 3155) at 17:14:09 UT, 135s 
after the BAT trigger.  The first data taken after spacecraft settling was 
a 100s V image, sent directly to the ground through the TDRSS system, with 
pixel binning of 8x8 to reduce telemetry. Binned pixel sizes are 4x4 arcsec 
and the field of view is 5.3x5.3 arcmin. An extremely bright source, 
consistent with the XRT position, is found in the image. A magnitude can 
not be determined at this time due to saturation of the detector (13.0 mag).
