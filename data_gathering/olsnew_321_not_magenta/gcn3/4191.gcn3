TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4191
SUBJECT: GRB 051105B (INTEGRAL 2701): Optical observation
DATE:    05/11/05 13:19:05 GMT
FROM:    Kenzo Kinugasa at Gunma Astro. Obs/Japan  <kinugasa@astron.pref.gunma.jp>

K. Kinugasa (Gunma Astronomical Observatory) and K. Torii (Osaka U.) report:

 The error region of the INTEGRAL trigger #2701 was imaged by the
robotic 0.25m GETS telescope in the Gunma Astronomical Observatory.
Unfiltered imaging started at 11:14:11 UT (304 s after the trigger)
and 30 s integration was repeated.

Preliminary analysis does not show a new object within the refined
2'.82 radius error region (Seq_Num 1) and the following upper limits
are derived.

------------------------------------------
StartUT  Limit  Nframes
------------------------------------------
11:14:11 >11.2  1
11:28:40 >15.0  21
------------------------------------------

We note a bright (9th magnitude) star, SAO 215170, within the INTEGRAL
error circle.
