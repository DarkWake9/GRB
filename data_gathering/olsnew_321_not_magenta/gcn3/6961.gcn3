The B,V,R band observations for GRB 071021 field with Lulin 1-m
telescope started at 1.38 hours after the burst. No source was found
at XRT position (Sakamoto et al.; GCN 6958) and optical candidate
position (Guidorzi et al.; GCN 6959) in our combined images. The
R-band limiting magnitude, compared with several USNOB stars, is about
20.4 at 1.87 hours after the burst . This result suggests that the
fading optical source reported by Guidorzi et al. (GCN 6959) is the
optical afterglow of GRB 071021.
