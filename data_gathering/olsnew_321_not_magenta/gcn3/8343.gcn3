E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 081008 (Swift trigger 331093). The first image was at 
19:58:51.3 UT, 41.9 s after the burst (8.3 s after the GCN notice time). 
The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 
14.5 magnitude, brightening source with coordinates:

      18:39:50.0      -57:25:52.0    (J2000), with positional 
uncertainty of 1" or better

This source is not visible in DSS (second epoch), 2MASS or the MPChecker 
database.
