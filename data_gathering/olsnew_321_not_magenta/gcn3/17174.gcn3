K.L. Page, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and B.P. Gompertz (U. Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 152 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT images, we find an
astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and
matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec =
250.87617, 31.75045 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  16 43 30.28
Dec (J2000): +31 45 01.6

with an uncertainty of 2.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
