A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up  collaboration:

We observed the Swift GRB 151027A  (Maselli  et al., GCN 18478) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) on several epochs.   We 
obtained
images in R-filter  on Oct., 27-- Nov., 1 .  The afterglow (Maselli et al., 
GCN 18478; Zheng and  Filippenko, GCN 18479) is clearly detected in each 
epoch. Coordinates of the afterglow are (J2000) 18 09 56.66 +61 21 13.0 with 
uncertainties of 0.3 arcsec in each coordinate. We also detected the 
USNO-B1.0 source mentioned in GCN 18510 (Dichiara et al.) in a position 
(J2000) 18 09 56.44 +61 21 10.8 with uncertainties of 0.3 arcsec in each 
coordinate.

Preliminary photometry of the afterglow  on October-29 -- November, 1 is 
following

The photometry is based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars
USNO-B.1_id R2
1513-0237223 16.66
1513-0237170 15.58
1513-0237251 16.81
1513-0237270 16.78

Late time photometry could be influenced by the nearby USNO-B1.0 source.
