S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC/CRESST), P. A. Evans (U Leicester),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and B. Sbarufatti (PSU) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 07:07:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 210527A (trigger=1051453).  Swift did not slew immediately 
due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 172.355, +31.618 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 11h 29m 25s
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 37' 06"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is normal for an image trigger, the BAT 
light curve does not show any significant structure. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+49.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is S. Laha (sib.laha AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)
