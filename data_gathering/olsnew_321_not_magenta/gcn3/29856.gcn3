Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210419C (trigger #1044236)
(Moss et al., GCN Circ. 29834).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 212.969, 36.011 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 11m 52.6s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 00' 40.5"
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 72%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~70 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 73.00 +- 16.40 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+16.00 to T+102.00 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.50 +- 0.27.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.1 +- 1.2 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+48.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
