report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 21:15:32 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080411 (trigger=309010).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 38.018, -71.342 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 32m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -71d 20' 30"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The TDRSS BAT lightcurve shows the burst
starting with a fast rise from background to ~13,000 counts/sec in
approximately 0.5 sec.  There are several peaks after that with the
fourth peak (T+19 sec) at 75,000 cnts/sec.  There are several more peaks 
after that lasting out to at least T+70 sec. 

The XRT began observing the source at 21:16:42 UT (71 s after the 
trigger).  The XRT centroided on something very bright. 
We have lost most of our prompt diagnostic messages
because the spacecraft switched from TDRSS telemetry
to Malindi telemetry shortly after the burst, and our
prompt image does not include the source.  However,
the information within the header indicates that the
source is located near the center of the XRT field
of view, and is therefore probably real.  If real,
the position is 
GRB_RA:           37.9860d {+02h 31m 56.6s} (J2000),
GRB_DEC:         -71.3021d {-71d 18' 07.5"} (J2000),

with an uncertainty of 4.3 arcseconds (90% confidence 
radius), and the flux during this image was approximately
4.4e-7 cgs (~ 10 Crabs) in the 0.1 s image.  The XRT 
position is 148 arcseconds from the BAT position. 

No UVOT data for this burst are currently available. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is F. E. Marshall (marshall AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
