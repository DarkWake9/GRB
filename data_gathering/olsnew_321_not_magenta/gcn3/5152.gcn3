P. Goldoni report on behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 060522 (Fox et al., GCN 5150) with the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile) under  
mediocre weather conditions. A first set of observations was  
performed automatically in the near infrared (J, H, K, z bands)  
starting on May 22.2306 UT (about 3.3 hours after the burst). Then,  
we took a set of 20x100s H band images starting on May 22.2785 UT  
(about 4.5 hours the burst).

Preliminary analysis of both the datasets does not show any new  
source down to H = 16.5 and H=17.0 (3-sigma upper limits)  
respectively, at the position of the candidate optical afterglow  
reported by Fox et al. (GCN 5150) and D'Avanzo et al. (GCN 5151).
