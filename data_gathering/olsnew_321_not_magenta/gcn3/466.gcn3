TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  466
SUBJECT: Lowell/Perkins observation of GRB 991216
DATE:    99/12/17 04:55:02 GMT
FROM:    John Mattox at Boston U  <mattox@bu.edu>

I began observing GRB 991216 at 02:46:09 on 12/17 UT with the 1.8m
Perkins Telescope at Lowell Observatory. Will initially cover the 
region indicated by the RXTE/PCA scan - dRA=0.04 deg, dDEC=0.2 deg 
(Takeshima, Markwardt, Marshall, Giblin, & Kippen, GCN Notice, 12/16/99)
with a series of 5'x5' frames covering this DEC range with 200s 
exposures and an Rc filter. I am prepared to do UBVRI photometry
until 11:00 UT if the optical transient can be localized.
