During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by
a bright short burst (trig# 79763559) at 2021-07-12T04:32:39.600 UTC (T0),
Its alert data was promptly downlinked to the ground through the short
message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). The time latency
of the first BeiDou message relative to the trigger time is about 1 minute.

According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 20-100 keV, this burst mainly
consists of a single pulse with a duration about 50 ms. The location is consistent
with SGR J1935+2154 within the error.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
