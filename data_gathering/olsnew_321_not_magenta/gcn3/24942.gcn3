report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO-Virgo GW event S190630ag at T0 = 2019-06-30 18:52:05.180
UTC a preliminary analysis of the AGILE exposure at T0 shows that
the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) exposure covered less than 20%
of the 90% c.l. localization region (LR)  (due to Earth occultation
and Solar Panel constraints).

We performed an analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV
-10 GeV over time intervals before and after T0, where good exposure of
the S190630ag 90% c.l. LR was available.

No candidate gamma-ray transient was detected.

The following preliminary GRID values of 3-sigma upper limit (UL) are obtained:

from 5.9e-08 to 5.5e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1, with exposure of about 42% of the LR
over the time interval ( T0 -200s ; T0 -100s ).

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
