I.A. Smith (Rice U.), D.A. Perley (LJMU), and N.R. Tanvir 
(U. of Leicester) report:

We observed the location of GRB 190613B (D'Ai et al., GCN 
Circ. 24807) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera 
on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started 
at 11:40 UT on 2019-06-13, corresponding to 53 minutes after 
the burst trigger.  Exposures totaling 1.0 hours were made in 
very good weather conditions.  No source was detected, with 
the RMS background noise being 1.8 mJy/beam at 850 microns and 
21.3 mJy/beam at 450 microns.

We thank Kevin Silva, Jan Wouterloot, Koji Sugitani, and the 
JCMT staff for the prompt support of these observations that 
were taken under project M19AP044.
