Using the data set from T-239 to T+1390 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 080623 (trigger #315080)
(Ukwatta, et al., GCN Circ. 7894).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 237.667, -62.044 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 50m 40.1s 
   Dec(J2000) = -62d 02' 36.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 33%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows four overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-1 sec and ending at ~T+18 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 15.2 +- 5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.7 to T+16.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.35 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+7.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.0 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
