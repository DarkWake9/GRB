Howard E. Bond (Space Telescope Science Institute) reports:

The SXC error circle of XRF 030723 (HETE Burst H2777) was imaged with the
SMARTS Consortium 1.3m reflector at Cerro Tololo on 2003 July 24.080, 24.173,
and 24.281.  The 6'x6' CCD field was centered at RA= 21h 49m 27.4s, Dec= -27d
42' 01" (J2000), and R-band exposures of 3x300 sec were taken at each epoch.

Visual inspection of the images shows no new sources compared to the
second-epoch Digitized Sky Survey red images, nor any obviously variable fainter
objects.
