report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

We have analyzed the UVOT data for GRB 050714B
(Levan et al., GCN 3613; Tueller et al., GCN 3615)
taken 195 to 41743 seconds (approximately 12 hours)
after the trigger.  We detect a faint extended source
in a summed ultraviolet image with a total exposure time
of 8936 seconds located at RA = 11:18:48.26, Dec = -15.:32:50.87.
This location is within the refined XRT error circle reported
by Page et al. (GCN 3618).  At this time, we cannot determine
if this source is fading.  We note that this source position is
consistent with the position of one of the faint sources
(source B) detected in the VLT-FORS1 R-band  observations
reported by Covino et al. (GCN 3616).
