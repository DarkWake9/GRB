SUBJECT: GRB 080503: Optical afterglow candidate and LRIS spectroscopy of the short burst

D. A. Perley (UC Berkeley), D. Lai, C. Rockosi (UCSC/Lick), and J. S. 
Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

After the GRB alert we slewed to the position with the Keck I telescope, 
equipped with LRIS.  We detect a possible new source at a position 
consistent with the XRT position in the LRIS guider camera near the 
detection limit of the guider (~20-21st mag).  Spectroscopic 
observations began at ~13:01 UT.  Results will be reported in 
forthcoming circulars.
