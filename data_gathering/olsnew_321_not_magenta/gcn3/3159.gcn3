TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3159
SUBJECT: GRB050331: No Afterglow Detected
DATE:    05/03/31 20:47:13 GMT
FROM:    Aaron Price at AAVSO  <aaronp@aavso.org>

 B. Monard and A. Price report on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy Network on 
optical observations of the field of GRB050331 (GCN#3156 Palmer et al.).

 A field centered on the coordinates of the XRT position in GCN #3155 (Burrows et al.) was
observed at midpoint time of 19:03 UT and compared with the DSS/POSS red plate. The CCD
was unfiltered but with a red zeropoint response.

 No new source was identified down to a limiting magnitude (SNR=3) of 20. 

 Full details on the report is below along with a link to the FITS image:
