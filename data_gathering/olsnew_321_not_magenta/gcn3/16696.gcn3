Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright, fading X-ray
source with an enhanced position: RA,Dec = 127.2646, 58.1901
(degrees) which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) = 08 29 03.51
DEC (J2000.0) = +58 11 24.4

with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment).
This location is 16.8 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, inside the BAT
error circle.
