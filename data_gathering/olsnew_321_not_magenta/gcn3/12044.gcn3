Julie McEnery (NASA/GSFC), Johan Bregeon (INFN Pisa) and
Dan Kocevski (SLAC)  report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT collaboration.

The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detected emission from GRB
110529A also detected by GBM (trigger 328322924) at 00:48:42.87 UT
on May 29, 2011.

The GBM location was inside the LAT field of view at an angle of
~30 degrees to the LAT boresight; no significant excess is seen
using standard analysis procedures.

Using a non-standard data selection, over 30 counts above background
were detected within a 0.1 s interval coinciding with the time of the
GBM emission. This data selection has insufficient spatial resolution
to provide a reliable LAT localization.

Since an excess of events were not seen using the standard analysis
selection, this detection is likely due to low energy gamma-rays
(below 100 MeV).

Further analysis is ongoing.
