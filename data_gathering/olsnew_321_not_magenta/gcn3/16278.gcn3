report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We have observed the afterglow of GRB 140515A (D'Avanzo et al.,

GCN 16267) with the 2.5m NOT telescope. Observations consisted

of 5x300s imaging in the z-band and have an average epoch of

12.10 hr after the burst. The images reveal the optical afterglow

detected by Chornock et al. (GCN 16269) and Fong et al. (GCN

16274) at a magnitude of z(AB) = 22.15+/-0.15, as compared with

SDSS stars. This indicates a decay with a slope of alpha ~ -0.9

(where F_nu~t^alpha) as compared with the photometry of Fong

et al. (GCN 16274). Further observations are ongoing.
