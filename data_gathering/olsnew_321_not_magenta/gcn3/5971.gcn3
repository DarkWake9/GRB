M. Uemura, A. Arai, and T. Uehara (Hiroshima Univ.), 
report on behalf of the KANATA GRB team:

  We perfomed optical imaging of the field of GRB061222B (GCN 5957) at 
15:10-15:17 UT 22 Dec. using the TRISPEC attached to the KANATA 
1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan.  
We obtained 4 R-band images with a 123-s exposure time.  The images were
calibrated with neighbor stars in the USNO A2.0 catalog (r mag.). 

We cannot significantly detect the afterglow at the position reported in 
GCN 5956 in our images.  The limit magnitude is estimated to be 20.2 
(3-sigma).
