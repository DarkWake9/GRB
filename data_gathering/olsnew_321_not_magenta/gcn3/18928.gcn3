Y.-D. Hu (IAA-CSIC), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), Y. Qing (Geneva Observatory), 
Y.-H. Han (NAOC/CAS, HUST) report:

We observed the field of GRB 160123A (Malesani et al., GCN 18926) using 
the LCOGT-1m located at the Siding Spring Observatory. We obtained 
20x150s R-band images, starting at 12:04:41 UT on 2016-01-23, i.e., 
3.106 hr after the burst.

No optical source is detected at the enhanced XRT position of this GRB 
(Beardmore et al., GCN 18927), down to a limiting magnitude of R~21.0 
mag, calibrated with nearby USNO B1 stars.
