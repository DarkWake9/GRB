the Swift team:

Swift has carried out 449 observations of the LVC error region for the
GW trigger S191110af, using the 'cWB' GW localisation map. Because this
was a 'burst' pipeline trigger with a high frequency, observations were
weighted towards the Galactic plane.The observations currently span
from 10 ks to 88 ks after the LVC trigger, and the XRT has covered 53.5
degrees^2 on the sky (corrected for overlaps). This covers 0.441% of
the probability in the 'cWB' skymap, and 16% after weighting towards
the Galactic plane is accounted for.

We have detected 11 X-ray sources. Each source is assigned a rank of
1-4 which describes how likely it is to be related to the GW trigger,
with 1 being the most likely and 4 being the least likely. The ranks
are described at https://www.swift.ac.uk/ranks.php.

We note that a number of GCN/COUNTERPART notices were issued with ranks
1 or 2; these also all had the WARN_FLAG field set to 1. These were
spurious sources caused by stray light from a bright X-ray source
outside of the nominal field of view. Counterpart notices are
automatically produced before any human vetting of the sources has been
carried out.

After vetting, we have found:

  * 0 sources of rank 1
  * 0 sources of rank 2
  * 5 sources of rank 3
  * 6 sources of rank 4

For all flux conversions and comparisons with catalogues and upper
limits from other missions, we assumed a power-law spectrum with
NH=3x10^20 cm^-2, and photon index (Gamma)=1.7
