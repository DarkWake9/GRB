(for the Swift-BAT and -XRT teams):
 
Swift-BAT trigger 348781 (Grupe, et al, Circ 9113) is not a GRB.
Analysis of the full data set from recent telemetry downlinks shows
the trigger to be due to coincident noise fluctuations in the rate domain
(due to the background increasing while entering the SAA) and the image domain.

Followup observations by the XRT (1800 sec in PC mode) did not detect any source.
