Using the data set from T-120 to T+302 sec from the recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 160408A (trigger #682059)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 19260).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 122.561, 71.128 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 10m 14.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +71d 07' 40.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 33%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve starts at ~T0, peaks at ~T+0.1 sec, and
ends at ~T+0.4 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.32 +- 0.04 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.02 to T+0.37 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.85 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.30 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level. 
 
The results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at

We note that this burst was detected by Fermi-GBM, CALET-GBM, Swift-BAT,
and INTEGRAL-SPIACS.
