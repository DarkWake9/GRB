E. Sonbas (Adiyaman Univ.), A. D'Ai (INAF-IASFPA),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on behalf of
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 05:36:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 180704A (trigger=846088).  Swift did not immediately 
slew to the burst due to an Earth limb constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 32.638, +69.948 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 10m 33s
   Dec(J2000) = +69d 56' 52"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex set
of peaks with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.1
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. Sonbas (edasonbas AT yahoo.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
