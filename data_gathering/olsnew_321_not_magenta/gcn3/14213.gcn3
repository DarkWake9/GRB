Gendre B. (Artemis/IRAP), Dereli, H. (Artemis/OCA), Atteia J.L. 
(IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 130215A detected by SWIFT (trigger 548760,
D'Elia et al., GCN 14204) with the TAROT robotic telescope located at 
the European Southern Observatory, La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 15.5s after the GCN notice (704.3s after the
SWIFT trigger). The elevation of the field decreased from 20 degrees 
above horizon and weather conditions were good.

At the position reported by Zheng et al. (GCN 14205) we clearly detect
the afterglow between 704s and 5481 seconds after the trigger. We also
confirm the peak in the light curve around 750s post-trigger announced
by Zheng et al. (GCN 14208).

We obtained the following magnitudes, calibrated with three different
USNO-B1 objects (statistical 3 sigma errors are of the order of
0.1-0.2), and not corrected for galactic extinction.


MidTime (s) R mag
719 13.8
1192 14.4
1795 15.0
2723 15.7
4439 16.3

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=163.0747 lat=-39.7685 and the galactic 
extinction in R band is 0.3 magnitudes estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 
1998ApJ...500..525S.
