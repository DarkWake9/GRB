TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4700
SUBJECT: GRB 060204A: ROSAT Pointing

I note that a faint ROSAT PSPC source was detected in a 
pointed observation in 1992 at a position and flux consistent
with the Swift XRT source (Morris et al., GCN 4685) in the
INTEGRAL error circle of GRB 060204A (Mereghetti et al., 
GCN 4654, 4659).  This is not the RASS source mentioned
by Kong (GCN 4676).

The source 2RXP J152858.6-392721 has 0.0112+/-0.0023 ct/s,
and its 8" radius error circle is also very near the bright
variable star detected in the Swift UVOT (Cucchiara et al.,
GCN 4698), suggesting that these objects are identical:

                  R.A.(2000)     Dec.(2000)   +/-(")  
  --------------------------------------------------	
  Swift XRT       15 28 58.4    -39 27 28.5     5
  ROSAT PSPC      15 28 58.55   -39 27 20.9     8
  USNO B1.0       15 28 58.79   -39 27 30.4
  --------------------------------------------------

These results together argue that the Swift candidate is a
variable Galactic source rather than a GRB afterglow.
