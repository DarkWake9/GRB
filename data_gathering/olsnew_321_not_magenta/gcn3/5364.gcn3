TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  5364
SUBJECT: GRB 060728: Swift/UVOT Upper Limits

A. N. Morgan, M. M. Chester, and C. Pagani (PSU) report on 
behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift UVOT began taking data on the field of GRB 060728
121s after the BAT trigger (Pagani et al., GCN Circ 5360). 
No new source, relative to the DSS, is seen inside the 
refined BAT error circle (Palmer et al., GCN Circ 5363).
Images were not taken in all filters due to a bright source 
in the field-of-view.  The 3-sigma limiting magnitudes for 
the first finding chart and the coadded images are listed 
below.

Finding chart:

Filter  Midpoint (s)  Exposure (s)    3-sigma LM
V       319           393             19.3

Coadded images:

Filter  T_range(s)    EXPOSURE (s)    3-sigma LM
V       121-6586      1113            19.9
UVW1    551-10828     1553            21.2
UVM2    527-6690      765             20.9
UVW2    578-11225     1029            21.2

T_range is calculated from the time of the burst. These
upper limits have not been corrected for the estimated
Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.012 mag (Schlegel et
al. 1998).
