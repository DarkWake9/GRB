P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma, T. Khanam, D. Bhattacharya and A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a short GRB 190525A, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #24662), Global MASTER-Net (GCN #24663) and Insight-HXMT/HE (GCN #24665).

The source was clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range at 00:45:47 UTC.
The CZTI light curve shows a weak detection in the 40-200 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
