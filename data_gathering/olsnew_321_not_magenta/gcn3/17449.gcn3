on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 10:57:19 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150212A (trigger=630876).  The Swift slew was delayed by 4.7 min
due to an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 285.521, +47.407 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 02m 05s
   Dec(J2000) = +47d 24' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single FRED peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift did not slew until T0+4.7
minutes. By this time Swift had entered the South Atlantic Anomaly,
from which it will emerge at 11:26 UT. There will be no XRT or UVOT
data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (kpa AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
