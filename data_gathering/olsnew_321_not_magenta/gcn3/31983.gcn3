The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:51:50 UT on 1 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220501A (trigger 673127515.736396 / 220501828).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 71.8, Dec = 11.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 04h 47m, 11d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 6.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 89.0 degrees.
