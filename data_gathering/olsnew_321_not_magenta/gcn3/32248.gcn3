SUBJECT: GRB 220623A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position
DATE:    22/06/23 15:39:19 GMT

A.P. Beardmore, P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad and J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1568 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 5 UVOT
images for GRB 220623A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 145.39376, +75.82100 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 09h 41m 34.50s
Dec (J2000): +75d 49' 15.6"

with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
