TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1225
SUBJECT: GRB 020124: Optical observations

J. S. Bloom, on behalf of the larger Caltech-NRAO-GRB collaboration,
reports:
 
"Using the JCAM optical imaging instrument mounted at the Palomar 200"
telescope, we observed the field of GRB 020124 (Ricker et al., GCN
#1220;
Hurley et al., GCN #1223) on Jan 26.33 UT centered on the position of
the
optical transient (Price et al., GCN #1221).  In non-photometric
conditions (moderate to thick cirrus) we detect a faint source in the
Sloan r' filter (24 x 200 sec total exposure) which is coincident with
the
transient position. This is in agreement with the imaging results
reported
earlier from Gorosabel et al. (GCN #1224). The coincident source is not
detected in Bessel I-band (8 x 140 sec total exposure).

We wish to thank A. Barth, W. W. Sargent, R. Burruss, and J. Mueller for
assistance with these (remote) observations."
