S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB090531 (Stamatikos et al., GCN 9454) with
the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations began at 4:47 UT on
2009 May 31 (~ 4.03 hr after the burst trigger) and were taken in the
Sloan r', i', and z' filters.  In coadded images, we find no new sources
inside the BAT error circle to the following limits (calculated
with reference to the SDSS DR7):

Filter		Magnitude		Time Since Burst (hours)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
r'		> 21.5			4.22
i'		> 21.3			4.25
z'		> 20.5			4.30
