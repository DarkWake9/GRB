V. Casanova (OSN), A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), A. de Ugarte Postigo  
(INAF/OAB), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), report on behalf of a larger  
collaboration:

"We carried out I-band observations of the GRB 091117 error box  
(Cummings et al., GCNC 10171) with the 1.5m OSN telescope. The  
observations were performed on Nov 18.895-18.958 UT (27.7-29.3 hours  
post GRB). Visual comparison with the DSS does not reveal any new  
source in the error box brighter than I~20.5."
