of the VAST collaboration.

We are currently observing candidate host galaxies in the LIGO/Virgo

G298048 localisation volume with the Australia Telescope Compact Array

(LVC GCN #21513, sky map; LVC GCN #21519, 54 nearby galaxies).

We are observing at two central frequencies of 8.5 GHz and 10.5 GHz,

each with a bandwidth of 2 GHz. Observations started at

2017-08-18 01:00 UTC. Analysis of this data is underway.

Subsequent epochs are planned.

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.
