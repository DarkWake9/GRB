Y. F. Xuan and Y. Xu on behalf of EAFON report:

Mini-GWAC system is located at Xinglong observatory, 
National Astronomical Observatories, China,
including 6 mounts and 12 Canon 85/f1.2 cameras.
Each mount is equipped with 2 cameras.
For each camera, the Apogee U9000X CCD was used, which gives 
about 400 square degree of FOV. The total field of view of this system
is about 5000 sq.deg.

The field of INTERGRAL GRB 140320C (Mereghetti et al. GCN 16007) 
was monitored by Mini-GWAC system continuously 
during about 2 hrs before and 4 hrs after the burst.
The exposure time for each frame is 10 sec. 

No any new optical counterpart in single frame  
was detected down to the 5 sigma upper limit of 13.1 mag 
calibrated by nearby USNO B1.0 R2 mag, 
at the epoch of prompt emission phase.
Combining 5 frames after the burst trigger initially 
with total exposure time of 50 sec 
gives a 5 sigma upper limit of 13.7 mag.
