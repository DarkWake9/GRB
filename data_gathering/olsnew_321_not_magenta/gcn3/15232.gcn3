Swift Team:

At 11:07:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130919A (trigger=571271).  
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 207.288, -10.355 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 13h 49m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = -10d 21' 19"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a broad peak of
at least 60 seconds duration.  This was an image trigger, so the 
currently available light curve does not show significant structure. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 23:23 UT on 2013 December 7. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is H. A. Krimm (krimm AT milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
