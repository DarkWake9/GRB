Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of several iPTF transients (complete list reported
at the end of this message; Singer et al. GCN 18497) located in the error
region of LIGO/Virgo G194575 (Singer et al. GCN 18442), with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its D configuration. The observations
started on 15-Oct-29 02:51:05 UT, ended on 15-Oct-29 04:35:48 UT, and were
carried out in C-band (central frequency of about 6 GHz). Analysis is
ongoing.
