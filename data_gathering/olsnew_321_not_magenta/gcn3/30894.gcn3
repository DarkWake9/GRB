The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 03:41:39 UT on 29 Sep 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210929A (trigger 654579704.256098 / 210929154).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 317.8, Dec = 12.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 11m, 12d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 14.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 67.0 degrees.
