A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB Team:

We have imaged the IPN error box for GRB 000429
(Hurley et al. GCN #657) with the NOFS 1.0-m telescope on
000430.15 UT.  Since a CCD with 11x11arcmin field of view was
used with a single pointing, the extreme corners of the error
box were not imaged.  Conditions were marginal, with poor seeing,
low altitude and twilight sky.  A composite 20-minute I-band image
was examined against the POSS-II red plate.  No new objects are
seen down to the CCD frame limit of approximately I=19.0.
