report:


We carried out further optical follow-up observations of the LIGO/Virgo GW
trigger S190509g (LVC, GCN Circ. 24442) with the 60-cm robotic telescope
REM located at the La Silla Observatory (Chile). The observations started
at 2019-05-11 at 00:49:48 UT, simultaneously in the g, r, i, z bands (the
REM NIR camera was not operational).
We observed the following galaxies within the 50% probability of the
updated skymap visible from La Silla:

No clear counterpart for S190509g is found down to a typical 3sigma
magnitude of r > 19 (AB).

We also carried out optical follow-up of the possible transient we reported
in D'Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. #24455) found in REM images at RA(J2000),
Dec(J2000) = 14:29:15.99, +09:41:12.3 with magnitude r = 17.3 (AB) on
2019-05-10 at 08:07:18 UT. Optical imaging follow-up observations of this
possible transient were carried out with the 1.5m Loiano telescope (Italy)
in the R band on 2019-05-10 at 20:44:08 UT (i.e. about 12.6 hours after the
REM detection reported in GCN Circ. #24455). In the Loiano images the
object is not detected down to a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of R > 20.3
(AB, calibrated against the SDSS). This non-detection is in agreement with
the findings reported by Zhu et al. (GCN Circ. #24479) and favor a fast
transient (like a stellar flare) interpretation for the nature of this
object, although the hypothesis of an image artifact cannot be completely
excluded.
