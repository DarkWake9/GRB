report:

We have searched the triggered and real-time data of the Odyssey (HEND
and GRS), Konus-Wind, MESSENGER, Suzaku, Swift-BAT, RHESSI, and AGILE
(SuperAGILE and mini-calorimeter) spacecraft for any burst (long- or
short-duration) which might correspond to the TAROT orphan GRB
candidate on August 31 (Klotz et al. GCN 6769).   The search was
concentrated on times up to the time of the first exposure, at 00:20:38
UT. (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS and Ulysses were not returning data during this
period.) Without knowledge of the exact burst time and profile, it is
difficult to completely rule out the existence of any corresponding
event; for example, some spacecraft were planet-blocked for varying
portions of the search window.  However, no bursts of any kind were
observed; a very rough upper limit to the >25 keV fluence of a short duration
burst is 10^-6 erg cm^-2.
