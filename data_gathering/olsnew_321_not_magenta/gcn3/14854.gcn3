We observed the field of GRB 130610A (Cummings et al. GCN 14842),
using a 1-m telescope at Mt. Lemmon Optical Observatory (LOAO) in
Arizona, US. The observation started at 2013-06-10 05:54:16 UT,
about 2.7 hrs after the burst alert, and a series of images were 
taken in B, R, and I-band for about 40 min.

We identify the afterglow (Melandri et al. GCN 14843), in all the 
three bands, with approximate magnitude of B = 21.35 +- 0.12, 
V=20.90 +- 0.26, and R=20.35 +- 0.18, all in Vega magnitude, calibrated 
against a star in the vicinity using SDSS photometry converted to BVR.

We thank the LOAO operator, In-Kyung Baek for performing 
the observation.
