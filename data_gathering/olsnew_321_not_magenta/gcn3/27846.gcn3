Daniele B. Malesani (DTU Space), Tapio Pursimo (NOT), Charles L. 
Steinhardt (DAWN/NBI), report:

We observed the field of GRB 200529A (D'Elia et al., GCN 27845) using 
the Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with the ALFOSC camera.

In a single 300-s image, starting on May 29.052 UT (18.9 min after the 
GRB), we detect a bright point source just outside the currently 
available XRT position, which is not visible in the archival Pan-STARRS 
images of the same field. We measure for this object the following 
position (J2000):

RA = 15:55:03.21
Dec = -11:04:26.2

By comparison with nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog, we measure 
a magnitude r = 20.00 +- 0.02.

We conclude that this object is the optical afterglow of GRB 200529A.
