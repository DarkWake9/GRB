W. Landsman (GSFC) and J. Cannizzo  (GSFC) report on behalf of the 
Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observations of the field of GRB 100414A 40.4 hours 
after the Fermi LAT and GBM-detected trigger (Takahashi et al. GCN Circ. 
10594, Foley et al., GCN Circ. 10595).     We detect the source reported 
by Cucchiara & Fox (GCN Circ. 10606, 10608) and Filgas et al. (GCN Circ. 
10607)    Combining our white observations into exposures beginning at 
40.4 and 53.2 hours, we find evidence for source fading.

Filter    T_start (hr)   Exp(s)     Mag     Err
White      40.38          765      20.54 +/- 0.10
White      53.20         3531      20.86 +/- 0.06

These observations are not corrected for the expected Galactic 
foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.03 mag 
in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).    The photometry 
is on the UVOT photometric system described in Poole et al.(2008, MNRAS, 
383,627).
