A. Biland (ETH Zurich) and D. Dorner (University of Wuerzburg, FAU
Erlangen) report on behalf of the FACT collaboration:

On April 27th, 2016, the IceCube collaboration reported the detection
of a high-energy neutrino (GCN #19363) with the updated position of
RA=240.57d and DEC=+9.34d (J2000) and a position error of 0.6 degrees
radius provided at 23:24:24 UTC on April 27th.

FACT observed the updated position the following two nights on
2016-04-28 from 2 UTC to 4:30 UTC and on 2016-04-29 from 1:30 UTC to
3:30 UTC with a total on-time of about 4.2 hours. While in the first
night, there were clouds most of the time during the observation, the
weather conditions were good during the second night.

The automatic Quick Look Analysis
(http://www.fact-project.org/monitoring) does not show any signal from
the source position in the data of the two nights

The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is an imaging air Cherenkov
telescope monitoring at TeV energies. It is located in the
Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary Island La Palma.
