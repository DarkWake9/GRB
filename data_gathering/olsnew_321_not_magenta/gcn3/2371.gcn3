E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, and

A. von Kienlin, G. Lichti, and A. Rau, on behalf of the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, Mars Odyssey-GRS, Konus-Wind, and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS)
observed this GRB at 58120 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a
duration of approximately 5 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of
approximately  1.0E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately
8.1E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box with
approximate area 25000 square arcminutes whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  14 h 52 m 45.52 s     48 o 35 '  39.73 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 14 h 52 m 58.70 s     48 o 22 '  50.08 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 14 h 41 m  8.34 s     58 o  3 '  18.91 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 14 h 54 m 55.53 s     41 o 52 '  25.45 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 14 h 52 m 31.95 s     48 o 48 '  35.79 " 


This error box may be improved, but as Earth, Ulysses, and Mars
are practically aligned, a small error box cannot be derived for
this event.
