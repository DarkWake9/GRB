S. Poolakkil and C. Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:59:26.48 UT on 10 October 2017, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 171010B (trigger 529361971/ 171010875)
which was also detected by Swift-BAT (D. M. Palmer et al,GCN 21995). The
GBM
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger
time is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 25s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-2.05 s to T0+6.14 s is
best fit by by a simple power law function with
index -1.66 +/- 0.07.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.073 +/- 1.802)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.85 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 1.41 +/- 0.15 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
