T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses, HETE, and Konus GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, RHESSI, HETE-FREGATE, and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB
(H2610) at 73640 seconds.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of
approximately 30 seconds, a 25-100 keV fluence of approximately
1.1E-05 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of approximately  5.3E-07 erg/cm2 s
over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl (2000) = 167.280, 42.132 degrees, whose radius is
76.348 +/- 0.161 degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but at this
point it is not known whether this event was observed by
Mars Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be
obtained for it.
