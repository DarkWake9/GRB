S. Lesage (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Team:

"At 23:14:35 UT on 30 January 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 220130A (trigger 665277280/220130968)
which was also detected by GECAM (Y. Zhao, et al. 2022, GCN 31533).
The Fermi GBM on-ground location is consistent with the GECAM position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 69 degrees.

The GBM light curve contains a small peak followed by a
larger emission episode with a duration (T90)
of about 61 s (10-1000 keV). The time-averaged spectrum
from T0-2.0 to T0+163.8 s is best fit by
a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.85 +/- 0.02 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 233 +/- 8 keV.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well
with Epeak= 203 +/- 10 keV, alpha = -0.79 +/- 0.03 and beta = -2.4 +/- 0.1.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.7 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+115.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 11.8 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB
