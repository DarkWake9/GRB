M.A. Ibrahimov, I.M. Asfandiyarov, B.B. Kahharov (Ulugh Beg Astronomical
Institute of Uzbekistam Academy of Science), A.Pozanenko (IKI), V.Rumyantsev
(on behalf of CrAO GRB team), G.Beskin (SAO) report:


We have observed the OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985) of GRB030329
with  1.5m telescope of  High-altitude Observatory at Mt.Maidanak.   The
observation is carrying under good seeing conditions. Using star filed
photometry by A. Henden (GCN2023)  we obtained  a prelimiary estimation of
the OT magnitude:

UT, Apr. 3    filter  exposure  mag
Mid time

15:34:12       R       300        17.80
15:42:58       R       600        17.84

with a typical error ~ 0.05

Taking into account  the data of   R. Burenin et al. (GCN 2079) and
E.Pavlenko et al. (GCN 2083) one can suggest that the re-brightening took
place with a maximum early Apr. 3.
