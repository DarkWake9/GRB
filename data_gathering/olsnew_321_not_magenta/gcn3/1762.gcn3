Ulysses and HETE-FREGATE  observed this GRB at 12447 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately  40 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.6E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux
of approximately  7.9E-07 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 183.009, 36.001 degrees, whose radius is 27.711 +/-  0.610
degrees (3 sigma ).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved.

It is not known at this point whether this event was observed by Mars
Odyssey, and thus whether a small error box can be derived for it.
