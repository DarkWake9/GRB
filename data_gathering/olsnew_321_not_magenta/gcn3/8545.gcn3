Rob Preece (UAH) and Alexander van der Horst (NASA/MFSC/ORAU) report
on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 21:22:28.14 UT on 15 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst  
Monitor
(GBM) triggered and located a weak source (trigger 248476949 /  
081115.891).
The most likely nature of the source is a GRB, but it could also be  
Cygnus
X-1. Since the source is very weak, it is not possible to find a  
reliable
on-ground calculated location and to perform any spectral analysis."
