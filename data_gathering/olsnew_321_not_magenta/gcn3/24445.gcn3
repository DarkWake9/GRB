The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are switched off around the perigee passage, every 2.6 days,
to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time
of the LIGO/Virgo trigger S190510g (2019-05-10 02:59:39 UTC) the
spacecraft was preparing to the start the observations after the perigee
passage between the orbits number 2088 and 2089 and no
scientific instrument data are available. INTEGRAL observations will
restart in about 4.6 hours.
