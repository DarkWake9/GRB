of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 161014A (Racusin et al., GCN 20035, 
Morita et al. GCN 20036, Guidorzi et al. GCN 20037, Xin et al. 
GCN 20038, Nakaoka et al. GCN 20039, Dâ€™Avanzo et al. GCN 20040, 
Mazaeva et al. GCN 20042) with OSIRIS at the 10.4m GTC telescope on 
La Palma (Spain). The observations started at 20:52 UT (with an average 
epoch at 8.8 hr after the burst) and consisted of 3 x 900 s spectra using 
grism R1000B, which covers the spectral region between 3700 and 7800 AA 
at a resolution of R ~ 1000.

The spectrum has a low signal to noise ratio, but the preliminary reduction 
with archive calibrations still reveals prominent features due to Ly-alpha, 
SiII, CII, SiIV, CIV, AlII, and AlIII at a common redshift of z=2.823, which 
we identify as the redshift of the GRB.
