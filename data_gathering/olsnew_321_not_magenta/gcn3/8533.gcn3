Sheila McBreen (UCD/MPE) reports on behalf of the
Fermi GBM Team:

"At 04:25:27.06 UT on 19 November 2008, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst  Monitor
triggered and located a weak, short burst GRB 081119
(trigger 248761528 / 081119184).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 341.4, DEC = 29.7 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 22h 46 m, 29 d 42'), with an uncertainty
of 15 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 86 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of one pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.8 s (8-1000 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.5 s to 0 s is
adequately fit by a simple power law function with
index 1.3 +/- 0.1 (chi squared 367 for 359 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
4.1 (+/-0.2) E-7 erg/cm^2. The 128ms photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.28 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 7.2 +/- 0.6 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
