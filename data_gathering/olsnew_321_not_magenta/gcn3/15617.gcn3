SUBJECT: GRB 131227A: OT candidate from KAIT Optical observations

WeiKang Zheng, Alexei V. Filippenko, Adam Morgan (UC Berkeley), and
S. B. Cenko (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) report on behalf of the
KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to GRB 131227A (Oates et al., GCN 15616)
starting at 04:47:49 UT, 178 s after the burst. Observations were
performed with an automatic sequence in the V, I, and clear(roughly R)
filters, and the exposure time was 20 s per image.
Within the XRT error circle, we detected a new faint source at
coordinate of (J2000):

Ra =  04:29:30.83,   Dec= +28:52:58.81 (uncertainty about 1")

The object faded from mag ~18.6 to be below than 20.0 in our clear
band image about 10 minutes after (calibrated to USNO B1.0). We
suggest this is the OT of GRB 131227A. Further observations are
encouraged.
