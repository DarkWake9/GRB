The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 02:27:30 UT on 28 Dec 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201228A (trigger 630815255.731822 / 201228102).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 303.4, Dec = 32.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 13m, 32d 17'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.4 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44.0 degrees.
