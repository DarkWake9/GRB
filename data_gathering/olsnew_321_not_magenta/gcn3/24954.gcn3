C. Anupama, T. Stanzin (IIA) report on behalf of the GROWTH collaboration:

We observed GRB190701A reported by T. N. Ukwatta et al, (GCN 24934) with
0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. The field was observed in g, r and i filters.
We didnâ€™t detect any new source within an uncertainty region of 1.9
arcseconds (radius, 90% containment) around RA(J2000) = 01h 52m 19.54s,
Dec(J2000) = +58d 54' 33.9" (J.P. Osborne et al, GCN 24940).

We obtained the following upper limits:

------------------------------------------------------------------

 JD(Start)| Exposure(sec) | Filter | lim_Mag |

------------------------------------------------------------------

 2458666.351 | 600 | g | 19.18|

 2458666.373 | 600 | r | 20.57|

 2458666.382 | 600 | i | 19.52|

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree
field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science
and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research
Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government
of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the
Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute
of Astrophysics (IIA).
