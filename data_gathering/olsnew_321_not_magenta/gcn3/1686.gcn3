At 06:38:56.9 UTC (23936.9 s UT) on 13 Nov 2002, the HETE FREGATE and 
WXM instruments detected event H2449, a long GRB.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a location 
which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 08:39 UT.  Further 
ground analysis of the WXM data produced a refined location, which 
was reported in a second GCN Position Notice at 09:12 UT; an 
additional refinement was reported in a third Position Notice at 
13:17 UT.

The WXM localization SNR was 17. The refined WXM ground location can 
be expressed as an error box (90% confidence) of 230 sq-arcmin area 
centered at

RA = 01h 33m 53s, Dec = +40d 27' 45" (J2000).

The 4 corners of the WXM error box (90% confidence) are

RA = 01h 32m 44s, Dec = +40d 23' 56"  (J2000)
RA = 01h 32m 47s, Dec = +40d 32' 48"  (J2000)
RA = 01h 35m 02s, Dec = +40d 31' 33"  (J2000)
RA = 01h 34m 58s, Dec = +40d 22' 40"  (J2000)

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was about 20 s. In the 8-40 
keV band, the peak flux was >2 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie > 5 x Crab 
flux; 1 s time scale) and the fluence was ~5 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 during 
the brightest 4 s of the burst .
