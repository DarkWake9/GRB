T. Laskar and E. Berger (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"We observed GRB 150314A (Hagen et al; GCN 17573) with the VLA beginning on
2015 March 16.1 UT (1.9 days after the burst). At a mean frequency of 5
GHz, we detect a radio source with a preliminary flux density of ~ 0.05 mJy
at

RA = 08:26:40.973 +/- 0.005
Dec = +63:50:03.29 +/- 0.08

consistent with the enhanced Swft/XRT position (Beardmore et al.; GCN
17575) and the optical position (Zheng et al.; GCN 17574). Follow-up
observations are planned."
