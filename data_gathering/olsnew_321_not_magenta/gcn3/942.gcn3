R. Hudec, M. Jelinek, Astronomical Institute Ondrejov, Czech Republic,
M. Tichy, J. Ticha, Klet Observatory, Czech Republic, report:

Unfiltered optical images of the GRB010214 BeppoSAX WFC error box
(GCN#933) were acquired on 2001 February 15.07 with the 0.57-meter
telescope (+CCD camera SBIG ST-8) of the Klet Observatory, Czech
Republic, for a total exposure time of 600 sec.

No new or noticeable object down to a magnitude ~20.5 is detected inside
the WFC error box when we compare our summed frame with the DSS-II
Digital Sky Survey. We also note that no objects are present at the
positions indicated by A. Di Paola et al. (possible infrared transient,
GCN#939) and by J. Zhu and S. J. Xue (possible optical transient,
GCN#938).

This message can be cited.

Correction: in the GCN#941 (GRB010213, optical observations), one should
read February 15.09 instead of January 15.09.
