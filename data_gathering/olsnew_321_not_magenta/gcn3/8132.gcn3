On August 23-25 Konus-Wind detected in triggered mode four bursts from
new SGR 0501+4516 (Holland et al. GCN 8112, Barthelmy et al. GCN 8113).

First two of these bursts were localized by Swift (Palmer et al. ATel #1678).
The others had the same estimated ecliptic latitude, temporal structure
and spectral parameters and so we can with great degree of probability
attribute them to the new SGR.

The burst lightcurves vary from a single pulse with a duration of less
than 50 ms to more complex structure lasting for ~500ms.
The spectra of the bursts demonstrate a pronounced spectral evolution
and are well fitted (in the 20-200 keV range) by the power law with
exponential cutoff. The bursts energetics in this range is summarized
in the table below. The high values of the peak fluxes, comparable
to ones for the strongest recurrent bursts from the other known SGRs
may imply the lower distance to the source.
