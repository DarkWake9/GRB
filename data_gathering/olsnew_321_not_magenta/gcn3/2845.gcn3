C. Guidorzi, A. Monfardini, C.J. Mottram (Liverpool John Moores
University) and the Liverpool GRB team, on behalf of the larger Robonet
consortium, report:

"We obtained BVRI images of the SXC error box of GRB041211 detected
by HETE-II (GCN 2839) with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North on Maui,
Hawaii.
Observations started on December 11.615 UT, i.e. 3.2 hours after the GRB
with an average seeing of 1.3 arcsec.
The robotic GRB pipeline did not find any new objects with reference
to USNOB, GSC2.3 and 2MASS catalogues.

-----------------------------------------------

The above limit magnitudes have been derived using the calibration
provided by Henden et al. (GCN 2844).
After visual inspection of a 2 min R image taken soon after the
automatic sequence reported above, we do not find any new candidate
within the DSS limit.
