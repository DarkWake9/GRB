N. Mirabal, E. K. Armstrong, J. P. Halpern (Columbia), and
J. Kemp (Joint Astronomy Centre and Columbia) report for the
MDM GRB follow-up team:

"Continued monitoring of the optical afterglow of GRB 021004 with
the MDM 1.3m yields the following measurements on 2002 Oct 7 UT:

                --------------------
                  UT      R     +/-
                --------------------
                02:38   20.19   0.03
                06:37   20.14   0.02
                11:21   20.21   0.04
                --------------------

Here we used the revised calibration of Henden (GCN #1583) in which
the reference star has R=15.52.  Although the decay appears to have
slowed over the past day, it is difficult to know at this time whether
it has stopped fading, or for how long."
