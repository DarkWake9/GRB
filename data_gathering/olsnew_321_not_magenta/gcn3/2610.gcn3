SUBJECT: GRB040511: Retraction of redshift identification

E. Berger (Caltech) reports:

"A re-examination of the spectra of GRB 040511 obtained with the Low
Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck-I telescope, and comparison
with later spectroscopic observations of the region, reveal that the lines
(and hence redshift) identified previously (GCN 2599) are in fact not
associated with the optical afterglow (OA) position (GCN 2597), but are
instead associated with a galaxy 10.6" away.  No continuum or lines are
identified at the actual OA position.  We apologize for any inconvenience
that this may have caused."
