report on behalf of the MITSuME collaboration:

We report the optical follow-up observations of GRB 160703A (S. B. Cenko et al., GCN Circular #19645) with a tricolor camera (g', Rc, and Ic) attached to the MITSuME 50 cm telescope of Akeno Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.

The observation started at 2016-07-03 12:10:54 UT (~30 sec after the burst).
Although the first eight frames (each exposure time is 30 sec) are covered by thick clouds, we detected a bright optical transient source in the refined BAT error circle (A. Y. Lien et al., GCN Circular #19648)  ~5 min after the trigger.
The position of the counterpart is
RA(J2000) = 19h 09m 40.1s
Dec(J2000) = +36d 55' 08.1"
with an uncertainty of ~0.5 arc sec. 

Nearby the optical transient, a known source N2JN062852 (RA, Dec = 19h 09m 40.212s, +36d 55' 06.9816”)
catalogued in GSC2.3 is located. 
In the photometric analysis, we ignored the contamination from the nearby source because its 
flux is substantially lower (Fmag = 20.27) comparing with the optical counterpart.
The results were shown below:

We used GSC2.3 catalog for flux calibration.
Further analysis is ongoing.
