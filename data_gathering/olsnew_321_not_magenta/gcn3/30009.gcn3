FROM:    Amy Lien at GSFC  <amy.y.lien@nasa.gov>

A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC) and E. Ambrosi (INAF-IASFPA)
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

We received further data from the recent telemetry downlink.
The trigger time for GRB 210514A (Swift trigger #1048372;
Ambrosi et al., GCN Circ. 30008) is
2021-05-14T18:23:47 UTC.

Based on currently available data from T-61 to T+242 sec,
the BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 2.945, -21.898 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 11m 46.8s
   Dec(J2000) = -21d 53' 52.1"
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 79%.

The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a total duration of ~80 s.

Using 1.3 ks of the XRT data in Window Timing mode,
the XRT location is RA,Dec = 2.95362, -21.88562 deg.
