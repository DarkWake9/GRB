WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, responded to the Swift GRB 191016A (Gropp et al.,
GCN 26008) starting at ~1.6 hours after the burst. We obtained
33x60s images in the clear (roughly R) filter. We detect and thus
confirm the optical afterglow at the position reported by Watson et al.
(GCN 26010) in our co-added image. Due to a strong moon light gradient
in our images, we are unable to measure a reliable magnitude of the
target. We estimate the afterglow is between 16.5 to 17.5 mag at a
mid-time of ~2.0 hours after the burst.
