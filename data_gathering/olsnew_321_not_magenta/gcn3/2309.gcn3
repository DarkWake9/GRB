report:


We observed the field of SGR 1806-20 with the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope
(SEST) at La Silla, Chile, on July 18/19, 0:35 - 2:10 UT. The observations were
performed with the SIMBA Imaging Bolometer Array at a wavelength of 1.2mm and started
approximately 45 min after an outburst was recorded from SGR 1806 by HETE 2 and
ended approximately 1.5 hrs before the next outburst was recorded (Hurley et al.,
GCN 2308). A superposition of 4 maps (400 x 600 arcsec), 8 min mapping time each,
does not reveal any source at the position of the SGR down to a flux density limit
of approximately 100 mJy.
