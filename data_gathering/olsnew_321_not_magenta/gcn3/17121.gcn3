SUBJECT: GRB 141130A: Mondy optical observations

E. Mazaeva (IKI), E. Klunko (ISTP), I. Korobtsev (ISTP), M. Eselevich 
(ISTP), A. Volnova (IKI), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of larger 
GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 141130A (Vargas et al., GCN  17120) with 
AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) Nov., 30  starting on 
(UT) 23:15:04, i.e 248 s after burst trigger. In first images of 10 s 
exposure we clearly detect fading object in coordinates of the OT 
candidate reported in  (Vargas et al., GCN  17120). The object is absent 
in DSS2 and we thus confirm optical afterglow of GRB 141130A.  The 
afterglow has faded from R = 18.5 +/- 0.14 at 258 s after burst trigger 
to R = 19.2 +/- 0.2 at 800 s  after burst trigger.

The photometry is stil preiminary and based on nearby USNO-B1.0 stars.
