M. De Pasquale (INAF-IASF Palermo) and H. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA)

Further 9.9 ks of XRT observations of GRB150402A (Cummings et al., GCN circ. 17661),
taken between T0+643.2 and T0+673.6 ks, show that the uncatalogued X-ray source
detected in the BAT error region (Krimm et al., GCN circ. 17664) is still detected
at a count rate of 3.9e-3 ct s^-1, showing no fading with respect to previous observations.
We therefore conclude that this source is not the X-ray afterglow of GRB150402A.
The 3 sigma upper limit calculated at the centre of the BAT error circle is 3.7e-3 ct s^-1.

This circular is an official product of XRT team.
