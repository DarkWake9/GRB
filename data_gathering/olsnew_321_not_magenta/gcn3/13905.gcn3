N. Gehrels, S. D. Barthelmy, F. E. Marshall (GSFC):

This is a notification that the power for some of the computers at Goddard
is going down for maintenance on Saturday and Sunday this weekend
(starting at ~16:00 UT October 27, 2012, for a total of about 24 hours).
The Swift quick look data at the Swift Data Center and archival data
at the HEASARC will not be available.  Archival data at the ASI Science Data Center
and the UK Swift Science Centre will still be available.  GCN Notice and
Circular distribution will not be affected, but the GCN web pages will be offline.
(There is some possibility that the hurricane may change these plans.)
We apologize for the inconvenience.
