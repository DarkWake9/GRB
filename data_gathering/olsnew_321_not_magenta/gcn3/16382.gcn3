Using the data set from T-240 to T+552 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140610A (trigger #601259)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 16375).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 286.261, 3.899 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 05m 02.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = +03d 53' 56.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 67%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows the emission starting at ~T-10 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and continuing out to T+110 sec at which time
the location left the BAT FoV when the Swift slewed to a pre-planned
observing target.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-6.67 to T+105.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.57 +- 0.06.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.48 sec
in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
