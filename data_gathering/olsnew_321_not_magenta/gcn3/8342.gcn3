A.J. van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:55:35 UT on 6 October 2008, the Fermi GBM triggered and located
GRB 081006B (trigger 245019336 / 081006.872).
The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 144.9, Dec = -57.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 9h 40m, -57d 30'),
with an uncertainty of 9.3 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic error which is
currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi
LAT boresight is 3 degrees.

This GRB is ~9 seconds long. The time-averaged spectrum (8-1000 keV) from
T0-2.6 to T0+5.6 s is best fit by a power law with index = -1.30 +/- 0.09.
The fluence (50-300 keV) is 7.3E-7 erg/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; the final
results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
