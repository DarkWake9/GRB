Sciences, Ondrejov), report:

The BOOTES instruments in South Spain responded to the two GRBs detected on
11 Nov 2005. The BOOTES-2 very wide field camera located at La Mayora 
(EELM-CSIC, Málaga) observed the region of the sky containing the 
HETE-2/SXC
error box for GRB 051211A (Atteia et al. GCN 4324) as part of the 
routinary observing schedule. A 30s exposure started at 2:50:00 UT (5s 
prior to the beginning of the 33s
long burst), i.e. overlaping with the single, hard gamma-ray peak 
detected by HETE-2. This image sets a R = 10 upper limit to the promt 
optical flash for GRB 051211A.

BOOTES-1 in El Arenosillo (INTA, Huelva), responded under non-optimal 
conditions to the GRB 051211B trigger (Mereghetti et al. GCNC 4327). A 
sequence of exposures started at 22:06:34 UT (50s after the GRB onset, 
30s after the GCN notice), i.e. overlaping for 30 s with the tail of the 
gamma-ray emission. We do no detect any transient optical emission in 
the 2' INTEGRAL error box and in particular at the position of the 
possible afterglow reported by Klotz et al. (GCNC 4328). We set a I > 14 
limit to any optical emission arising simultaneusly to the gamma-rays. 
We also notice moderate extinction in the line of sight: E(B-V) = 0.47 
from the Schlegel et al. dust maps (1998)."
