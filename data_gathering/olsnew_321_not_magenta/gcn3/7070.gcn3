on behalf of a larger collaboration :

We obtained R-band imaging and a spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB
071112C (Perri et al.  GCN #7059) with the Nordic Optical Telescope on
November UT 12.9. Unfortunately our observations were hampered by clouds
so the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is low. The optical afterglow
is clearly detected in our images. The continuum of the optical afterglow
is detected to 3800 AA so the redshift of GRB071112C is most likely less
than about 2.3. No significant lines are detected.
