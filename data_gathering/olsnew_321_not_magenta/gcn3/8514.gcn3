J. Mao (INAF-OAB) on behalf of the Swift-XRT team reports:

Swift-XRT re-observed the Swift-BATSS GRB 081025 (Copete et al., GCN 
8409) from 12.9 days after the burst with an exposure time of 6.9 ks.

We did not detect any source in the field. The 3-sigma upper limit is 
1.7e-3 count/s. We compared this result with the previous observation 
(Mao et al., GCN 8411). Thus we confirm that XRT observed the fading 
afterglow of GRB 081025. 

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
