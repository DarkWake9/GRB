TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  3187
SUBJECT: GRB050401: Radio Detection

A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) reports on behalf of the
Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB collaboration:

"Using the Very Large Array at 8.5 GHz, we observed the
field of GRB050401 (GCN 3162) on 2005 Apr 7.29 UT.
We detect a radio source at our detection threshold at
the following position:

RA(J2000) = +16h 31m 28.82s,  Dec(J2000) = +02d 11' 14.83"

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec in each coordinate.

This source is within the XRT error circle (GCN 3161) and
consistent with the optical afterglow position (GCN 3163).
The flux density of the source is 122 +- 33 uJy.

Further observations are planned."
