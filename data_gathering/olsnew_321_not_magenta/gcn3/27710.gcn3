We observed GRB200509A reported by (Troja et al., GCN 27701, Gendre et al., GCN 27702, Evans et al., GCN 27703, Lipunov et al., GCN 27706, Kuin et al., GCN 27709) with 0.7m GROWTH-India telescope. We obtained a 550 sec r band exposure starting at UT 2020-05-09T15:04:19. The field was observed at low altitude (< 25 deg). We did not detect any new source up to 19.7 mag within an uncertainty region of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence) around RA(J2000) = 07h 45m 41.37s, Dec(J2000) = -04d 37' 49.5" (Evans et al., GCN 27703).

The GROWTH India Telescope (GIT) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7 degree field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with support from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/). It is located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (Hanle), operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA).
