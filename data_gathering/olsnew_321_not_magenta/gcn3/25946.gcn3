A. Biland (ETH Zurich) reports on behalf of the FACT Collaboration:

On Tue 01 Oct 19 20:09:48 UTC, the IceCube collaboration reported the
detection of a high-energy neutrino (run number 133119, event number
22683750).

FACT observed the position of the neutrino for a total of 5.13
hours on Oct 1st and Oct 2nd. The automatic quick-look analysis does
not show any signal from the observed position. Preliminary results can
be found at

 From the results of the quick-look analysis, an upper limit of 24% of
the flux of the Crab Nebula at TeV energies was determined with a
confidence level of 99%.

The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is an imaging air Cherenkov
telescope monitoring blazars at TeV energies. It is located in the
Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary Island La Palma.
