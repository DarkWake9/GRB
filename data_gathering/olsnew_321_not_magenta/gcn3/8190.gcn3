We observed the field of the short GRB 080905A (Pagani et al., GCN 8180) 
with the NOT and the VLT telescopes equipped with ALFOSC and FORS2, 
respectively. The NOT observations started on 2008 Sep 5.854 UT (8.51 hr 
after the GRB) and the total exposure time was 30 min. The VLT 
observations started on 2008 Sep 6.097 UT (14.3 hr after the GRB) and 
the total exposure was 40 min. All images were taken with the R filter.

Inside the XRT error circle, we detect a single, faint source with R ~ 
24 (against USNO-B1 stars), visible in both the NOT and VLT images. No 
variability of the source can be robustly determined, hence we cannot 
assess the relationship of this object with the GRB, especially given 
the relatively crowded field (Galactic latitude -12.6). Further 
observations are planned.

The coordinates of this object are:

RA(J2000) = 19:10:41.73
Dec(J2000) = -18:52:47.3

with an error of ~0.6".

We note that in our NOT images (seeing ~1"), the extended objects 
identified by Tristram et al. (GCN 8181) appear resolved into several 
pointlike sources.
