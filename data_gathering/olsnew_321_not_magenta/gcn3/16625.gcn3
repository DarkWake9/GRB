on behalf of the Fermi GBM team, report:

The long-duration GRB 140723A (Bissaldi et al., GCN Circ. 16623) has 
been observed by Konus-Wind, Fermi(GBM trigger 427772193), MESSENGER 
(GRNS), and INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), so far, at about 5791 s UT (01:36:31).

We have triangulated it to a GBM-MESSENGER annulus centered at 
RA(2000)=284.016 deg (18h 56m 04s) Dec(2000)=-22.344 deg (-22d 20' 38"), 
whose radius is 72.790 + / - 0.166 deg (3 sigma).

The LAT error circle (that is RA, Dec, RErr = 210.63, -3.73, 0.35), 
whose area is 0.4 sq. deg, is mainly outside the annulus. The distance 
between the annulus center line and the center of the LAT position is 
0.43 deg.

This localization may be improved.
