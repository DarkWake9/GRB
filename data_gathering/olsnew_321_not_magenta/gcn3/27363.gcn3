The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 15:16:12 UT on 11 Mar 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200311A (trigger 605632577.928052 / 200311636).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 204.0, Dec = -49.7 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 13h 35m, -49d 42'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 122.0 degrees.
