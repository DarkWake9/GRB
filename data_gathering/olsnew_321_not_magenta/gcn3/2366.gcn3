We have observed the entire SXC error box of  GRB030823 (HETE trigger 2818)
with different instruments. The observations started at 15:46 UT (6.9h after
burst) with 1.5m telescope of Maidanak High-altitude Observatory (UBAI).
Two sets of images (##1,2 in a table below) covering entire  SXC error box
at different epochs were taken with 1.5m telescope. Visual comparison of
images at two different epochs reveals no bright variable source.
Observations at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory were carried out with
AT-64 and K-380 telescopes. Visual comparison of all images with DSS2
reveals no new sources down to limiting magnitude indicated in the table.
