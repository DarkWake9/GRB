TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2981
SUBJECT: GRB 050124, SMARTS optical/IR observations

FROM:    Bethany Cobb at Yale U  <cobb@astro.yale.edu>

B. E. Cobb and C. D. Bailyn (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS
consortium, report:
 
Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 050124
(GCN 2972, Markwardt et al.) beginning ~20.2 hours post-burst
(2005-01-25 07:42:48 UT).  Total summed exposure times amounted
to 180s in BRIYJK and 120s in H and V.  Preliminary visual comparison
of the optical images to the SDSS and the IR images to
2MASS frames does not reveal any new sources brighter than our
detection limits (listed below).
 
The following approximate upper limits on detection were estimated
by comparison with the USNO B1.0 and 2MASS catalogs:
 
         B > 20.1
         R > 20.6
         I > 20.4
         J > 18.3
         K > 16.9
