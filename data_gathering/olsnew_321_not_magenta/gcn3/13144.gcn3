S. Meehan, L. Hanlon, M. Topinka (UCD Dublin), P. Kubanek (FZU AV CR
Prague), report on behalf of a large collaboration:

We imaged the field of GRB 120327A detected by SWIFT (trigger 518731)
with the Watcher robotic telescope (D=40cm) located at Boyden
Observatory, Bloemfontein, South Africa.

Our first good observation was 14.4 min after the GRB trigger, 3 min
after receipt of the GCN notice. The source was close to the zenith
with an airmass of 1.01. 

We detect a fading source in the error box given by SWIFT, which
coincides with candidate counterpart mentioned by Sbarufatti et al.
(GCN 13123).

The optical transient was measured at 15.5 +/- 0.1 mag @ 14.4 minutes
after the trigger in the clear filter.  

Magnitudes were estimated using the nearby USNO-B1 stars as references
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

Analysis of the remaining images is on-going.
