Using the data set from T-240 to T+742 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060729 (trigger #221755)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 5365).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 95.288, -62.221 deg {6h 21m 9.1s, -62d 13' 16.3"} (J2000)
+- 4.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding was 18%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve 4 main peaks.  The first starts at T-2 sec and
ends at T+10 with a peak at T+2 sec.  The second, somewhat smaller peak goes
from T+20 to T+26 sec.  Then come two overlapping peaks that start at T+70 sec
and end at roughly T+135 sec with peaks at T+80 and T+93 sec.
There is no significant indication of any emission at the time of the flare
listed in Grupe et al., GCN Circ 5369 (T+174 sec).  T90 (15-350 keV) is
116 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+1 to T+132 is best fit by 
a simple power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged
spectrum is 1.86 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
2.7 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
from T+91.97 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
