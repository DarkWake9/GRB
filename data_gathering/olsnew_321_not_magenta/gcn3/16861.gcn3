TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16861
SUBJECT: GRB 140930B: WHT detection of candidate afterglow
DATE:    14/10/01 00:03:34 GMT

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) and
M. Fraser (IoA, U. Cambridge) report:

We observed the position of GRB 140930B (De Pasquale et al.
GCN 16857) with ACAM on the WHT.  Observations began at
22:40 UT, approximately 3.0 hr post burst.

We detect a faint point source consistent with the
revised X-ray position (Evans et al. GCN 16859) with
a magnitude r~21.8 and position 00:25:23.45 +24:17:39.0
(provisional calibration).  We note that no source is visible at 
this location in the SDSS observations of the field and therefore 
suggest it is likely to be the afterglow of this burst.
