We observed the field of the newly discovered SGR 0501+4516 (GCN 8112, 8113)
with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at a central frequency of 618 MHz
between 03 to 08 UT on 25 August 2008. We do not detect a radio source at the
position of the SGR. The rms noise reached in the map is around 0.11 mJy per
beam. We place an upper limit to the flux at the target position of around 0.7
mJy at the 3 sigma level, due to nearby bright sources.

We thank the staff of GMRT who made this observation possible. GMRT is run by
the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) of the Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research (TIFR).
