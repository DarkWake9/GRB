J. L. Prieto (OSU), P. Garnavich (Notre Dame), R. Pogge (OSU) report:

We continue to observe the afterglow of GRB 080310 (Garnavich et al.,
GCN 7390) with the LBT and LBC blue/red cameras. Data taken
between 1.7 and 2.1 hours after the burst show a steepening
decay rate. The power-law decay index over this period
was 1.01 suggesting a break in the light curve is underway.
