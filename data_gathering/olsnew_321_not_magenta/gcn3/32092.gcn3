The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 04:11:29 UT on 23 May 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220523A (trigger 674971894.896998 / 220523175).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 136.7, Dec = -37.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 06m, -37d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64.0 degrees.
