We observed the field of GRB 210204A / ZTF21aagwbjr (Fermi-GBM, GCN
#29390; Li et al., GCN #29392; Izzo et al., GCN #29411) with the
Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOSC) mounted on the
2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (IAO, Hanle, India). Multiple frames
(each 300 sec) of the GRB field in Bessell R and I bands were obtained
with an average airmass of 1.21 under good seeing conditions.
Preliminary PSF photometry on the stacked images was performed and
calibrated against USNO-B1 catalogue. We clearly detected an OT in the
stacked images in both the bands. The estimated magnitudes of the OT
(not corrected for the Galactic extinction) are as under -

The observations were carried out under the ToO program HCT-2021-C1-P2.
We thank the staff at IAO and CREST for helping us with the
observations.
