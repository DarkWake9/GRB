We began to observe the field of GRB 130505A  (Cannizzo, et al., GCN 14563)
using  80cm TNT telescope located at Xinglong observatory, China
at 12:25:39 UT on 2013-05-05.  We obtained several R-band images.  

The reported optical counterpart (Cannizzo, et al., GCN 14563) is detected in all images. 
A prelinary analysis shows that its brightness is decaying from R~18.05 to R~18.68 mag
during  4.05h and 4.85h after the trigger time. 
These magnitudes are calibrated with USNO B1.0 R2 stars,
