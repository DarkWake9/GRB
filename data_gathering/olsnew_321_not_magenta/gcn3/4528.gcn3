TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4528
SUBJECT: GRB 060116: IR Candidate Afterglow

D. Kocevski, J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley), and E. J. McGrath (UH  
Institute for Astronomy) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Target of opportunity imaging of the field of GRB060116 on the  
United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) at Mauna Kea begining at  
09:42:00 UTC has revealed an IR source somewhat fainter than the  
2MASS detection level consistent with the XRT position reported in  
GCN 4522.  The position (J2000) is:

  05:38:46.280
-05:26:13.14

(+/- 200 mas).

with an estimated magnitude of J = 18.3 +/- 0.1 relative to 2MASS.    
We cannot confirm variability at this time, but further observations  
are planned.  An image of the source can be found at http:// 
bloom1.ugastro.berkeley.edu/~kocevski/grb060116_ukirt.ps"
