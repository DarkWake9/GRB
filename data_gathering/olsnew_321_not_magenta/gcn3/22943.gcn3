The weak GRB 180711A (INTEGRAL SPI-ACS trigger 8101; Konus-Wind
trigger time on 17:02:02.37 UT) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 17:02:00.439 UTC on 11 July 2018.
The burst signal was seen only by the CGBM SGM detector.

The burst light curve shows a single pulse which starts
at T+0.6 sec, peaks at ~T+2.1 sec, and ends at T+5.3 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
4.3 +- 0.6 sec and 2.5 +- 0.6 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
