report:

We continue to monitor the OT of GRB030329 (see also GCN  2005, 2028, 2050,
2067).

The OT found by Peterson and Price  (GCN 1985)  was imaged Cassegrain 38-cm
telescope of CrAO.  Several 300 sec. exposures in  R (Johnson) spectral band
were obtained during Apr. 2. Based on filed photometry by A. Henden (GCN
2023)  we estimate the OT magnitude:

Mid time              exposure     R
(UT)

2.7648                 5x300c       17.83  +/- 0.08
2.7929                 5x300c       17.76  +/- 0.08
2.8436                 5x300c       17.89  +/- 0.07
2.8739                 5x300c       17.76  +/- 0.09

After steep decay between  Apr 1. and  Apr. 2 we observed a flattening of
light curve which may be a start of new episode of re-brightening.
