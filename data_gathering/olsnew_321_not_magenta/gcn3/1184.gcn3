On 10 December, from 00:38 UT - 09:27 UT, the Chandra Observatory is 
scheduled to observe the field of the X-ray rich gamma-ray burst 
XRF011130 that was localized by the HETE satellite (Ricker et al., 
GCN1165). The revised error circle for XRF011130 (Ricker et al. 
GCN1178) fits completely within the field-of-view of the ACIS-I array 
on Chandra.

Special arrangements have been made by the Chandra Science Center to 
expedite the pre-processing of the data from our observation, so that 
the TOO Science Team should be able to carry out the accurate 
astrometry needed to establish accurate locations of the brightest 
X-ray sources in the HETE field within a few hours of receipt of data 
on 10 December.

Assuming that the observation takes place as planned and that the 
bulk of the data are received during the morning on 10 December, the 
TOO Science Team will strive to disseminate the RA, DEC, and relative 
intensity for the 10 brightest X-ray objects in the field by GCN 
Circular as soon as possible -- hopefully within 12 hours after the 
observation is completed.
