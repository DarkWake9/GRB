team, report:

The long GRB 090201 (Swift-BAT trigger #341749: Oates et al., GCN
8865; Baumgartner et al., GCN 8870)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=64020.275 s UT  (17:47:00.275).

The burst light curve shows a multipeaked structure with a duration of
~110 s.

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 6.72(-0.54, +0.47)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+11.728 s
of 7.30(-1.28, +1.24)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+107.520 s) is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV
range) by GRB (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -0.97(-0.09, +0.10),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.80(-0.92, +0.29),
the peak energy Ep = 158(-12, +13) keV (chi2 = 51.0/59 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
