Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 131128A (trigger #579683)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 15533).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 355.305, 31.293 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 41m 13.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +31d 17' 34.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 41%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single symetric peak starting 
at ~T-2 sec, peaking at ~T+0.2 src, and ending at ~T+2.5 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 3.00 +- 1.41 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.90 to T+2.10 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.81 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.2 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.10 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.7 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
