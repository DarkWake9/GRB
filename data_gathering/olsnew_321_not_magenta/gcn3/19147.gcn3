W. Fong (University of Arizona) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the location of the possibly short-duration GRB 160303A
(Beardmore et al., GCN 19126) with MMTCam mounted on the 6.5-m MMT at a
mid-time of 2016 Mar 4.232 UT (18.64 hr post-burst). We obtained 9x200-sec
of r-band observations in 1.0" seeing at a mean airmass of 1.2. We detect
the optical afterglow (Butler et al., GCN 19131) with a magnitude of
r(AB)~23.90 +/- 0.15 (calibrated to SDSS) at a position consistent with the
NOT position (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 19136). Our measured afterglow
brightness is consistent with the VLT value at a similar epoch (Klose et
al., GCN 19142)."
