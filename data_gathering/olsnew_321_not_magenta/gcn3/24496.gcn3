We observed 12 host galaxy candidates with the 1.0-m telescope at the
Deokheung Optical Astronomy Observatorythe in the 90% updated localization
area of S190510g, detected by LIGO/Virgo (GCN #24442).
The observation started at 2019-05-10 14:35:16, and 9 images were taken in
R-band with 120 sec exposure time for each fields. No obvious transient has
been identified to a preliminary 3-sigma depth of R=21.5 AB mag. The list
of the inspected targets in the observed fields is given below.
