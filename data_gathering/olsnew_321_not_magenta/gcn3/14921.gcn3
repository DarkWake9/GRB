J. R. Cummings reports on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 11:42:44.7 UTC, the time of Fermi-GBM trigger 393680570, Swift was executing a pre-
planned slew.  BAT photon detection event data was recorded during this slew.  In
ground analysis in a mosaic image, a significant source was found in found at RA, Dec
20.723, -77.784, which is:

RA (J2000)   01h 22m 53.5s
Dec (J2000) -77d 47m 04s

with an estimated 90% confidence radius of 4 arcmin.  The burst was a long GRB with 3
distinct peaks.  T90 was about 15 +/- 2 sec.

The spectrum from T0 to T0+15 sec is best fit by a simple powerlaw with a photon index
of 1.8 +/- 0.2.  The fluence from T0 to T+15 was (5.4 +/- 1.1) x 10^-0.7 ergs/cm^2.
The 1-second peak flux from T+0.6 sec was 1.4 +/- 0.3 photons/cm^2/sec.

A Swift TOO request has been approved.
