and the CALET collaboration:

At 13:31:12.629 UTC on 5 August 2020, the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(CGBM) triggered on short GRB 200805A. The burst signal was seen
by the SGM detector only.
Because of a problem in one of the ground alert processing script,
the GCN notice was not distributed automatically for this event.

This short GRB is also clearly seen by the publicly available
INTEGRAL SPI-ACS light curve and was detected by Konus-Wind
(see the GCN IPN_RAW Notices).

The burst light curve shows a short pulse which starts at T-0.192 sec,
peaks at -0.144 sec and ends at T-0.032 sec. The T90 and T50 durations
measured by the SGM data are 0.144 +- 0.045 sec and 0.064 +- 0.036 sec
(40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
