P. Romano (INAF-IASFPA) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 15:00:20 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140305A (trigger=590446).  Swift did not slew to this burst
because of the Sun constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 344.533, +15.441, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 58m 08s
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 26' 29"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a cluster of peaks
with a total duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 16:35 UT on 2014 April 25. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Maselli (maselli AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
