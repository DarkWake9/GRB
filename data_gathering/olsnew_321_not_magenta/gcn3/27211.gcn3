behalf of GRAWITA:

We carried out observations of the LIGO/Virgo trigger GW S200224ca (GCN
Circ. #27184) using the INAF-OAAb 0.9m Schmidt Telescope of the INAF -
Astronomical Observatory of Abruzzo located at 2150 meters o.s.l. at Campo
Imperatore (Italy) and equipped with a 4096x4096 CCD covering a field of
view of 1.15Ã—1.15 square degrees.

Due to weather conditions, only three pointings were made covering an area
of nearly 4 square degrees; a containment probability of ~ 8 % of the 50%
credible region was captured. The pointing sequence was generated using the
GWsky script (G. Greco, https://github.com/ggreco77/GWsky), starting from
the high probability region of the bayestar skymap and taking into account
the airmass and relative density of nearby galaxies at the distance of 1585
+/- 331 Mpc.

The total exposure time for each image was 3x180 sec. The observations were
taken with the r-Sloan band on  2020-02-24 starting at 23:47:37.0 UT, about
one hour after the GW detection (i.e. 2020-02-24 22:22:34.406 UTC). The
estimated limiting magnitude in r-Sloan is about 21.5 mag.

Hereafter the log of the observations.

| RA (J2000) | Dec (J2000) | UT time | filter | exposure time|

| 11:43:50.29 | -07:49:10 | 2020-02-24T23:47:37.0 | r-sloan  | 3x180 sec |

| 11:35:44.35 | -07:49:10 | 2020-02-25T00:04:09.6 | r-sloan  | 3x180 sec |

| 11:39:47.98 | -07:49:35 | 2020-02-25T00:20:44.8 | r-sloan  | 3x180 sec |

The analysis of images is ongoing.
