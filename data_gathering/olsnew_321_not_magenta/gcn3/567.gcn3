K. Hurley, S. Barthelmy, T. Cline, E. Mazets, and M. Feroci, report:

Ulysses, BATSE, NEAR, Konus, and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed this burst
(BATSE #8005).  Its Earth-crossing time was 02:33:55 UT.  Its duration
was ~6 s, and its 25-100 keV fluence was ~2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
Preliminary triangulation gives an ~35 sq. arcmin. error box whose
center and corners (3 sigma) are at:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 23 h 39 m 27.12 s     75 o 47 '  12.86 "  (CENTER)
 23 h 38 m 13.41 s     75 o 53 '  21.64 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 39 m 55.29 s     75 o 48 '  43.78 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 38 m 59.05 s     75 o 45 '  41.71 "  (CORNER)
 23 h 40 m 40.21 s     75 o 40 '  59.86 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be refined considerably.
