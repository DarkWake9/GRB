report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

At 2021-02-07T21:52:49.600 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected 
GRB 210207B (trigger ID: HEB210207911) in a routine search of the data, 
which also triggered Swift/BAT (A. Y. Lien et al. , GCN #29420).

The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of a single 
pulse with a duration (T90) of 2.03 s measured from T0+0.24 s. 
The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+1.829 s, is 3687 cnts/sec. 
The total counts from this burst is 5247 counts.

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the 
GRB mode with the energy range of about 250-3000 keV (deposited energy). 
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate 
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside 
of the telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was 
funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
