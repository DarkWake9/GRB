Arto Oksanen (Hankasalmi Obs., Hankasalmi, Finland) reports via the
AAVSO High Energy Network the following optical observations of the
INTEGRAL burst GRB 090107B (Gotz et al., GCN Circular #8786):

Unfiltered observations were made using a 0.4-meter RC telescope
with an SBIG STL-1001E CCD.  The full INTEGRAL error box was
observed unfiltered starting at 16:35UT, 15 minutes after the
burst.  Combining ten 60-second exposures, we do not see any
optical afterglow to a limiting magnitude of 20.5 (compared
with the DSS2 red plate).

A FITS image of this observation is available at the following URL:
