S.Mereghetti (INAF, IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay),  C.Ferrigno,
E.Bozzo, V.Savchenko (ISDC, Versoix), L.Ducci (IAAT, Germany and ISDC,
Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) report:

A long gamma ray burst lasting at least 70 s has been detected by IBAS in
the
IBIS/ISGRI data at 12:07:10  UT of April 24, 2020

The refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A. = 307.5057   deg
DEC. = -39.6939 deg

with an uncertainty of  1.5   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst light curve is affected by telemetry saturation due to the burst
brightness.
Therefore we can provide only a lower limit on its  20-200 keV fluence of
3e-6 erg/cm2 over a 70 s integration time.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
