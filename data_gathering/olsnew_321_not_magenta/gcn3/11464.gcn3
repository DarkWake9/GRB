(Leicester) report:

We observed the position of GRB 101219A (Gelbord et al., GCN 11461) with 
GMOS-S on the Gemini South telescope in the i-band starting at 2010 Dec 
19 13:14:04 UT (43 min after the burst).  In a stack of the first five 
180-sec exposures we detect a faint object within the XRT error circle 
(GCN #11461) at coordinates (J2000):

RA = 04:58:20.478
DEC = -02:32:22.17

The object is also weakly detected in a single r-band frame, and appears 
to be mildly extended in the i-band images.  Further observations and 
analysis are underway.
