P. Ghumatkar, V. Sharma and D. Bhattacharya (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IIT-B), A. R. Rao (TIFR) and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data showed the detection of a long GRB 190726B, which was also detected by Fermi GBM (GCN #25157), BALROG localization (Kunzweiler F. et al., GCN #25158) and Global MASTER-Net (Lipunov V. et al., GCN #25161).

The source was clearly detected in the 40-200 keV energy range. The light curve shows multiple pulses of emission with strongest peak at 20:14:54.0 UT. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 253 cts/s above the background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 11142 cts. The local mean background count rate was 508 cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 209.0 s. In preliminary analysis, we find that 478 Compton events are associated with this event.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated the project.
