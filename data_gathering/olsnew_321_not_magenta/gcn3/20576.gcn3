L. P. Xin,   W. X, Li,  J. Y. Wei,  Y. L. Qiu,  J. S. Deng, 
J. Wang,  X. H. Han, C. Wu and H. L. Li report:

We  observed  GRB 170202A  (Racusin et al. GCN 20575)  with 
Xinglong  0.8-m TNT telescope at 18:29:00 UT, 58 sec after the burst.

The optical afterglow (Racusin et al. GCN 20575 ) was  detected 
in our white and R-band images, with a coordinate of 
RA=10:10:03.48
DEC=05:00:42.29
Epoch=J2000
Which is consistent with report by UVOT detection ( Racusin et al. GCN 20575).

The brightness of the optical afterglow is about 18.9 mag 
at the mid time  of 69 sec afer the burst,  
calibrated by the USNO B1.0 star (RA=10:10:03.29  DEC=04:59:37.4  R2=14.95mag).

The observations are continuous.
