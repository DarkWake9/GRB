E. Berger, R. Foley (Harvard), R. Simcoe (MIT), and J. Irwin (U. Michigan)
report:

"We observed the optical afterglow (GCNs 8424, 8425, 8430) of GRB 081028
(GCN 8421) with the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE) on the
Magellan/Clay 6.5-m telescope starting on 2008 Oct. 28.326 UT for a total
integration time of 1800 sec.  We find a wide range of absorption features
(including Ly-alpha, SII, NV, SiIV, CIV, FeII, etc.) at a redshift of
z=3.038, which we interpret as the redshift of the GRB.  In addition, we
find several intervening CIV and MgII absorbers."
