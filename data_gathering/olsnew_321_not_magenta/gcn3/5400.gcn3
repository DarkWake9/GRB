W. Li, University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of the 
KAIT GRB team, reports: 

The robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT)
at Lick Observatory observed GRB 060805 detected with Swift
(Trigger 222683; Ziaeepour et al. GCN 5398). A combination of
filters is used: V, I, and clear. The first 15 s unfiltered
image started at 04:49:48 UT, 119 s after the BAT trigger.
Our automatic image processing pipeline did not identify any
new source relative to the DSS II red image. We set the following
limiting magnitudes (calibrated to USNO B1.0 catalog):

start UT    Exposure    Filter    Limiting mag

04:49:48    15 s        clear     17.7
04:50:48    15 s        I         16.7
04:51:13    20 s        clear     18.0
04:51:45    45 s        V         16.8
