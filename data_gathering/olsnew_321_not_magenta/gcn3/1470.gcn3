SUBJECT: GRB020813: Candidate Optical Afterglow

D.W. Fox and C. Blake (Caltech) with P. Price (RSSA/ANU) report:  

"We have observed the localization of GRB020813 (HETE Trigger #2262)
with the Oschin/NEAT system for three 120s unfiltered exposures
beginning at 13 August 2002 04:37, 04:43, and 04:47 UT.  Inspection of
the images reveals a star-like object that is not present in DSS
images of the region.  The coordinates of the object are:

    RA 19:46:41.88, Dec -19:36:05.1 (J2000)

with a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec in each axis, remaining
constant over the time span of our exposures.  We suggest that this
object is the optical afterglow of GRB020813."
