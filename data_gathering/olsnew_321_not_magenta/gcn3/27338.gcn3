SUBJECT: GRB200306C:  First Hour Liverpool Telescope Observations
DATE:    20/03/07 09:56:23 GMT
FROM:    Iain Steele at Liverpool/JMU  <i.a.steele@ljmu.ac.uk>

I.A.Steele (LJMU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The automated system of the Liverpool 2.0m telescope, La Palma, followed up GRB200306C starting at 23:01:37 UT (i.e. approximately 11 minutes post trigger) in the r’, i’,and z’ band filters for a period of 1 hour.

We clearly detect the afterglow reported in GCN numbers 27326, 27328, 27329, 27334 with a r’ band magnitude of 17.3 in our first frame calibrated with respect to a nearby APASS source.  The afterglow continues to fade over the course of the hour.
