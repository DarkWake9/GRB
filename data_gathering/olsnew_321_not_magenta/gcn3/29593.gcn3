S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), V. D'Elia (SSDC) and N. J. Klingler (PSU)
report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:

At 01:09:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) was triggered on a noise
event (trigger=1035744).  Swift did not slew due to Star Tracker
loss of lock problems.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 244.831, -15.786, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 19m 19s
   Dec(J2000) = -15d 47' 08"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows no signal but this is typical
for an image trigger and Star Tracker problems.
