A.K.H. Kong (NTHU, Taiwan) reports

We observed the field of GRB 210619B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 30261) with the
T18 0.32m telescope of iTelescope.Net in Nerpio, Spain. The observation was
done with a V-band filter beginning at 2021-06-20 02:37:43 UT (about 2.6
hours after the trigger) for 180 sec. The optical afterglow (D'Avanzo et
al., GCN 30261) was detected with V=17.9+/-0.2 by calibrating with the
APASS DR10 catalogue.
