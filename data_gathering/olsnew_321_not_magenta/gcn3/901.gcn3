TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  901
SUBJECT: GRB 001212 possible OA in 2MASS
DATE:    00/12/14 23:39:32 GMT

I have checked the candidate optical counterpart (GCN 900) 
for GRB 001212 at RA(2000) = 06 49 38.1  Dec(2000) = +36 22 52 (+/- 2")
against the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) 2nd Incremental Release.
It is matched by a source observed on 1 April 1998.  Source
2MASSI J0649380+362251 has J=15.220 +-  0.058, H=14.603 +- 0.083,
and Ks = 14.341 +- 0.079.  These colors are typical for a
mid-M dwarf.  Two non-GRB explanations for the observed brightening
of the source are a flare or color terms between the photographic plate
and the CCD.  Finding charts and the 2MASS data are available by
