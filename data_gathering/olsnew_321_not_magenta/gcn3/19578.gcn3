TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 160625A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    16/06/25 23:51:03 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S. Campana (INAF-OAB), G.
Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and J.P. Osborne (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 160625A at 23:02:36.8 UT,
1325.3 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 176.91418,
-65.14362 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 11h 47m 39.40s
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 08' 37.0"
with an uncertainty of 5.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 112 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. No spectrum from the promptly downlinked
event data is yet available to determine the column density.
