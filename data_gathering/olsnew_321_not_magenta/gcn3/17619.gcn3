At 09:28:38, Swift-BAT triggered (635929) on GRB 150323B. Imaging attempts
were prematurely terminated by a preplanned slew.  A bright source
was detected in ground analysis at 260.447, +38.316, which is

RA (J2000)   17h 21m 47.3s
Dec (J2000)  38d 18' 59"

with an estimated 90% error radius of 1.5 arcmin.

The burst had multiple peaks with a T90 of about 60 seconds. We have
event data for only the first peak.

This is the same event as Fermi GBM 448795722.  A Swift TOO has been
requested.
