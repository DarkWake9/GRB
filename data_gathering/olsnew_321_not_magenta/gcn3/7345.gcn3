P. D'Avanzo, C. Guidorzi (INAF-OAB) on behalf of the CIBO collaboration 
and G. Andreuzzi and Noemi Pinilla Alonso (FGG-INAF, TNG) report:

We observed the field of the GRB 080229 (Cannizzo et al., GCN 7335) with 
the Italian 3.6m TNG telescope located at Canary Islands on March 01.259 
UT (about 13.1 hours after the burst). Observations have been carried 
out with the NICS NIR camera in imaging mode under good (1.1") seeing 
conditions.

We do not detect any afterglow candidate inside the enhanced XRT error 
box (Beardmore et al., GCN 7343) down to the following limiting 
magnitudes (3sigma c.l., calibrated against the 2MASS catalog):

J > 20.9
H > 20.1
K > 19.5
