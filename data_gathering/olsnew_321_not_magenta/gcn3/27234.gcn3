S. Laha (GSFC/UMBC/CRESST), C. Gronwall (PSU), N. J. Klingler (PSU),
A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), K. L. Page (U Leicester) and
A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory Team:

At 07:20:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 200227A (trigger=958592).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 56.436, +9.491 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 45m 45s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 29' 27"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~8 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 07:21:30.1 UT, 82.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 56.43302, 9.48264 which is
equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 45m 43.92s
   Dec(J2000) = +09d 28' 57.5"
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 31 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.12
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 3.08e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 93 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.27.
