TOROS collaboration.

We report the following targeted observations in response to S200224ca
conducted by
the Cristina Torres Memorial Observatory (CTMO) in Brownsville, Texas:

SDSS J113309.58-085247.9, RA: 173.289917 deg, Dec: -8.879995 deg
SDSS J113813.09-113309.0, RA: 174.558000 deg, Dec: -11.552510 deg
SDSS J113817.07-113633.2, RA: 174.574000 deg, Dec: -11.609180 deg
SDSS J113440.11-074557.5, RA: 173.667145 deg, Dec: -7.765990 deg

Observations were conducted on 2020-02-25 from 04:00 to 06:00 UT and
2020-03-01 from 04:00 to 09:00 UT using the CTMO CDK17 optical astrograph
and ProLine 16803 CCD camera (43 arcminute FOV). For 02-25 observations, we
took 10x30-second exposures in SDSS u'-band at 1x1 binning. For 03-01
observations, we took 15x60-second unfiltered exposures at 2x2 binning.
Source search is ongoing and we will report any positive transient
detection.
