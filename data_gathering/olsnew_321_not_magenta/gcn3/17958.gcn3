S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), L. M. Z. Hagen (PSU) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 22:42:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located H1745-203 (trigger=645944).  Swift did not slew due a higher merit value
source being observed.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 267.232, -20.395, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 48m 56s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 23' 42"
with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single peak
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger.
