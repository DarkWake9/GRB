The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:13:09 UT on 3 Nov 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 201103A (trigger 626076794.808782 / 201103259).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 248.9, Dec = 71.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 35m, 71d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 65.0 degrees.
