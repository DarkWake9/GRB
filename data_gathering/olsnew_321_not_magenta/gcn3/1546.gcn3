TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN triangulation of GRB020918 (annulus)

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus-Wind GRB teams, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 47292 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 3 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  6.1E-06 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  1.4E-06 erg/cm2 s over 0.25 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered at
RA, Decl (2000)=171.715, 38.791 degrees, whose radius is
88.681 +/-0.030 degrees (3 sigma).

This event was not observed by Mars Odyssey, so we will not
be able to obtain a small error box for it.  We are waiting
for more Konus data, however, which may allow us to determine
the ecliptic latitude and exclude part of the annulus.
