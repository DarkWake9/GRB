We observed the field of GRB 171001A (Lien et al., GCNCircular #21946) with
the near-infrared (J, H, Ks) simultaneous imaging camera SIRIUS attached to
1.4 m telescope IRSF (InfraRed Survey Facility) in Sutherland observatory,
South Africa.

The observations started on 2017-10-01 19:16:51 UT. We detected the
afterglow within the enhanced XRT error circle (Evans et al., GCN Circular
#21952) in J band. The measured magnitudes (Vega magnitude system) were
listed as below.
