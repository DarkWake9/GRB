project

On Dec 14, 2015, starting at 02.00 (UTC), we observed a large fraction
of the localization error range at declinations larger than 0 degrees
of the Advanced LIGO trigger G184098 with the ILT (International
Low-Frequency Array [LOFAR] Telescope). This is the final set of LOFAR
observations of these fields, our other two runs were completed on
Sept 21, 2015 (GCN 18364) and Oct 16, 2015 (GCN 18424). The
observations were obtained with the High-Band Antennas (HBA) at a
centre frequency of 145 MHz (bandwidth 11.9 MHz). In this
configuration, the ILT can provide 8 simultaneous beams on the sky,
where each beam has a field of view of approximately 12 deg^2 (beam
FWHM 3.9 degrees). The beam centres are given below:

1) 132.500000 5.166667 08:50:00.00 +05:10:00.0
2) 135.287125 5.166667 09:01:08.91 +05:10:00.0
3) 129.712875 5.166667 08:38:51.09 +05:10:00.0
4) 131.106458 7.572944 08:44:25.55 +07:34:22.6
5) 131.106458 2.760389 08:44:25.55 +02:45:37.4
6) 133.893542 7.572944 08:55:34.45 +07:34:22.6
7) 133.893542 2.760389 08:55:34.45 +02:45:37.4
8) 128.319333 2.760389 08:33:16.64 +02:45:37.4

The observations cover roughly 50 square degrees in total.  Each field
was observed for a total of 3.7 hr with 10s time resolution after
pre-processing.

Analysis is ongoing.
