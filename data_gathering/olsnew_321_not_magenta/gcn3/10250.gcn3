The very long GRB 091123 (Fermi-GBM trigger #280652919 / 091123298; 
McBreen et al., GCN 10226) was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band 
All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV 
at 07:07:42 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows several pulses with a total duration of 
at least 650 s. The first bright emission episode was seen starting at 
T0-90 s, ending at T0+90 s. After the emission returned to the background 
level, three pulses was observed again at T0+220 s, T0+450 s, and T0+600 s, 
respectively.

The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 3.78 (-0.59, +0.45) x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+45s was 2.08 (-0.31, +0.27) photons/cm^2/s
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-90s to
T0+607s is fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.30 (-0.14, +0.16) (chi^2/d.o.f. = 63.4/99).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
