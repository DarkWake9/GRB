A. Corsi (GWU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:
 
We imaged the position of GRB 130427A (Maselli et al., GCN 14448) with
the Very Large Array in the 20-22 GHz frequency band, starting at about
1.9 days after the burst. A provisional reduction shows a source consistent
with the location of the GRB optical (e.g., Elenin et al., GCN 14450; Perley et al.,
GCN 14451) and radio (e.g., Zauderer et al., GCN 14480) afterglow. At this time
and frequency (~21 GHz), we estimate a preliminary flux of about 1.3 mJy.
 
Further observations are planned.
We thank the VLA staff for their support.
