David Palmer (LANL) and J. M. Gelbord (PSU), on behalf of the Swift Team,
reports:

Analysis of the XRT data from T+80s to T+15 hours from the new probable
SGR 1833-0832 (Gelbord et al. GCN Circ. 10526) shows strong pulsations
at an unbarycentered period of 7.5646(3) s.

The detection of pulsations, combined with the other SGR-like features  
of this event, strongly indicate that this object is a new discovery
of a Soft Gamma Repeater, and should be monitored for further bursts.
