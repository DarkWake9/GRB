larger collaboration report:

We have obtained further images of the BeppoSAX revised error-box of 
GRB000615 (GCN 705) using the AZT-24 1.1-meter telescope at Campo 
Imperatore (AQ). We obtained two J-band images. A 1200 sec image with
a limiting magnitude of J=20.1 mag started at June 18.9375 UT. A 3600 sec
image with a limiting magnitude of J=20.7 mag starting at June 19.9229.
A comparison of these new images with the previous observation (GCN 708) 
reveals no obvious fading objects in the field. 

We detect in both observations the object reported by Klose et al. 
(GCN 709) at position RA = 15:32:35.16, DEC = 73:50:45.2 (J2000) 
and we estimate its magnitudes compatible with J= 19.1 +/- 0.3 mag
in all the observations.
