on behalf of EAFON report:

We have observed GRB 090417B (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 9135)
with Xinglong TNT telescope from  Apr.17,15:34:38(UT),
14.5 min after the burst. The weather was cloudy.
After combined  white and R band images, 
no new source was found in our combined images. 
The 3 sigma upper limits derived from USNO-B1.0 R2 
magnitudes were shown as following:
--------------------------------------------------------
MeanTime exposure  Band   Mag    UpperLimit?   coadded?
--------------------------------------------------------
16.5min    8*40s   white  20.1       yes          yes
1.63hr    29*300s   R     21.6       yes          yes
-------------------------------------------------------

We also notice that in the location of XRT error circle,
a extended object was likely to be present,
as found by Fynbo et al (GCN 9140).
However, the S/N is very low that we could not make sure.

This message may be cited.
