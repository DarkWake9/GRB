SUBJECT: GRB010222: Optical decay slope

P.A. Price (Caltech), A. Gal-Yam, E. Ofek (Wise Observatory), S. Yost,
J.S. Bloom, T.J. Galama F. Harrison and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"A. Gal-Yam and E. Ofek have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 010222
(GCN #961, #962) with the Wise 1-metre telescope in R-band at Feb 22.95 UT.
Preliminary photometry on the unflattened images against comparison star
`A' of Henden (GCN #967) yields a magnitude of R = 19.623 +/- 0.12 mag.
When combined with the data from Henden (GCN #967), we derive a temporal
decay slope of alpha = 0.89 +/- 0.09.
The results of the proper reduction will follow later.  We report this
now in order to assist those preparing observations."
