TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB 041006: presice astrometry

H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ.), K. Ayani (Bisei Astronomical Observatory)
and K. Itagaki (Teppo-cho, Yamagata) report:

  We performed astrometry with the R-band Bisei image (Ayani and
Yamaoka, GCN 2779) and an unfiltered-CCD image taken by KI with 0.60-m
reflector on Oct. 6.65 UT.  The reference frame is the 2MASS catalog
(7 stars) and the UCAC2 catalog (44 stars), respectingly.  Fitting
error for each coordinate is better than 0".1.  The mean of the
results is: R.A. = 0h54m50s.23, Decl. = +01:14:04.9 (J2000.0), which
is slightly (about 2") different from the value by da Costa, Noel and
Price (GCN 2765).
