We searched IceCube online track-like neutrino candidates (GFU) detected 
in a [-500,500] second interval about the LIGO-Virgo trigger G284239.  
We compared the candidate source directions of 1 temporally-coincident 
neutrinos to the LIB_SKYMAP skymap, with the following parameters:

#            dt[s]     RA[deg]    Dec[deg]      E[TeV]  Sigma[deg]
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.            4.38       136.0        -2.9        0.79    28.2


(dt--time from GW in [seconds]; RA/Dec--sky location in [degrees]; 
E--reconstructed secondary muon energy in [TeV]; Sigma--uncertainty of 
direction reconstruction in [degrees])

The analysis found NO COINCIDENT ONLINE TRACK-LIKE NEUTRINO CANDIDATES 
detected by IceCube within the 500 second window surrounding G284239 
within the LIB_SKYMAP skymap.

A coincident neutrino-GW skymap has been posted to GraceDB 
(<https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/events/G284239/files/coinc_skymap_initial_icecube.png,0>).

In addition, we are performing coincident searches with other IceCube 
data streams, including the high-energy starting events (HESE) and 
Supernova triggers.  HESE events have typical energies > 60 TeV and 
start inside the detector volume, leading to a relatively pure event 
sample with a high fraction of astrophysical neutrinos.  The SN trigger 
system is sensitive to sudden increases in photomultiplier counts across 
the detector, which could indicate a burst of MeV neutrinos. We will 
submit separate GCN circulars if coincident HESE or SN triggers are found.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector 
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.  For a description
