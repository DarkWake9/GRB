We observed the field of GRB 180410A (Gropp et al., GCN 22620) with the
Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR; www.ratir.org) on the
1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional on
Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2018/04 11.13 to 2018/04 11.25 UTC (19.10
to 21.87 hours after the BAT trigger), obtaining a total of 2.13 hours
exposure in the r and i bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle, in comparison with the USNO-B1 and 2MASS catalogs, we
obtain the following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r	> 24.20
 i	> 23.90

These magnitudes are in the AB system and are not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

The XRT error region is only 2.8 arcsec from a previously cataloged star with r = 18.1 and i = 17.4. Thus, our formal upper limits given above may be optimistic.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro 
Mártir.
