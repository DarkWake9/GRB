Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:00:37.04 UT on 03 March 2009, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located a weak source (trigger 257778039 / 090303.542).

The human-in-the-loop location is RA=223.7, Dec=-68.2 (J2000 degrees)
with an uncertainty of 12.1 degrees(radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical
only; there is additionally a systematic error which is currently 
estimated to
be 2 to 3 degrees).

The most likely nature of the source is a GRB, but it could also be an SGR.
Since the source is very weak, it is not possible to find a more reliable
on-ground calculated location and to perform any spectral analysis."
