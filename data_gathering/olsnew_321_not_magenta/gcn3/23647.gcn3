and the CALET collaboration:

Since the start of the operation of CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM)
on October 2015, the CGBM team has been issuing the GCN circulars for
almost all the confirmed GRBs.  However, starting on January 2019, we will
only issue the GCN circulars for the particular types of GRBs such as
1) well localized GRBs, 2) short GRBs and 3) peculiar GRBs
(e.g., ultra-long GRBs, very bright GRBs, etc).  We will report the results
for gravitational wave and neutrino events in case the CGBM observes them
at favorable location and timing.

Note that the CALET-GBM Lightcurve Notices (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/calet.html)
continue to be distributed to the community as before.
