of the GWFUNC collaboration:

We have performed tiled observations of LIGO/Virgo G275697 (LVC, GCN 
20763) using the 1-m Chinese Near Earth Object Survey Telescope (CNEOST) 
at Xuyi, Jiangsu, China.

CNEOST carried out observations during 11:29:44.6 UT - 14:51:15.1 UT on 
2017-02-28 in the Sloan r-filter. The imaging coverage on top of the GW 
probability map is at

and the limiting magnitude varied from m(r)~16 to ~20 mag due to weather 
variation.

Preliminary analysis doesn't reveal credible optical transients except 
supernovae discovered prior to the G275697 trigger time.
