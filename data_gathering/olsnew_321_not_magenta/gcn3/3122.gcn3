Edo Berger and John Mulchaey (Carnegie Observatories) report:

"Using IMACS on the Magellan/Baade telescope we also obtained spectra of
the afterglow of GRB 050318 (GCN 3114) on 2005, March 19 UT.  We find
several absorption features corresponding to two redshift systems at
z=1.20 and z=1.44.  We conclude that the redshift of GRB 050318 is
z=1.44."
