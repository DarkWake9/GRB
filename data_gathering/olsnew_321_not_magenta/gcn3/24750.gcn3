Y.-D. Hu, X.-Y.Li, E. Fernandez-Garcia, A. Ayala and A. J. Castro-Tirado 
(IAA-CSIC),
I. Carrasco and C. Perez del Pulgar (Univ. de Malaga), M. D. 
Caballero-Garcia (ASU-CAS, CZ)
and R. Querel (NIWA), on behalf of a larger collaboration,

report:

The 60cm BOOTES-3/YA robotic telescope at NIWA Lauder in Otago (New 
Zealand) automatically
responded to the Swift GRB 190604B (Page et al. GCNC 24742) only 35 s 
after the burst). At
the position of the Swift/XRT enhanced X-ray position (Evans et al. GCNC 
24746), no optical
afterglow is detected down to R = 15.5 (for the 1-s image gathered at 
14:57:50 UT) or down to
19.8 mag (for the co-added 9x10s unfiltered images at mid-time 15:05:56 
UT, i.e. 8.7 min after
trigger).

We thank the staff at NIWA for its excellent support.
