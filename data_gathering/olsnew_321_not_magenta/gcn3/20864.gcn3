report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo event G277583 we performed an analysis of the
AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different timescales.

On LIGO trigger time (T0 = 2017-03-13 22:40:09.593 UT), the GRID exposure
covered about 35% of the LIGO localization region that was observed with
off-axis angles between 35 and 70 deg, approximately.

An analysis of the data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was performed
on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0. Preliminary typical values of
3-sigma upper limits obtained within the accessible G277583  
localization region
are reported below:
4.0e-06 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 2s,
2.7e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 20s,
7.0e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for integration time of 100s.

These ULs apply to a large fraction of the GRID-exposed LIGO  
localization region.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
