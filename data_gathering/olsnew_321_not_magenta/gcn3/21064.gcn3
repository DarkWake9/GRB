report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

In response to the LIGO/Virgo event G284239 (GCN #21060) we performed an
analysis of the AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data on different
timescales.

On LIGO trigger time (T0 = 2017-05-02 22:26:07.910 UT) the GRID had no
exposure of the the LVC localization region (LR) mainly due to Earth
occultation. The GRID large-FoV covered about 25-35% of the LR on
integrations
from about T0-100s to T0, and from T0+300s to T0+400s following the T0,
with
off-axis angles between 20 and 70 deg, approximately.

An analysis of the GRID data in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV was
performed on timescales from 2 to 100 sec centered at T0-50s. Preliminary
minimum and maximum values of 3-sigma upper limits obtained within the
accessible G284239 LR are reported below:
from 1.4e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 to 6.5e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for an integration
time
of 20s, and from 3.2e-08 erg cm^-2 s^-1 to 2.5e-07 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for an
integration time of 100s.

These measurements were obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of
the sky in spinning mode. Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress.
