The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:04:25 UT on 3 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190603A (trigger 581281470.98357 / 190603795).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 20.1, Dec = 40.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 01h 20m, 40d 53'), with a statistical uncertainty of 5.9 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 57.0 degrees.
