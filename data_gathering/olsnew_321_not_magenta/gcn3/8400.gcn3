G. G. Williams (MMTO) and P. A. Milne (Steward Observatory), on behalf
of the Super-LOTIS Collaboration, report:

The robotic 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope began observing the error box
of GRB 081024 (Swift Trigger 332516, Stratta et al. GCN 8398) at
05:53:49.9 UT, 41.9 seconds after the trigger.  Our initial
observations include 5 x 10s exposures, 5 x 20s exposures, and 30 x
60s exposures, all in the R-band.

We do not detect any variable sources or afterglow candidates within
the XRT error box in our earliest exposure to the following 3-sigma
limiting magnitude determined from the nearby USNO-B1.0 star
1513-0063175 with R2=14.24:

t_start (UT)	exp t (s)	t_start-t_0 (s)	Limit
------------------------------------------------------------
05:53:49.9	10 		41.9 		R > 17.6

The value quoted above is not corrected for the expected Galactic
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)=1.64 mag in the
direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).

Additional observations and analysis are ongoing.
