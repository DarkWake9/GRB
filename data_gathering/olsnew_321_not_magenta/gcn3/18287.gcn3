Yu. Krugly (IA KhNU),  E. Mazaeva (IKI), V. Shevchenko  (IA KhNU),  T. 
Gromakina (IA KhNU), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko  (IKI) report on 
behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150910A (Pagani et al., GCN  18264)  with 
0.7m  telescope of Institute of Astronomy, Kharkiv National University 
starting on Sep. 10 (UT) 21:41:15. We obtained several images in R B 
filter.   The afterglow  (Pagani et al., GCN 18264; Zheng & Filippenko, 
GCN 18265) is clearly visible in a combined image. The photometry of the 
combined image is following
