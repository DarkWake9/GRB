Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We analyzed our set of unfiltered images described
in GCNC 6783 taking account for the new position provided
by Sato et al. (GCNC 6786). On the two first images,
we find a fading optical transcient candidate for the
GRB 070913 afterglow at 1.29 arcmin from the BAT position
(which is within the 1.7 arcmin radius of BAT).

TAROT afterglow candidate position:

RA(J2000) = 15h 15m 01.3s
Dec(J2000) = -24d 17' 35"

with an uncertainty of 1 arcsec radius.

t0+87s  to t0+117s : R ~ 17.5
t0+124s to t0+154s : R ~ 18
t0+288s to t0+378s : R > 18

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
