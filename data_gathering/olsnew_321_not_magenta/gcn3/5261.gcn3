(INAF/OAR), report on behalf of the MISTICI collaboration:

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 060614 (Parsons et al., GCN 5252) 
with the ESO VLT-UT1 equipped with the FORS2 instrument.

The optical afterglow is well detected in the R filter, and shows a 
dimming by 0.45+-0.03 mag between 14.4 and 21.6 hr after the GRB. 
Assuming a power-law decay, this corresponds to a decay slope alpha ~ 1, 
consistent with what found by French et al. (GCN 5257). Compared with 
several nearby USNO-B1 stars (R1 magnitudes), the afterglow has R~19.3 
on Jun 14.12892, with a calibration uncertainty of ~0.2 mag.

We note an overall similarity between the early optical light curves of 
GRB 060614 and GRB 060218 (Campana et al., astro-ph/0603279), both 
presenting a maximum ~0.5 d after the burst. GRB 060614 is however 
peaking earlier. We encourage further follow-up of this interesting event.

We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO staff at Paranal, in 
particular Rachel Gilmour and Leonardo Vanzi.
