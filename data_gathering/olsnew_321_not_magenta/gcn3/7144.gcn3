S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC)
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

The Swift-BAT trigger (trigger=298308) at 12:28:14 UT on 08 Dec 2007,
tentatively labelled GRB 071208 (GCN 7143, Oates et al.),
is not due to a GRB or any other astrophysical source.  This trigger 
is due to a noise fluctuation in the image domain coincident with
a noise fluctuation in the rate domain while passing near the SAA.
