J. Haislip, D. Reichart report on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB
Collaboration:

Under the control of Skynet, PROMPT observed the localization of GRB 050726
(Barthelmy et al., GCN 3582) beginning 18.5 hours after the burst in Rc
(Haislip et al., GCN 3687).

We do not detect any new sources within or around the XRT localization.
3-sigma limiting magnitudes are based on 3 USNO-B1.0 stars:

Mean Time 	Integration 	Filter 	Limiting 	Telescope
Since GRB 	Time 			Magnitude

19h 46m		205 x 40s	Rc	22.2		PROMPT-5

PROMPT is still being built and commissioned.
