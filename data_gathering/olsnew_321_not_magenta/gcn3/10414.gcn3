D. Grupe (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analyzed 274 s of XRT data for GRB 100213A (Grupe et al.
GCN Circ. 10411), from 86 s to 361 s after the BAT trigger. The
data are entirely in  Photon Counting (PC) mode. At this point only
data of the first orbit are available. Further observations have
been delayed due to the detection of GRB 100213B (Vetere et al., GCN
Circ. 10412). Therefore no prediction of the future light curve is
possible at this time.

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an
absorbed  power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.04
(+0.45, -0.56) with the absorption column density fixed to the
Galactic value of 1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et
al. 2005). The counts to observed  (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux
conversion factor deduced from this spectrum is  4.5 x 10^-11
(5.9 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
