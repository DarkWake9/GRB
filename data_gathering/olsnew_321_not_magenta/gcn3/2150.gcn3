P.A. Price, R. McNaught, G.J. Garradd, M.A. Verrender and T.M. Smith
(RSAA, ANU) report:

We have re-observed the GRB 030418 optical afterglow candidate (GCN #2148)
with the Siding Spring Observatory 40-inch telescope + Direct Imager.  
Our observations consisted of another 5x300 sec exposures in R-band,
commencing at April 18.61 UT.  Comparison of our two epochs reveals that
the source faded by about 1 magnitude between the two observations, being
R ~ 19.8 mag in the second epoch.  We therefore believe this source is the
optical afterglow of GRB 030418.
