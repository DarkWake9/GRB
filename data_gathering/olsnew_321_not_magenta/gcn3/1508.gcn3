At 14:57:35.82 UTC (53855.82 s UT) on 19 Aug 2002, the HETE FREGATE, 
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2275, a moderately bright, 
long GRB. In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of 
~20 seconds, and a peak brightness of ~5x Crab. A GCN Burst Alert 
Notice was disseminated 55s after the burst. No real-time optical 
camera aspect was generated at the time of the burst; thus, no WXM 
real-time localization could be disseminated.  Ground analysis of the 
optical camera data, and of the WXM data for the burst, produced a 
refined location which was reported in a GCN Position Notice issued 
98 minutes after the burst. The WXM location can be expressed as a 
90% confidence circle that is 7 arcminutes in radius and is centered 
at

WXM:    RA = 23h 27m 07s, Dec = +6o 21' 50" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst also produced a refined 
location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice issued 176 
minutes after the burst.  The SXC location can be expressed as a 90% 
confidence circle that is 130 arcseconds in radius and is centered at

SXC:    RA = 23h 27m 24s, Dec = +6o 16' 08" (J2000).

We note that the SXC error circle (reported at 17:54:08 UTC) lies 
almost fully within the subsequently-reported IPN annulus (Hurley et 
al, GCN1507, issued at 19:30:40 UTC). Also, the catalogued X-ray 
source 1RXS J232705.9+062419 lies within the WXM error box, but is 
not within the SXC error box.
