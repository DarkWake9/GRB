A. Y. Lien (GSFC/UMBC), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI) and
K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

We conclude that Swift trigger 674752 (Lien et al., GCN Circ. 19031) was
likely the result of noise fluctuations.

We have analyzed the BAT data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent
telemetry downlink.  We find that there is no sign of significant emission from
the trigger location at any point in this interval. But with a significance
of 5.2 sigma, we can not rule out an astrophysical source.

No XRT or UVOT data are available for this trigger.
