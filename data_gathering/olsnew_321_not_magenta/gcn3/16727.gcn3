B.P Gompertz and K.L. Page (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

We report on Swift-XRT observations of the field of the optical 
transient observed by MASTER II (Lipunov et al. GCN Circ 16720) in the 
error circle of the Fermi GBM discovered possible GRB (trigger number 
430148973), 38.9 ks after trigger.

In 5 ks of observations, no source is detected consistent with the 
MASTER position to a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.7E-3 cts/s.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
