team, report:

This burst (GCN 1617) was also observed by Mars Odyssey (HEND and GRS).
We have triangulated it to two preliminary, 3 sigma error boxes whose 
approximate areas are  65 sq. arcmin. each and whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                              DEC(2000)
 ERROR BOX CENTER:  12 h 45 m 47.73 s     44 o 10 '  59.79 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1: 12 h 46 m 19.03 s     44 o  8 '  30.23 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2: 12 h 45 m 58.90 s     44 o 15 '  55.20 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3: 12 h 45 m 36.49 s     44 o  6 '   4.47 " 
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4: 12 h 45 m 16.22 s     44 o 13 '  29.11 " 

or

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  10 h 38 m 18.98 s    43 o 52 ' 24.06 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 5: 10 h 37 m 48.22 s   43 o 49 '  45.70 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 6: 10 h 38 m  7.15 s   43 o 57 '  16.21 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 7: 10 h 38 m 30.87 s   43 o 47 '  32.04 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 8: 10 h 38 m 49.95 s   43 o 55 '   2.27 "

There is a strong probability, which cannot be quantified at the moment, 
that the former is in fact the correct one.  We will attempt to confirm this.  
These error boxes can be improved.
