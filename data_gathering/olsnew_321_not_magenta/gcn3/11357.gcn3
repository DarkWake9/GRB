report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:40:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 101020A (trigger=436737).  Due to a Sun constraint, Swift 
was unable to slew to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location 
is RA, Dec 189.566, +23.161 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 12h 38m 16s
   Dec(J2000) = +23d 09' 39"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual with image triggers, the BAT 
light curve does not show any clear structure.  Ground processing
of the flight scaled map shows a strong 14 sigma source.  The peak 
count rate was ~200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the 
trigger.  There are no known X-ray transient sources near this position. 

Due to an Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 17:41 UT on 2010 November 02. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. J. Saxton (cjs2 AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
