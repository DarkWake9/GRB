At 08:27:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 080707 (trigger=316204).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 32.632, +33.103 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 02h 10m 32s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 06' 11"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 08:29:02.0 UT, 68.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
fading, uncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec
32.61815, 33.10967 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 02h 10m 28.36s
   Dec(J2000) = +33d 06' 34.8"
with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 48 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
6.99e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 3.59e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White (160-650 nm)
filter starting 79 seconds after the BAT trigger. No afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 18.5 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.10.
