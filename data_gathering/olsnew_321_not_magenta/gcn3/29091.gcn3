We observed the field of INTEGRAL-detected burst GRB 201214A (Mereghetti et
al. GCN Circ. 29037; Evans et al., GCN 29036) with the 1.3m Devasthal Fast
Optical Telescope (DFOT) located at Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta
Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), India. We observed a
series of images ~16.6 hours after the burst in both R and I (300sx3 in
each) filters (Johnson-Cousins) covering Swift XRT position (Kennea et al.,
GCN 29048). Preliminary photometry on the stacked images was performed and
calibrated against the USNO-B1 catalog stars. We do not detect any OT
candidate within the XRT position (see also Jelinek & Strobl GCN 29040).
The upper limits in the stacked images are the following:

DATE       UT (start)  Filter Exposure(sec) Frames    Upper limit (mag)
2020-12-14 22:51:42    R      300           3        21.5
2020-12-14 23:27:40    I      300           3        21.0
