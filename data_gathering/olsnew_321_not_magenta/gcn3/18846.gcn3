Nipuni Palliyaguru (TTU) and Alessandra Corsi (TTU) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

We imaged the position of the Pan-STARRS transient PS15dpn (Chambers et al.
GCN 18811); RA(J2000)= 02h 32m 59.75s Dec(J2000)=+18d 38' 07.0s''), located
in the error region of LIGO/Virgo G211117 (LVC et al., GCN 18728), with the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The observations started on 08 Jan
04:11:49 UT, ended on 08 Jan 05:11:41 UT, and were carried out in C-band
(central frequency of about 6 GHz) with the VLA in its DnC configuration.
Analysis is ongoing and further observations are planned.
