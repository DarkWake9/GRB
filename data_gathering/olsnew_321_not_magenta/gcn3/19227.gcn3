M. Axelsson (KTH Stockholm), E. Bissaldi (Politecnico and INFN Bari), R. Desiante (INFN Torino and Udine University) and F. Longo (University of Trieste and INFN Trieste) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT team:

At UT 06:59:21 on March 25 2016 Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from GRB 160325A, which was also detected by Swift (Sonbas et al. 2016, GCN 19222) and Fermi-GBM (trigger 480581965/160325291; Roberts 2016, GCN 19224).

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be:
RA, Dec (J2000) =  (16.14, -72.66)
with an error radius of 0.17 deg (90 % containment, statistical error only).

The Fermi-LAT position is consistent with that found by Swift-XRT (Sonbas et al. 2016, GCN 19222).

The LAT data show a significant increase in the event rate that is spatially and temporally correlated with the trigger with high significance. More than 45 photons >100 MeV and 3 photons > 1GeV are detected in the 1500 s following the trigger. The highest-energy photon is a 3 GeV  event which is observed 100 seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is M. Axelsson (magaxe@kth.se<mailto:magaxe@kth.se>).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
