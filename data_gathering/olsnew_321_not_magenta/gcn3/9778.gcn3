of Los Alamos National Laboratory report:

The RAPTOR telescope system responded to Swift trigger
359711 (Stamatikos et al., GCN 9768) under good observing conditions.
Our narrow-field instruments began observing the location at
06:02:32.9 UTC, 24.0 s after the Swift trigger (7.0 s after
receipt of GCN message).  We obtained simultaneous observations
during the gamma-ray emitting interval in Cousins V, R, and I
bands as well as unfiltered data.  We detect the optical
counterpart in all color bands.  Initial analysis of our unfiltered
data calibrated to the USNO-B1 R-band revals the counterpart
brightening until ~T=70s after the trigger and then beginning a
steady decline.  The following table gives selected observations,
not corrected for extinction, from this event.  Further analysis
of the multi-color data is underway.
