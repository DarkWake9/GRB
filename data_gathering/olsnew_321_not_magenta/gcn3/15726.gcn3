SUBJECT: GRB 140110A: Swift/UVOT retraction of UVOT candidates

S. R. Oates  (UCL-MSSL) and M. Stamatikos (OSU) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

We have further investigated source 2 from Oates et al. (GCN 15724). While this source 
is not present in the USNO-B1 catalogue, it is present in the DSS and GSC-2.3 catalogue. 
We therefore retract this source as a potential afterglow candidate for GRB 140110A.

We also note that source 1 is not within the IPN annulus (Hurley et al., GCN 15725) and 
is therefore also unlikely to be the optical afterglow for this GRB.
