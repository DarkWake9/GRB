report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift XRT has observed the error circle of GRB 141229A, detected
by MAXI/GSC (Fujita et al., GCN 17246) and Fermi/GBM (Roberts, GCN 17249)
in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is
6.6 ks spread over 7 fields. The observations started 11.7 ks after the
Fermi/GBM trigger.
Within these data we detect a possibly fading, uncatalogued X-ray source at
RA, Dec=72.42830, -19.23282 which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000.0)    = 04h 49m 42.79s
   Dec (J2000.0) = -19° 13′ 58.1′′
with an uncertainty of 4.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). The
exposure at this location was 1.4 ks. With the present uncertainties,
a secure identification of the afterglow is not possible.

The results of the automatic processing for this source are available
at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00036/index_2.php

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
