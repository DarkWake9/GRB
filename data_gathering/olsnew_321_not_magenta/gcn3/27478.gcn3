The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 16:30:29.65 UT on 2 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 200402B (trigger 607537834 / 200402688). This
trigger was initially classified as a particle event by the flight
software, but is in fact a GRB.

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA
= 190.1, Dec = -6.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 12h 40m, -06d 36'),
with a statistical uncertainty of 6.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 88 degrees.
