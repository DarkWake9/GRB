The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 05:57:16 UT on 30 Jan 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200130A (trigger 602056641.079094 / 200130248).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 329.3, Dec = -65.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 57m, -65d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 7.0 degrees.
