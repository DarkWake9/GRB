S. Jeong, R. Sánchez-Ramírez (IAA-CSIC), J. Gorosabel (EHU-UPV,
IAA-CSIC) and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, UMA), on behalf of a larger
collaboration, report:

“Once the calibration data have been available we have reduced again the
optical spectrum taken with the 10.4 m GTC (+OSIRIS) starting aprox. 8.2
hr postburst. At the host galaxy location for GRB 140304A, we find a
damped Ly-alpha system with log N(H) ~ 21.6 and z = 5.283. We also get
the same redshift from its metal lines that we interpret as SII, SiII,
SiII*, CII, CII*, SiIV and FeII. This value supersedes the preliminary
measurement given in GCNC 15922 (Jeong et al.) and is consistent the one
reported in GCNC 15924 (de Ugarte Postigo et al.).”
