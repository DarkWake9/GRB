The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 14:05:35 UT on 2 Nov 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 211102B (trigger 657554740.140466 / 211102587).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 300.9, Dec = -2.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 20h 03m, -2d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.8 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 64.0 degrees.
