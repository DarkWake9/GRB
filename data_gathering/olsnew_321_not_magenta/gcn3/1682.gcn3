At 03:28:15.89 UTC (12495.89 s UT) on 12 Nov 2002, the HETE FREGATE 
and WXM instruments detected event H2448, a long GRB.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a location 
which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 04:49 UT, 81 minutes 
after the burst.  Further ground analysis of the WXM data produced a 
refined location, which was reported in a second GCN Position Notice 
at 05:29 UT. At the time that the second GCN Position Notice was 
issued, we noted that a transcription error had resulted in an error 
of 1 degree in the value of the declination cited in the 04:49 UT 
Notice.

The WXM localization SNR was 4.  The refined WXM ground location can 
be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 20 arcminutes in 
radius and is centered at

RA = +02h 36m 52s, Dec = +48d 50' 56" (J2000).

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band > 5s. In the 8-40 keV band, 
the burst duration was > 3s, and the peak flux was > 3 x 10-8 ergs 
cm-2 s-1 (ie > 1 x Crab flux). In the 25-400 keV band, the burst 
duration was > 4s.
