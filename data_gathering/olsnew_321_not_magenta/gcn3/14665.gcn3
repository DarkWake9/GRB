We observed the field of GRB 130514B (Mereghetti, et al., GCN 14638)
with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR;
www.ratir.org) on the 1.5m Harold Johnson Telescope at the Observatorio
Astronómico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Mártir from 2013/05 15.15 to
2013/05 15.16 UTC (14.12 to 14.55 hours after the BAT trigger),
obtaining a total of 0.20 hours exposure in the r' and i' bands and 0.08
hours exposure in the Z, Y, J, and H bands.

For a source within the Swift-XRT error circle (Zhang et al., GCN
Circular 14651), in comparison with USNO-B1 and 2MASS, we obtain the
following upper limits (3-sigma):

 r'	> 22.49
 i'	> 21.95
 Z	> 20.53
 Y	> 20.54
 J	> 19.66
 H	> 19.72

These magnitudes are in the AB system and not corrected for Galactic
extinction in the direction of the GRB.

Our non-detection is consistent with the deeper upper limits of Schmidl
et al. (GCN Circular, 14657) obtained a few hours earlier.

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in San Pedro
Mártir.
