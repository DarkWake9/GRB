MASTER-Kislovodsk robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: 
http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, 
vol. 2010, 30L)  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, Kislovodsk Solar 
Station of Pulkovo observatory) was pointed to the SWIFT GRB190829.83 
(trigger No 922968,Dichiara et al GCN 25552) errorbox 
1215 sec after notice time and 1239 sec after trigger time at 2019-08-29 
20:17:23 UT, with upper limit up to  18.6 mag. The observations began at 
zenit distance = 89 deg. The sun  altitude  is -36.2 deg.

MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  located in South Africa (South African 
Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the SWIFT GRB190829.83 errorbox 
1215 sec after notice time and 6757 sec after trigger time at 2019-08-29 
21:49:21 UT, with upper limit up to  17.3 mag. The observations began at 
zenit distance = 76 deg. The sun  altitude  is -64.5 deg.

MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope  located in Russia (Lomonosov MSU, SAI 
Crimea astronomical station) was pointed to the SWIFT GRB190829.83 
errorbox  1215 sec after notice time and 6766 sec after trigger time at 
2019-08-29 21:49:30 UT, with upper limit up to  16.4 mag. The observations 
began at zenit distance = 79 deg. The sun  altitude  is -36.7 deg.

The galactic latitude b = -60 deg., longitude l = 98 deg.

MASTER-Kislovodsk auto-detection system discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) 
= 02h 58m 10.51s -08d 57m 27.2s on 2019-08-29.86841 UT.
The OT unfiltered magnitude is 14.9m (limit 17.2m).

The OT is seen in 12 images.
The OT decay on ~2 magnitudes  during first 2 hours of observations. 
So this OT could be a GRB 190829A optical counterpart.

We have reference image without OT on 2014-11-20.85262 UT with unfiltered 
magnitude limit 20.7m.
