"At 17:22:16.39 UT on 12 october 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 121012A (trigger 371755339 / 121012724).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 33.4, DEC = +14.6 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 02 h 14 m, 14 d 24 '), with an uncertainty
of 6.8 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 75 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse
with a duration (T90) of about 0.45 s (50-300 keV).

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.128 s to T0+0.320 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.47 +/- 0.11 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 540 +/- 70 keV
(Castor statistics 708.86 for 729 d.o.f.).
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.15 +/- 0.07)E-06 erg/cm^2.

The 64-msec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+0.064 s
in the 10-1000 keV band is 12.4 +/- 1.1 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
