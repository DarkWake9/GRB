We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 181110A (Evans et al. GCN
23413; Yamanaka et al., GCN 23414; Murata et al. GCN 23415) with the
ESO-VLT UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.  We acquired four
600 second spectra on UT 2018-11-11 between 00:36 and 01:21,
approximately 16 hours after the GRB.  The optical afterglow was R~20.4
at this time.

Continuum is detected in the reduced spectrum across the entire spectral
range of the instrument (blue limit of 3000 Angstroms).  Several weak
absorption features are also detected: in particular, we identify Mg II
and Fe II at a common redshift of z=1.505, identifying this as the most
likely redshift of the GRB.  An additional intervening system is also
identified from (probable) Mg II absorption at z=0.28.

We acknowledge the ESO observing staff at Paranal, including Stephane
Brillant and Eleonora Sani.
