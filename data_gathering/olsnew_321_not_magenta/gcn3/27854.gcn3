The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 12:05:34 UT on 29 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200529B (trigger 612446739.895772 / 200529504).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 337.2, Dec = 55.2 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 28m, 55d 12'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 35.0 degrees.
