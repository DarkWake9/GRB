At 06:38:08 on July 20, 2009 Swift-BAT rate-triggered on GRB 090720
(BAT trigger #357811). The burst was also detected by the Fermi
GBM (trigger #269764690, Rau, GCN #9688). No source was found
onboard in automated processing. A significant source on the edge
of the BAT field of view was found in ground processing. The
position was RA, Dec 203.694, -10.335, which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000) 13h 34m 46.6s
Dec (J2000) -10d 20m 06s

with an error radius of 3 arcmin (estimated 90% containment). This
was 6 degrees from the Fermi GBM ground position, just outside the
GBM 1-sigma radius.

As seen in BAT, the burst was a single weak pulse about 3 seconds
long.

A Swift TOO has been requested and approved.

The Swift Burst Advocate for this burst is Erik Hoversten (hoversten
at astro dot psu dot edu). Please contact the BA by email if you
require additional information regarding Swift followup of this
burst. In extremely urgent cases, after trying the Burst Advocate,
you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see Swift TOO web site for
information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
