We observed the field of the EM counterpart to the LVC trigger G298048 with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) starting on 2017-08-19T17:10:09UT  (PI
Fong).
We do not find evidence for significant X-ray emission at the location of
the optical transient (RA= 13:09:48.08, Dec= -23:22:53.2,  Coulter et al.
LVC GCN 21529; Allam et al., LVC GCN 21530; Sheng Yang et al., LVC GCN
21531; Chambers et al. LVC GCN 21553).

An extended X-ray source is clearly detected at:
RA= 13:09:47.7
dec= -23:23:02.0

This position is consistent with the radio source that we identified in
Alexander et al. (LVC GCN 21589) and it is centered on the host-galaxy
optical position. Based on preliminary analysis, we estimate a flux ~1e-14
erg/s/cm2 in the 0.3-10 keV band.

The CXO X-ray source lies outside the 90% containment, but within the
3-sigma containment, of the localization region of the Swift-XRT source
(Evans et al., LVC GCN 21612). The flux inferred by Evans et al., Fx=2.6
(+1.1, -0.9) e-14 erg/cm^2/s is also consistent with our results. We thus
suggest that the X-ray source identified by Swift-XRT is most likely
emission from the host galaxy.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the entire Chandra team for their great support
with these observations.
