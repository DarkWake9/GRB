NUMBER:  940
SUBJECT: GRB010213, Near-IR observations
DATE:    01/02/15 18:09:01 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have imaged the inner 6.5x6.5 arcmin portion of the
HETE error circle with the USNOFS 1.55-m telescope and the
ASTROCAM infrared camera at H-band, starting at 010215.42 UT.
Poor seeing conditions limited the depth of the image,
but the limiting magnitude is approximately equivalent to
that of the POSS-IIF red plate for this field.
  We find no object that does not have a counterpart
on the POSS-II plate.
