V. D'Elia (ASDC) & L. Izzo (URoma/ICRA) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team

Swift-XRT has observed the error box of the IPN GRB 141215A (Hurley et  al. GCN 17186) in a series of observations tiled on the sky. The total exposure time is 8.0 ks spread over 2 fields. The observations started ~100 ks after the IPN trigger and cover ~80% of the error box. We detect three sources with S/N>2.5 within the IPN error box, namely (ordered by descending RA):

Source 1
RA:  178.98953 = 11h 55m 57.49s (J2000) 
Dec: -52.90081 = -52d 54' 02.9" (J2000)
Err: 3.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence)
Exposure time: 3.3 ks.

Source 2
RA:  178.95882 = 11h 55m 50.12s (J2000) 
Dec: -52.82640 = -52d 49' 35.1" (J2000)
Err: 4.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence)
Exposure time: 3.4 ks.

Source 3
RA:  178.80790 = 11h 55m 13.90s (J2000) 
Dec: -52.84520 = -52d 50' 42.7" (J2000)
Err: 5.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence)
Exposure time: 3.4 ks.


Source #1 has a 2MASS counterpart and it is fairly bright (5E-2 cts/s) for being an X-ray afterglow at more than 30 hours from the trigger. Thus, the current candidates are #2 and #3. We cannot assess variability at this time, so a secure identification of the afterglow is not possible. We caution that the XRT observations cover just 80% of the IPN error box. A further Swift-XRT follow-up is planned.
