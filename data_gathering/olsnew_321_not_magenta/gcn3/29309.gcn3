Tomas Ahumada (UMD), John Della Costa(SDSU), Brad Cenko (NASA GSFC), and
Robert Quimby (SDSU):

We imaged the position of ZTF21aaeyldq (Ho et al., GCN 29305), a ZTF
discovered fast-fading transient with the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI)
mounted at the 4.3m Lowell Discovery Telescope, starting at 2021-01-17
07:59:33 UT.
We acquired three 180 sec exposures in the i-band and reduced them
following standard procedures. Our image shows a clear source at the
position reported by Ho et al. We calibrated the flux against SDSS sources
in the field and derived a magnitude of 22.1 +- 0.2 mag. The magnitude we
report is not extinction corrected.

We thank the LDT staff, particularly Stephen Levine and Amanda Bosh for
their assistance.
