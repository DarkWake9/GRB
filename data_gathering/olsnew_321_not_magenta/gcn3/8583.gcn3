Ground analysis of BAT event data from trigger 335971 shows a weak
image peak and a weak excess in the light curve on the interval T0
to T+60 sec, 15-50 kev. We cannot confirm nor completely rule out a
legitimate source. The best ground-derived position is
RA, Dec 324.330, +21.498, which is

    RA(J2000) = 21h 37m 19.2s
    Dec(J2000) = +21d 30' 51"

with an uncertainty radius of 3 arcmin (90% confidence, stat+sys).

XRT data show no sources within the BAT error circle.
