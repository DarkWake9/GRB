and the CALET collaboration:

The GRB 180809A (MAXI/GSC detection: Yatabe et al., GCN Circ. 23103;
Fermi-GBM trigger #555507497) was detected in ground analysis
of the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) data near the MAXI trigger
time at T0=11:38:25 UT on 9 August 2018.
The burst signal was seen by all CGBM detectors.

The burst light curve shows a weak pulse which starts
at T-15.1 sec and ends at T-4.2 sec.
The T90 and the T50 durations measured by the SGM data are
10.0 +- 1.6 sec and 5.0 +- 1.6 sec (40-1000 keV), respectively.

The ground processed light curve is available at

http://cgbm.calet.jp/cgbm_trigger/ground/1217849910/

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by
the Waseda CALET Operation Center located at the Waseda University.
