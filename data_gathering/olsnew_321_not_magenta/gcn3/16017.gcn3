C. Pagani, K.L. Page and P.A. Evans report on behalf of the Swift-XRT
team:

We have analysed 4.0 ks of XRT data for the INTEGRAL-detected burst:
GRB 140320C,  from 19.5 ks to 37.3 ks after the  INTEGRAL trigger. The
data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.  An X-ray source is
detected within the INTEGRAL error circle. Using 1552 s of PC mode data
and 1 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT
alignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):
RA, Dec = 134.39421, +71.19839 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 08h 57m 34.61s
Dec(J2000): +71d 11' 54.2"

with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 27 arcsec from the INTEGRAL position. 

The light curve can be modelled with  a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=2.8 (+1.0, -1.7).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 1.3 (+0.9, -0.3) and an
absorption column consistent with the Galactic value of 3.6 x 10^20
cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The  counts to observed (unabsorbed)
0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum  is 5 x
10^-11 (5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
2.8, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 2.4 x 10^-4 count s^-1
