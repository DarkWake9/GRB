K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team,

T. Cline, on behalf of the Ulysses and Konus GRB teams, and

E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team,
report:

Ulysses and Konus-Wind  observed this GRB at 84865 seconds.  As
observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of approximately 2 seconds, a
25-100 keV fluence of approximately  8E-7 erg/cm2, and a peak flux of
approximately  5E-7 erg/cm2 s over 0.50 seconds.

We have triangulated it to a preliminary annulus centered  at RA,
Decl(2000)= 166.205, +42.153 degrees, whose radius is 44.920 +/-  0.136
degrees (3 sigma).

This annulus may be constrained and/or improved, but it is not known at
this point whether this event was observed by Mars Odyssey, and thus
whether a small error box can be derived for it.
