Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 121027A (trigger #536831)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 13906 (not 13907)).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 63.598, -58.839 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 14m 23.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 50' 21.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 80%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED with two small peaks on the tail,
starting at ~T-9 sec, peaking at ~T+3 sec, with a long tail out to
~T+105 sec (or possibly to ~T+165 sec).  T90 (15-350 keV) is 62.6 +- 4.8 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-9.34 to T+65.33 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.82 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.00 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
