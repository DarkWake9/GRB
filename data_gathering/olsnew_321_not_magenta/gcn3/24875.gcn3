The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 11:03:27 UT on 23 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190623A (trigger 582980612.094866 / 190623461).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 335.5, Dec = -23.3 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 22h 22m, -23d 18'), with a statistical uncertainty of 4.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 91.0 degrees.
