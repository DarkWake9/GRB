Jan-Erik Ovaldsen (ITA) et al. report:

Due to a typo the time of the brightening event was incorrectly  
reported in GCN 4816.
The text should read:

"From observations of GRB060218/SN 2006aj (Cusumano et al., GCN #4775)
with DFOSC on the Danish 1.5m telescope at La Silla/ESO we find that
the optical afterglow + SN 2006aj has brightened by 0.2 (+/- 0.01) mag
in R and 0.1 (+/- 0.02) mag in V from Feb 21.03 UT to Feb 22.03 UT. An
optical brightening is in line with the notion that the underlying SN
2006aj has still to reach its maximum, as noted in previous reports."
