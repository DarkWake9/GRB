We observed GRB 191221B with the MeerKAT radio telescope on 21            January 2020 from 20:26 to 21:26 UTC (~30 days after the trigger) at a position consistent with the X-ray position reported by Beardmore et al. (GCN 26540). We used J0408-6545 as the bandpass and flux calibrator, which was observed for 10 minutes at the start of the observation. The phase calibrator used was J1120-2508, which was observed for 2 minutes before and after the two ~20 minute scans on GRB 191221B (20:41:04.0 - 21:00:55.5 and 21:03:51.5 - 21:23:50.9 UTC). The observation was performed with 60 antennas and is centered at a frequency of 1.28 GHz with a bandwidth of 856 MHz over 4096 channels. The GRB afterglow was not detected, and we report a 3-sigma upper limit of 64 micro Jy at the position of GRB 191221B.

We thank the team at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) for observing this DDT request.




Best regards,
Itu
