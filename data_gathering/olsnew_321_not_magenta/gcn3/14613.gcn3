Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130508A (trigger #555413) (Holland, et al.,
GCN Circ. 14607).
The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 305.351, 34.966 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  20h 21m 24.2s
    Dec(J2000) = +34d 57' 57.6"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The
partial coding was 60%.
  
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak from about T+9 to T+55 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 42 +- 11 sec (estimated error including systematics).
  
The time-averaged spectrum from T+9.62 to T+56.75 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.80 +- 0.23.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.6 +- 1.0 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.07 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
