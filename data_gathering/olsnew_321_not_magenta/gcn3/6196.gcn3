S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB070311 (Mereghetti et al., GCN 6189) with
the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope.  Observations were taken in the
i' filter at a mean epoch of approximately 3:05 11 March UT (~ 72 minutes
after the burst).  We detect a faint source at the position of the NIR
afterglow (Covino et al., GCN 6190).  Using several USNO-B objects in the
field, we measure a magnitude of I ~ 21.5.
