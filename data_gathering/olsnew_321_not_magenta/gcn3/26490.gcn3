We obtained a spectrum of the Pan-STARRS1 candidate counterpart PS19hgw/AT2019wxt (O. McBrien et al., GCN 26485) for the binary neutron star candidate S191213g (GCN 26402) with the HFOSC instrument on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope. We used Grism 7 to obtain a wavelength coverage from approximately 3800 - 7500 angstroms with a resolution of 1200. We took a 3600 second exposure, centred at UT 2019-12-18T18:05:19.

The source has a blue, relatively featureless spectrum. Standard galaxy lines are seen at z=0.036, the redshift of the host galaxy. Further observations are encouraged.
