TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  2875
SUBJECT: GRB041218: Continued P60 Optical Observations
DATE:    04/12/19 09:32:31 GMT

S. Bradley Cenko reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB
Collaboration:

"We have continued to image the afterglow candidate of the Integral
GRB041218 (GCNs 2858, 2860, 2861) with the robotic Palomar 60-inch
telescope.  We have obtained 9 x 180-second images in Johnson B and V,
Kron R and I, and Gunn z filters.  Extremely poor weather conditions (2 -
4 arcsecond seeing) have greatly limited our sensitivity.

We were unable to detect the afterglow in any of our observed bands.  The
mean observing time and limiting magnitudes of our observations are
outlined below:

Filter         UT (Dec. 19)     Limiting Magnitude
----------------------------------------------------------------------
B              04:47            20.5
V              05:01            20.3
R              05:17            20.1
I              05:38            19.7
z              05:53            19.4

No further observations at the Palomar 60-inch are planned."
