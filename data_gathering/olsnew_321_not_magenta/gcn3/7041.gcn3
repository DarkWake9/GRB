K. Antonyuk, V. Rumyantsev (CrAO),  A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of
larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow (Oksanen GCN 6873, Kann et al. GCN 6884)
of  GRB071010b  (Markwardt  et al., GCN 6871) in R-band on Oct.12 between
(UT) 01:01:50 - 02:03:27  with AZT-11 telescope of CrAO. Based on  USNO-B1.0
star RA (J2000) = 10:02:09.93, Dec. (J2000) = +45:41:18.4, R2=16.80 we
estimated brightness of  the optical afterglow on a stacked image:

T0+,       Exposure,     R_mag,   err
(mid time)

1.1989 d    12x300 s     20.70     +/-0.08

In comparison with the afterglow brightness obtained 2 and 3 days after
burst (Klunko et al. GCN 6945), where photometry used the same calibration
star, one can suggest either re-brightening between 1st and 3rd days, or at
least plateau on the light curve.

The message may be cited.
