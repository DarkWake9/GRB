T. N. Ukwatta (LANL), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC),
J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC) and K. L. Page (U Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 03:05:12 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 151228A (trigger=668543).  Swift did not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 214.004, -17.689, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 16m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 41' 19"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
structure with a duration of about 0.6 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is T. N. Ukwatta (tilan.ukwatta AT gmail.com). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
