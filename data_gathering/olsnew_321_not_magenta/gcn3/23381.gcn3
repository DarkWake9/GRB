MASTER Global Robotic Net started automatically IC181023A alert (from
socket coordinates)  observations  22 sec after notice time (MASTER-Tavrida) and
continued 1 day later as  IceCube-181023A (Blaufuss et al.GCN 23375,Pizzuto et al. GCN 23380) inspection  at MASTER-Kislovodsk.

MASTER-Tavrida robotic telescope (MASTER Net: Lipunov et.al.  2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L  http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aa/2010/349171/),
located in Lomonosov MSU, SAI Crimean astronomical station,
was pointed automatically to the  IC181023A error-box (taken from the socket)
22 sec after notice time and 66 sec after trigger time at 2018-10-23 16:38:38 UT.
We observed this socket error-box with unfiltered mlim=18.3 and not found 
new OT, connected with EHE neutrino astrophysical source.

The galactic latitude b =  7 deg., longitude l = 19 deg.
The observations made on zenit distance = 68 deg.
The sun  altitude  was -20.7 deg.
The moon (99 % bright part) was 21 deg. above the horizon. The distance 
between  moon and  object was 109 deg.


MASTER-Kislovodsk started IceCube-181023A (Blaufuss et al.GCN 23375 (RA:270.18 (-1.70,+2.00 deg); Dec: -8.57 (-1.30,+1.25 deg))
  inspection  with  mlim=17.0 between clouds  at 2018-10-24 15:31:39 UT

The observations made on zenit distance = 63 deg.
The moon (100 % bright part) was 11 deg. above the horizon. The distance  between  moon and  object was 121 deg.
The sun  altitude  was -15.2 deg.

Observations and more accurate reduction will be continued.
