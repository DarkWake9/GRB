(IfA, UH) report:

We have observed the error circle of GRB 041006 (HETE #3570) with the
Wide Field Imager on the SSO 40-inch telescope.  Inspected exposures at
this time consist of a single 300 sec integration in V-band at 2004 Oct
6.54 UT.  Comparison with the DSS yields an optical afterglow candidate
at the coordinates:

	00:54:50.17 +01:14:07.0 J2000

Further results will follow.
