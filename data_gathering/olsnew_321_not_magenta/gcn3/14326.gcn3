A. Cucchiara (UCSC/UCO Lick Observatory), S. B. Cenko 
(UC Berkeley), D. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of 
a large collaboration:

"On March 20.31 UT we observed again the field of GRB 130305A 
(Cummings & Palmer, GCN 14257; Yu & Xiong, GCN 14261; 
Guiriec et al., GCN 14260) with the Gemini-North telescope
equipped with the GMOS camera.

We obtained 7x180s exposures, for a total integration time
of 21 minutes (T_mid = T0+13.10 days). 

We compared the coadded image with our pervious observation 
(Cucchiara et al. GCN 14272) and performed an image subtraction 
between the two epochs.

No variable source appears in the subtraction image, in particular 
we note that the galaxy reported in GCN 14272 appears of constant 
brightness.

We estimated a limiting magnitude of r' > 26.0 within the XRT
circle.

We thank the Gemini staff for performing this observation.
