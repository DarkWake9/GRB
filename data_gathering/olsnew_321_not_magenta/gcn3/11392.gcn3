We searched for an optical afterglow of GRB101030A (GCN 11386, Melandri et
al.)
starting from 15:59:39 UT on 2010 Oct. 30th with the MOA-II 1.8m telescope
at Mt.John observatory in New Zealand. The images were taken with a wideband
Red filter
(center wavelength ~ 750nm and FWHM ~ 250nm), and we found a new source
within
the error circle of the Swift XRT source position (GCN 11387).
The estimated magnitudes are the followings.

t-t0(sec) Imag err exp.
-------------------------
190  20.0  2.3  300
610  19.5  4.0  100
-------------------------

Large errors in the magnitude estimation are due to the observations
during dawn and under the moon light. Consequently, relatively small
number of field stars affects in the large errors.
These magnitudes were calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 catalog stars,
and not corrected for the Galactic extinction.
