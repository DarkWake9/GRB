MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope  (Global MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L)  located in South Africa (South African Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB201024.12 (trigger No 1001514,08h 23m 47.52s , +03d 22m 37.2s, R=0.05) errorbox  28 sec after notice time and 43 sec after trigger time at 2020-10-24 02:49:43 UT, with upper limit up to  16.2 mag. Observations started at twilight.  The observations began at zenith distance = 46 deg. The sun  altitude  is -12.7 deg. 

MASTER-IAC robotic telescope  located in Spain (IAC Teide Observatory) was pointed to the Swift GRB201024.12 errorbox  146 sec after notice time and 161 sec after trigger time at 2020-10-24 02:51:40 UT, with upper limit up to  16.9 mag. The observations began at zenith distance = 67 deg. The sun  altitude  is -56.7 deg. 

The galactic latitude b = 23 deg., longitude l = 221 deg.
