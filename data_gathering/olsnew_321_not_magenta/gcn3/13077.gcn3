SUBJECT: GRB 120320A: Gemini-N and UKIRT observations

A. J. Levan (U. Warwick), N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), T. Wold (JACH) and
R. Mason (Gemini) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained observations of the field of GRB 120320A (Markwardt et al.
GCN13071) with both Gemini-N/GMOS in i and z, and UKIRT/WFCAM in J, H
and K. Our first observations began approximately 30 minutes after the burst,
and continued for a further 2 hours.

Within the refined X-ray error circle (Beardmore et al. GCN 13075) we detect a
very faint source in our GMOS imaging at position (accuracy ~0.5"):

RA(2000)=14:10:04.28
dec(2000)=08:41:47.9

The source has i~25.7+/-0.3 and z~25.3+/-0.3. It is undetected in the UKIRT
imaging to preliminary limits of J>21.6, H>20.0 and K>19.5.

This source could therefore be related to either the afterglow or the host galaxy of
GRB 120320A, but at the current time we cannot make any statements about fading.
