At 22:20:22 UT on October 10, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
triggered on GRB 071010C (trigger #293804). The burst was on the edge 
of the field of view (3.5% coded) and no source was found automatically 
onboard. A source was found during later ground analysis at a location 
RA, Dec 338.054, +66.159 which is
   RA(J2000)  =  22h 32m 13s
   Dec(J2000) = +66d 09' 32"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve shows a single 
slow-rise slow-decay peak about 12 seconds long. The peak count 
rate was about 1000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Because the burst was detected on the ground, there are no prompt
XRT or UVOT data.
