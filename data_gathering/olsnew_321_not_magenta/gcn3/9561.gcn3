J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), P. Kubanek (GACE and IAA-CSIC), S. Mottola  
(DLR), U. Carsenty (DLR), A. Levan (U. Warwick), M. Jelinek (IAA- 
CSIC), A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), A. de Ugarte Postigo (ESO, INAF/ 
OAB), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Following the detection of the short-hard GRB 090621B by SWIFT  
(Curran et al. GCNC 9545) we carried out I-band observations with the  
1.23m telescope at Observatory of Calar Alto. The observations were  
done on June 22.094-22.161 UT (4.14-5.75 hours post burst) with a  
total exposure time of 22x240s. The candidates reported by Levan et  
al. (GCNC 9547) and Galeev (GCNC 9549) are preliminarily detected at  
I~22.5 and I~20.6, respectively, against USNO-B field stars."
