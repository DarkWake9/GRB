At 10:42:22.68 UTC (38542.68 s UT) on 29 April 2003, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2695, a long GRB.

The burst triggered FREGATE in the 30-400 keV energy band.  No
real-time localization was sent to the GCN, since the weak fluence of
the burst in the WXM energy band resulted in a location that did not
meet the criteria for automatic propagation, and which was, in fact,
incorrect.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a localization that was
reported in a GCN Notice at 12:34:28 UT, 112 minutes after the burst.
The WXM ground localization SNR was 6.  The localization can be
expressed as a 90% confidence rectangle, whose center is at:

WXM-Ground: R.A. = 12h 13m 18s, Dec. = -20d 51' 09" (J2000),

and whose corners lie at:

R.A. =  12h 13m 32s, Dec. = -21d 01' 55"
R.A. =  12h 12m 50s, Dec. = -20d 59' 56"
R.A. =  12h 13m 03s, Dec. = -20d 40' 26"
R.A. =  12h 13m 46s, Dec. = -20d 42' 22" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data produced a localization that was
reported in the same GCN notice.  The SXC ground localization SNR was
6.  The localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that
is 2 arcminutes in radius and is centered at:

R.A. = 12h 13m 06s, Dec. = -20d 56' 00" (J2000).

(The GCN Notice incorrectly reported the radius as 1 arcminute due to
operator error.)

The T_90 duration of the burst in the 30-400 keV band was > 14 s.
