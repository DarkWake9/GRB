(UA/LPL), Jennifer Andrews (UA) report:

We initiated observations of 12 fields (each 2.26 x 2.26 deg^2) within the
LVC localization region for the GW trigger S190425z (LVC Circ 24168)
starting on 2019-04-25 9:01 UT. SAGUARO* uses the 1.5m Catalina Sky Survey
telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ and its 5 deg^2 imager to tile the highest
probability regions of the LVC localization that are accessible from
southern Arizona in order to search for electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave events. The typical limiting magnitudes of single
pointings are G~21 mag (calibrated to Gaia DR2). Below are the field
centers observed. Any interesting transient candidates will be reported as
soon as possible.
