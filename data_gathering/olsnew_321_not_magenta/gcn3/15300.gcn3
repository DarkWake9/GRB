report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 06:55:06.99 UT on 2 October 2013, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 131002A (trigger 402389709 / 131002288) which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Barlow et al. 2008, GCN 15283). GBM 
triggered ~46 sec later than Swift/BAT on the second pulse of the GRB.
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 128.2 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90) of 
about 12 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.096 s to
T0+4.096 s is
well fit by a simple power law function with index -1.6 +/- 0.1 keV. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.4 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0 -2.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 2.1 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
