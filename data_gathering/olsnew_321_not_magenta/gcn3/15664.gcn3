Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140103A (trigger #582773)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 15656).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 232.114, 37.752 deg which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  15h 28m 27.2s 
  Dec(J2000) = +37d 45' 08.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks.  The first weak peak starts 
at ~T-13 sec, peaks at ~T-11 sec and ends at ~T-6 sec.  The second peak starts 
at ~T-4 sec, peaks at ~T+1 sec and ends at ~T+9 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 
17.3 +- 1.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-12.52 to T+6.94 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.6 +- 0.2.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.0 +- 0.7 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.39 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.1 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
