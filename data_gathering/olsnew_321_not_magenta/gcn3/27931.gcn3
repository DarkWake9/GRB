M. Ohno (Hiroshima Univ.), M. Kovacevic (INFN Perugia), E. Bissaldi
(Politecnico & INFN Bari), M. Axelsson (KTH & Stockholm Univ.) and F. Longo
(University and INFN, Trieste) report on behalf of the Fermi-LAT
Collaboration:

On June 13, 2020, Fermi-LAT detected high-energy emission from
GRB 200613A, which was also detected by Fermi-GBM at T0 = 05:30:08 UT (GCN
27926, Bissaldi et al. GCN 27930).

The GRB is detected at high energy (>100 MeV) by Fermi-LAT at a location
of:

RA, Dec = 153.03, 45.85 (degrees, J2000) with an error radius of 0.14 deg
(90% containment, statistical error only).

This was ~29 deg from the LAT boresight when observations started, and is
~5.9 deg from the GBM final ground position.

The photon flux above 100 MeV in the time interval 0 - 10.000 s after the
GBM trigger is 6.6e-07 +/- 3.6e-07 ph/cm2/s.

The estimated photon index above 100 MeV is -1.73 +/- 0.36. The
highest-energy photon is a 7.6 GeV event which is observed ~6.2 ks after
the GBM trigger.

A Swift ToO has been approved for this burst.

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Masanori Ohno (
ohno@astro.hiroshima-u.ac.jp).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover
the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.
It is the product of an international collaboration between
NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
