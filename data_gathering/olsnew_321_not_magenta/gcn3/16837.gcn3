S. R. Oates (IAA-CSIC/UCL-MSSL) and M.E. Gropp (PSU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 140919A
3125 s after the BAT trigger (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 16831).
A fading source consistent with the optical and enhanced XRT position
(Schmidl et al. GCN Circ. 16836; Beardmore et al., GCN Circ 16834)
is detected in the initial UVOT exposures. Initial identification 
was complicated by the presence of a point source in the 
DSS close to the optical position. Photometry is therefore also 
complicated by the presence of this point source. 

Preliminary detections using the UVOT photometric system
(Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the early exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.09 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
