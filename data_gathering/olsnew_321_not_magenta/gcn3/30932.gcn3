IKI FuN:

We observed the field of Swift/BAT trigger  1078701 (Bernardini  et al., 
GCN 30929) with AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy), ZTSh 
telescope of CrAO, and AS-32 telescope of Abastumani observatory. The 
error circle of BAT localization was fully covered in all our 
observations.  In the first epoch of observations started on Oct. 10 
(UT) 11:32:39 (about 50 minutes after trigger) within BAT localization 
circle (Bernardini  et al., GCN 30929) we identified only one objects 
which is absent in  PS1 catalogue. The coordinates of the object are 
(J2000) 19:08:08.59  29:50:12.7 with uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec in both 
coordinates.  The brightness of the object in R-filter in a stacked 
image is R=21.13 +/- 0.19. The object is not present in following epochs 
of our observations.  Preliminary photometry of the object and upper 
limits in stacked images are following

The photometry is based on the nearby USNO-B1.0 stars
USNO-B1.0    R2

1198-0327174 17.81

The power law index of light curve of the object between the detection 
epoch and deep non-detection is less than -1.7 and do not contradict the 
typical light curve of GRBs. We could suggest the object as a 
counterpart of of GRB which might have been registered by Swift as the 
trigger 1078701.
