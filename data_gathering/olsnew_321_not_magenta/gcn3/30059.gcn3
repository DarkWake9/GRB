The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 19:07:02 UT on 20 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210520A (trigger 643230427.939988 / 210520797).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 147.9, Dec = -67.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 09h 51m, -67d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 3.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 15.0 degrees.
