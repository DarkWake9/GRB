B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift team.

Swift took a second epoch of data for the LAT/IPN GRB 150202B (Axelsson et al. GCN Circ. 17385, Hurley et al. GCN Circ. 17398) between T+515.2 ks and T+516.4 ks, with a 1.2 ks exposure time. 
Of the two unknown sources reported by Sbarufatti et al. (GCN 17405), Source #2 is still detected at a level of 8.4E-3 counts/s (3.7E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-2), comparable with the previous observation, while Source #1 has faded below detection, to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.8E-3 counts/s (1.6E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1).
We therefore confirm that Source #1 is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 150202B.

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the likely afterglow
