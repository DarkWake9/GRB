Alicia Soderberg (Harvard/SAO) and Dale Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of 
a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 081007 (GCN 8330) with the Very Large Array 
beginning at Oct 9.19 UT.  At 8.46 GHz we detect a radio source 
coincident with the optical afterglow position at coordinates (J2000):

RA =  22 39 50.3882   +/-  0.0009
Dec = -40 08 49.18    +/-  0.03

with flux density 0.32 +- 0.03 mJy.  Further observations are scheduled.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
