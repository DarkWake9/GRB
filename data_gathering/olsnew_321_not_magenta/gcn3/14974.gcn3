MESSENGER (GRNS), INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Fermi-GBM, and Konus-Wind have detected
GRB 130702A (= Fermi 394416326) so far.  We have triangulated this burst to an
annulus centered at RA, Dec (2000) = 293.0106 degrees, -18.3126 degrees,
whose radius is 82.0991 +/- 0.4594 degrees (3 sigma).  The distance
between the annulus center line and the iPTF optical transient reported
by Singer et al. (GCN 14967) is 0.16 degrees, strengthening the association
of the transient with the GRB.  A map has been posted at 
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/130702 showing the annulus, the Fermi LAT position
(GCN 14971), and the optical transient.  This localization may be
improved.
