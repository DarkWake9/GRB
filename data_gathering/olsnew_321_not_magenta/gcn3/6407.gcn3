collaboration report:

We observed optical afterglow  of GRB070419A (Stamatikos et al, GCN 6302;
Chornock et al. GCN 6304) with 1.5m telescope of  Maidanak observatory
(MAO).  Several exposures in R-band in seeing ~1 arcsec were obtained on
Apr. 17 between (UT) 15:20 - 16:25.  In a combined image the source at
(J2000) RA= 12 10 58.83 DEC= +39 55 34.06 with an error in both coordinates
of 0.15" is compatible with the coordinates of Chornock et al. (GCN 6304)
and Garnavich et al. (GCN 6406).

A photometry of the afterglow using USNO-A2.0 stars  is following:

T0+ ,      Exposure,  R_mag

0.245 d   11x300 s     22.4 +/- 0.3

Our observation is compatible with global power law decay index 0.9
(Garnavich et al. GCN 6406) suggesting no host galaxy contribution in epoch
of our observation.
