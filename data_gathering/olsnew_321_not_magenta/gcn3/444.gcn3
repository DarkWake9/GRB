D. A. Frail (NRAO) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"Beginning 1999 November 7.34 UT we imaged the field of GRB 991106,
centered on the refined BeppoSAX position (GCN #435) with the Very
Large Array (VLA). A frequency of 8.46 GHz was used, which provides a
field-of-view of 5.3 arcmin to half power (FWHM). A quick-look
analysis of the data shows a single unresolved source near the western
edge of the WFC error circle at R.A.= 22 24 27.65, dec.=+54 21 53.0
(J2000), with conservative errors of 1 arcsec in each dimension. The
probability of detecting an unrelated background source in the WFC
error circle is not insignificant (~10%). Further radio observations
are underway to determine whether the source is variable or not."
