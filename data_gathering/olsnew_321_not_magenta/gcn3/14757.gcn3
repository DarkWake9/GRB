GRB GTO collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of the short-duration GRB 130603B
(Melandri et al., GCN 14735; Levan et al., GCN 14742; de Ugarte
Postigo et al., GCN 14743) using the ESO VLT equipped with the
X-shooter spectrograph. The observations started on 2013-06-04 at
00:00:28 UT (i.e., 8.187 hr after the burst). A total exposure of
4x600 s was obtained, covering the spectral range from ~300 to ~2100
nm.

A continuum is detected in all the UVB/VIS/NIR arms of the spectra. We
identify several absorption features which we interpret as Ca II H & K
and Mg II from the optical afterglow, as well as emission lines such
as the [O II] doublet, [O III], H-alpha, H-beta, and [S II] from the
host galaxy, all at a common redshift of z=0.3564+/-0.0002, fully
consistent with the measurements by Thoene et al. (GCN 14744), Foley
et al. (GCN 14745), and Sanchez-Ramirez et al. (GCN 14747).

We thank the Paranal staff for enthusiastic support, in particular
Cedric Ledoux and Alex Correa.
