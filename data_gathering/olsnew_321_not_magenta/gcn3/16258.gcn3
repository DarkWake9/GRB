Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140512A (trigger #598819)
(Pagani, et al., GCN Circ. 16249).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 289.366, -15.087 deg which is
    RA(J2000)  =  19h 17m 27.9s
    Dec(J2000) = -15d 05' 14.8"
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 35%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a complex structure.  The first group of 
multiple peaks begins at ~T-15 sec, reaches maximum at T+0 sec, and returns to 
background by ~T+40 sec.  Then a second longer, brighter group of multiple peaks 
begins at ~T+85 sec, reaches maximum at T+120 sec and falls to background by 
T+170 sec. T90 (15-350 keV) is 154.8 +- 4.88 sec (estimated error including 
systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-22.84 to T+186.29 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.45 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 
erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+121.96 sec in the 15-150 keV 
band is 6.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence 
level.
