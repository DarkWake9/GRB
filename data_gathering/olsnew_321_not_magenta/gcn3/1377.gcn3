P.A. Price, B.P. Schmidt (RSAA, ANU) and T.S. Axelrod (Arizona) report:

We have observed the error box of GRB 020418 (GCN #1376) with the robotic
MSO 50-inch telescope + MACHO imager at 2002 Apr 19.42 UT (approximately
25.5 hours after the GRB) with 3 x 300 sec exposures.  The combined image
covers the entire error box down to a limiting magnitude of R ~ 21.1 mag,
based on comparison with USNO-A2.0 magnitudes.  We do not find any
convincing afterglow candidate upon visual comparison with the second
Digitised Sky Survey down to the plate limit, R ~ 20.5 mag.

Further observations are planned.
