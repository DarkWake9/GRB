SUBJECT: GRB 060110: ROTSE-III Confirmation of Optical Counterpart

W. Rujopakarn (U Mich), T.A. McKay (U Mich), F. Yuan (U Mich), H. Swan 
(U Mich), D.A. Smith (Guilford), S. A. Yost (U Mich) report on behalf 
of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIb, located at McDonald Observatory, Texas, responded to GRB 
060110 (Zane al. GCN 4463). The first image was at 08:01:44.8 UT, 27.1 
s after the burst (9 s after the GCN notice time). Imaging is shallow 
due to the brightness of the Moon. The unfiltered images are calibrated 
relative to USNO A2.0 R-band. We detect the source reported by Bloom 
(GCN 4471) near the limiting magnitude of the early coadded exposures. 
It was ~15.5 mag at about 50 s post-trigger, in an image at limiting 
magnitude 16.0

Further data analyses are in progress.
