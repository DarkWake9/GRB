Report on behalf of the 1M2H and the UC-NASA-Keck collaborations:

In the process of searching the localization region of LIGO/Virgo
S190814bv (LIGO/Virgo Collaboration, GCN #25324), we obtained
30-second J-band exposures of the following regions with the
Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on
the Keck I telescope on Maunakea. Observations began at approximately
UT 2019-08-15 13:10. The field of view is roughly 6.1'x6.1'. The
approximate center of each image is noted in the table below.

The first two fields correspond to the fields of DESGW candidates
AT2019nme and AT2019nmd, respectively (GCN #25336). The remaining
fields were prioritized according to the relative probability of
potential host galaxies (Coulter et al. 2017, Science, 358, 1556).

Visually inspecting our images and comparing to PS1 and DECaLS
images of the same fields, we did not detect any sources in J-band
at the expected location of the candidates reported in GCN #25324,
nor did we detect any sources without optical counterparts with a
limiting magnitude of J~20 mag.
