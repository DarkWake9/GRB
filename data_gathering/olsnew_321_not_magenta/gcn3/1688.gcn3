The entire HETE-2 error box for GRB 021113 (GCN 1686) was imaged with the
KPNO 4-m telescope and Mosaic imager, beginning on 13th November 10:48
UT (4.17 hours after burst). 2 R-band images were obtained, dithered to
cover chip gaps. The total exposure time was 840 s.

Visual comparison with the DSS-2(R) reveals no obvious new sources.
