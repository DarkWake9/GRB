(NAO/CAS) report on behalf of the Gravitational Wave Follow-Up Network
by NAO-PMO-XAO-YNAO in China (GWFUNC):

We observed the transient, PS17yt, in Chambers et al. (GCN 20512) using the
Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) 2.4-m telescope at Lijiang, Yunan, China. The
photometric observation began at 18:35:37 UT on 2017-01-24, and 1x600 s
imaging was obtained in the Sloan r-filter . The object was well
detected with the magnitude of m(r) = 18.76 ¡À 0.04 mag, calibrated with
nearby SDSS stars. Together with the previous measurements in GCN 20512,
it indicates that the object has been rising relatively slowly, being
more consistent with the behavior of early SN Ia than those of other
types of early SNe, in agreement with its spectroscopic classification
of SN Ia in Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 20521).
