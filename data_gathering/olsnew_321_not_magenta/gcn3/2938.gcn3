P. B. Cameron (Caltech) and S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report:

"We have carried out a more thorough calibration of the three VLA
epochs of the fading radio source toward SGR 1806-20 (GCN#s 2928,
2929, 2930, 2933, 2934, 2935). Combining this with the data from a
fourth epoch observation made with the Australia Compact Array (GCN#
2937) we do a joint fit of the form: F_nu \propto t^\alpha nu^\beta.

The best fit values are alpha= -1.62+/-0.06 and beta=-0.75+/-0.03.

There is evidence of deviations from this simple power-law behavior.
Fitting the decay rate alpha at each frequency we find a systematic
steepening. The value of alpha is -1.0 at 1.4 GHz, -1.5 at 4.9 GHz,
and -2.2 at 8.5 GHz. This behavior is reminiscent of the broadband
afterglow of GRB 991216 (Frail et al. ApJ, 538, 129). A plot of the
light curves is at: http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~dfrail/sgr1806lc.eps.
