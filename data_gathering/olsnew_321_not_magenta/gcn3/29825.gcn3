We searched for the optical counterpart of GRB 210413B (A. Tohuvavohu et
al. GCN #29819, and P. A. Evans et al., GCN #29821) with the 1-m class
telescope in Lemonsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (LOAO), one of
facilities of the GW EM-Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO).

We observed the center of Swift/BAT localization (RA, Dec = 182.558 +55.965),
but could not find any transient within the field of view of LOAO
(28.1'x28.1'). We calibrated flux with the PS1 catalog and used an AB
magnitude system.
