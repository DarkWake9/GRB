Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 141130A (trigger #620090)
(Vargas, et al., GCN Circ. 17120).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 222.804, 47.323 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 51m 13.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +47d 19' 24.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 73%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows the burst starting at ~T-43 sec, going
flat until ~T-10 sec, then peaking at ~T-2 sec, and then returing
to baseline ~T+60 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 62.9 +- 11.4 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-42.75 to T+40.02 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.56 +- 0.08.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-4.69 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
