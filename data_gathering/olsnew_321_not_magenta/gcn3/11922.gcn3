At 07:33:21 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 110412A (trigger=451191).  Swift did not slew to the location
because the position is in an observing constraint.  The BAT on-board 
calculated location is RA, Dec 133.492, +13.517 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 08h 53m 58s
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 30' 60"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~600 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~20 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 15:08 UT on 2011 April 14. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is J. M. Gelbord (jgelbord AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
