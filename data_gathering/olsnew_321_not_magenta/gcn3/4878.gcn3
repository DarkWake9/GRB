Crain, A. Foster, J. Kirschbrown, C. MacLeod, and A. Trotter report on
behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

Skynet observed the localization of GRB 060313 (Pagani et al., GCN 4867)
with two of the 16-inch PROMPT telescopes at CTIO beginning 43.7 min after
the burst in r'i'I.

A preliminary analysis of the data shows the candidate afterglow first
reported by Levan & Hjorth (GCN 4871) to be at r' = 19.9 +- 0.3 and I =
19.7 +- 0.3 at mean times of 1.3 hours and 1.4 hours after the burst.
PROMPT also made a marginal detection (~2 sigma) of i' ~ 20.5 at a mean
time of 1.5 hours after the burst.  We used five calibration stars that
were taken from the USNO-B1.0 and NOMAD catalogues and transformed to the
SDSS filters via Smith et al. 2002.

PROMPT is currently being built and commissioned.
