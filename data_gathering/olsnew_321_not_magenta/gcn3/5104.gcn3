P.A. Price (IfA, Hawaii) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB 060510b (GCN #5098) with
the Gemini North telesecope + GMOS.  Observations consisted of 2 x 1000
sec exposures with the 400 lines/mm grating, with the source at an
airmass ~ 2.  Based on the presence of a strong continuum break around
7250A which we identify as due to Ly alpha, we estimate a redshift of z
= 4.9.


PAP thanks Nestor Mirabal for helpful discussion.  We also thank the
Gemini North observing team for performing these observations.
