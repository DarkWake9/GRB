TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline and E.
Mazets, on behalf of the Konus-WIND and NEAR GRB teams, and F.
Frontera, C. Guidorzi and E. Montanari, on behalf of the
BeppoSAX GRBM team, report:

Ulysses, Konus, NEAR, and SAX observed this burst at
33960 UT.  As observed by Ulysses, it had a duration of 
~7 s and a 25-100 keV fluence of 3.5 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2.
We have triangulated it to a preliminary error
box whose 3 sigma area is ~50 sq. arcmin. and whose coordinates
are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
  2 h 20 m 16.13 s    -14 o 50 '  14.33 "  (CENTER)
  2 h 20 m 15.19 s    -14 o 46 '  56.89 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 20 m 43.02 s    -14 o 37 '  01.35 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 19 m 49.16 s    -15 o 03 '  28.23 "  (CORNER)
  2 h 20 m 17.07 s    -14 o 53 '  31.81 "  (CORNER)

This error box can be improved.
