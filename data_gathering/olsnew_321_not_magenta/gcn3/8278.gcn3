Alexander van der Horst (NASA/ORAU) and Adam Goldstein (UAH) report on
behalf of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Team:

"We have performed spectral analysis of GRB 080916C (GCN 8245, 8246).
The time averaged spectrum, from 8 keV up to 30 MeV, of the main emission
up to 66 seconds after the burst is best fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 424 +/- 24 keV, alpha = -0.91 +/- 0.02, and beta = -2.08 +/- 0.06.
The fluence (8 keV - 30 MeV) is 1.9e-4 erg/cm^2.

These spectral analysis results are preliminary; the final results will
be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
