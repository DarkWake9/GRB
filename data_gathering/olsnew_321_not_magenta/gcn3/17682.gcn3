GRB 150407A: Swift detection of a possible burst

D. M. Palmer (LANL) reports on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 00:31:10, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) detected
a possible source, GRB 150407A (trigger=637342), with marginal
statistical significance, in two consecutive images of 6 minutes 
total duration.
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 216.603, 38.541 (J2000), which is 
  RA(J2000)  =  14h 26m 25s
  Dec(J2000) =  38d 32' 28"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is usual for image triggers, no obvious
variation is visible in the BAT lightcurve.

After ground discovery of this pair of possible detections, a ToO 
observation is planned to search for a counterpart afterglow.
See GCN#17681 for details.
