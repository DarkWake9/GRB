C. Clemens, A. Kupcu Yoldas, J. Greiner, A. Yoldas, T. Kruehler (all MPE 
Garching) and G. Szokoly (Eoetvoes Univ., Budapest and MPE Garching) report 
on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 080330 (Swift trigger 308041; Mao et al., GCN 
#7537) simultaneously in g', r', i', z', J, H and K with GROND (Greiner et 
al. 2008, PASP) mounted at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at La Silla Observatory 
(Chile).

Observations started at 03:44:23 UT on March, 30th, 2008, about 3.1 mins after 
the GRB trigger. We found a bright point source at

RA (J2000.0) = 11h 17m 04.48s
DEC (J2000.0) = 30d 37' 24.4'',

coincident with the optical afterglow first reported by Klotz et al. (GCN 
#7536 and #7543).

Based on the first 240 s of effective exposures in J and H, we estimate 
magnitudes of

J=15.92 +/- 0.02 and H=15.45 +/- 0.01,

calibrated against 2MASS stars.
