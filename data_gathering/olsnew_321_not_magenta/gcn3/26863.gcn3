The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Graham et al. 2019, Bellm et al. 2019) has repeatedly observed the location of nine X-ray sources, found with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift), that Evans et al. (GCN #26855) reported as candidate counterparts to S200115j (GCN #26759, GCN #26807) with rank = 2.

We searched the ZTF alert database using Kowalski (Duev et al., 2019). We found that only the Swift source S200115j_X136 has a ZTF alert within the spatial uncertainty indicated in GCN #26855. The ZTF source, labelled ZTF20aafapey, was found on 2020-01-13 (before the detection of S200115j) and it is located on top of the nucleus of the galaxy 2MASS 02401222-0233442 at redshift z=0.04333 (6dF Galaxy Survey; Jones et al., 2009). We performed forced photometry of ZTF20aafapey using ForcePhotZTF (Yao et al., 2019). The light curve (Table 1) shows rapid variability days before S200115j, with a significant brightening of >0.5 mag on 2020-01-13. Our results are in agreement with Oates et al. (GCN #26808) and further suggest that S200115j_X136/ZTF20aafapey is caused by AGN activity. We conclude that S200115j_X136 is unlikely associated with S200115j.

For other Swift X-ray sources no ZTF alerts were issued, although the transient candidate locations were recently observed in most cases. In Table 2 we report ZTF detection upper limits at the approximate location of the Swift sources - other than S200115j_X136 - from 2020-01-13 to 2020-01-22. The exposure times are provided in seconds.

Evans et al. (GCN #26855) recommended the investigation of three sources in particular: S200115j_X136, S200115j_X707, and S200115j_X746. A discussion on S200115j_X136 is presented above. The coordinates of both S200115j_X707 and S200115j_X746 were observed with ZTF 2 days before S200115j, 2-3 hours after S200115j, and 3 days after S200115j. The non-detection of counterparts in ZTF data well constrains the presence of a bright optical transient evolving on hours to days timescales associated with S200115j_X707 or S200115j_X746. Further follow-up is encouraged.
