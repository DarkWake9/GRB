A. Goldstein (USRA), R. Hamburg (UAH), and C.M. Hui (NASA/MSFC) report on
behalf of the Fermi GBM team:

â€œWe have searched the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for gamma-ray
counterpart to IceCube-190124A (GCN 23785). The closest onboard trigger
occurred approximately 1 hour prior to the neutrino event time and was
identified as a terrestrial gamma-ray flash unassociated with the neutrino.
The ground-based untargeted search of GBM data did not find any significant
candidates within +/- 1 hour of the event time. The targeted search
([1],[2]) was also run +/- 150 s around the event time, and no significant
candidates were found.

We set the following impulsive 3 sigma flux upper limits (10-1000 keV) in a
300 s window around the neutrino time based on various GRB spectra, ranging
from soft to hard spectra.

Timescale  Upper limit (erg/s/cm^2)
-----------------------------------
1 s  :      1.6 -  7.5 (e-07)
10 s :      5.0 - 23.4 (e-08)
100 s:      1.6 -  7.5 (e-08)
