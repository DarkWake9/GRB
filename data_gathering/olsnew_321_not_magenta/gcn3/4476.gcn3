Using the data set from T-299.2 to T+302.9 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060109 
(trigger #176620)  (De Pasquale, et al., GCN 4455).  
The BAT ground-calculated position 
is (RA,Dec) = 282.739, 32.009 {18h 50m 57.3s, 32d 0' 32.6"} (deg; J2000) 
+- 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  
The partial coding was 92%. 

The mask-tagged lightcurve shows a double peak structure.  The first peak has 
a duration of ~20 sec. starting from T-2 sec.  And the second peak has 
a duration of ~40 sec. starting from T+75 sec. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is (116 +- 3) sec (estimated error including systematics).

Over the full burst interval (T-0.4 to T+126.8 sec), the power law index of 
the time-averaged spectrum is 1.96 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV 
band is (6.4 +- 1.0) x 10^-07 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
from T+90.19 sec in the 15-150 keV band is (0.5 +- 0.1) ph/cm2/sec.  
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
