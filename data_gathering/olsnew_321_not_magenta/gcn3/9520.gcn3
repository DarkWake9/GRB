We have been monitoring the field of GRB090618 (Swift trigger 355083),
with the Faulkes Telescope North (Hawaii), starting ~80 minutes after
the trigger time (Schady et al. GCN 9512).

Observations were performed with BVRi filters. The optical afterglow
reported by Cenko (GCN 9513), Perley (GCN 9514) and Rujopakarn et al.
(GCN  9515) is clearly visible and detected in all filters.
We find a magnitude of R=17.01 ± 0.03 (at 2.5 hrs after the burst)
and R=17.25 ± 0.05 (at 3.1 hrs). We confirm the decay of alpha~0.7
reported by Li et al. (GCN 9517).

Observations are continuing.
