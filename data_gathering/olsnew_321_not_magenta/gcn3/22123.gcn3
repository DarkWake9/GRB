report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 20:50:17.15 UT on 12 November 2017, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 171112A (trigger 532212622 / 171112868)
which was also detected by the MAXI/GSC (Sugita et al. 2017, GCN 22118)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the MAXI position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 99
degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple episodes
with a duration (T90) of about 145 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-45.44 s to T0+104.07 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.49 +/- 0.06 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 198 +/- 38 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.75 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.73 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 6.50 +/- 0.31 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
