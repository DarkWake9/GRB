A. Dressler (Carnegie), A. Diercks, R. Gal, S. Yost, J. Bloom, and
F. Harrison (Caltech) report:

"We imaged the entire error circle of GRB000424 (Piro et al., GCN #644)
with the COSMIC instrument on the Palomar 200" telescope at April
26.12 UT.  Exposures consisted of 3x600s images in R-band with
approximately 1.3" seeing FWHM.  Visual comparison with a photographic
f-band (approximate R-band) image from the DPOSS survey reveals no new
objects to the detection limit of the plate (approximately R ~ 20.7)."
