Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 061222A (trigger #252588)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 5954).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA, Dec = 358.258, 46.527 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 53m  1.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = 46d 31' 37.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 70%.
 
The mask-weighted lightcurve shows the emision starting at T-100 sec
with a small peak at T_zero, and then a 10-sec FRED peak starting at T+25 sec.
It is followed by two 10-sec peaks at T+50 and T+65 sec; then a large peak
at T+88 sec with a FWHM of ~12 sec and the emission returns to background
at T+115 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 72 +- 3 sec (estimated error including
systematics).  At this time, there is a gap in the downlinked data
from T-180 sec to T-110.  A further Circular will be issued if there is
burst activity in this interval.
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.5 to T+117.7 is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.39 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+86.54 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 9.2 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
