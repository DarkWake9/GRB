M. Capalbi, M. Perri (ASDC), D.N. Burrows (PSU),
T. Sakamoto (NASA/ORAU) report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analysed the first 8 orbits of XRT data from GRB 060717
(Sakamoto et al., GCN 5326). A Photon Counting mode image (11 ks)
provides a refined XRT position:

RA(J2000)  = 11h 23m 21.79s
Dec(J2000) = +28d 57m 03.3s

with an uncertainty of 4.5 arcsec (90% containment). This position is 0.7
arcsec away from the XRT position quoted in Capalbi et al. (GCN 5331).

The 0.3-10 keV X-ray light curve shows a power law decline with a
decay index of -0.9 ± 0.2.

There are only 56 counts, insufficient for spectral analysis. Assuming
a photon index of 2.0 and the Galactic value for the column density
(1.4e20 cm^-2), the estimated unabsorbed source flux at T+24h is
about 3e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

This circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.
