report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered ground by a short
bright burst, GRB 211024A, at 2021-10-24T01:34:11.450 UTC (denoted as T0),
which was also detected by Fermi/GBM (GCN 30962).
According to the GECAM-B light curves in about 16-3500 keV, this 
burst mainly consists of a broad pulse with a duration of about 0.1 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000):
Ra: 25.7 deg 
Dec: 1.05 deg
Err: 28.73 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees 
which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

This location is consistent with Fermi/GBM position within the error.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
