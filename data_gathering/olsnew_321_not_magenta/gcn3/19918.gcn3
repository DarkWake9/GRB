N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), A. J. Levan (U. Warwick),
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 160912A (Cannizzo et al.
GCN 19912) with the 2m Liverpool Telescope on La Palma
with the IO:O camera.

Images were obtained in the r and i filters at two epochs,
each exposure being 25 mins in total. Within the revised
X-ray error circle (Beardmore et al. GCN 19915) we find a
point source with the following provisional magnitudes 
and start times relative to the BAT trigger time:

epoch1 dt=17053s i=22.10+/-0.15
epoch1 dt=18664s r=22.77+/-0.20
epoch2 dt=29285s i=22.57+/-0.17
epoch2 dt=30897s r=23.11+/-0.21

Given the evidence for fading, we conclude this is likely
the optical afterglow of the GRB.

The J2000 position of the source is 20:05:59.68 +57:33:54.9
to an accuracy of about 0.5".
