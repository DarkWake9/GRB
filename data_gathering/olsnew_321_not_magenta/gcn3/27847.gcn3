WeiKang Zheng and Alexei V. Filippenko (UC Berkeley) report on
behalf of the KAIT GRB team:

The 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), located at
Lick Observatory, observed the field of GRB 200529A (GBM detection:
GCN 27844; Swift detection: D'Elia et al., GCN 27845), starting at
~5.25 hours after the burst. We obtained 23x60s images in the clear
(roughly R) filter. We marginally detect, therefore confirm the
optical afterglow reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 27846) in our
co-added image. We estimate the afterglow to be 21.2 +/- 0.2 magnitude
in clear filter, calibrated to PS1 catalog.
