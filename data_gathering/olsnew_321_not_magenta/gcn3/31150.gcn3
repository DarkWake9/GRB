report on behalf of GECAM team:

During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered by a short burst, 
GRB 211106A, at 2021-11-06T04:37:31.250 UTC (denoted as T0), which was 
also observed by Swift/BAT-GUANO (GCN #31049), Fermi/GBM Sub-Threshold
(GCN #31055), Konus-Wind (GCN #31054), INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (TrigID #9504)
and IPN (GCN #31078).

According to the GECAM-B light curves, this burst mainly consists of 
two pulses with duration of about 2 s.

The GECAM light curve could be found here:
http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/gecamb_lc_grd_89872651.PNG

GECAM location is consistent with the Swift/BAT position within the error.

The time-integrated spectrum (measured from T0-0.25 s to T0+1.85 s) 
is best fit by the power law model (in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range):
A(E) ~ k * E^(-alpha) with alpha = 1.32 (-0.13, 0.15).
The burst had a fluence of 6.35 (3.72, 7.05)x10^-7 erg/cm^2 (20 - 200 keV)
during the time interval metioned above. 
All parameters in parenthesis are for 90% confidence level.

Please note that all GECAM results here are preliminary. The final analysis
will be published in journal papers or GECAM online catalog.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in
Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time),
which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
