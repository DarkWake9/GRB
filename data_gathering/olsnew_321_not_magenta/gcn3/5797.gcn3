on behalf of EAFON team report:

"We have performed optical observations using Lulin 1-m telescope for
GRB 061110 from 51 min after the burst. We found a optical afterglow
candidate of GRB 061110 located at RA = 22:25:09.8 Dec = -02:15:30 in
our R and I band images. The source does not appear in DSS-II
images. Our quick analysis indicates that the brightness of this
source shows about 0.2 mag fading between 51 min and 85 min after the
burst.

Further deeply observations are encouraged."
