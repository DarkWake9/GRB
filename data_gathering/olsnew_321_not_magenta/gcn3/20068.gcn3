report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

At 17:52:08.26 UT on 17 October 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 161017A (trigger 498419532/161017745), 
which was also detected by Swift (Troja et al., GCN 20064).  
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 125 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows two peaks with a duration (T90) 
of about 32 s (50-300 keV).  The time-averaged spectrum 
from T0-22.1 s to T0+8.6 s is adequately fit by a power law function 
with an exponential high-energy cutoff.  
The power law index is -1.04 +/- 0.09 and the cutoff energy, 
parameterized as Epeak, is 298.50 +/- 45.00 keV

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
 (7.02 +/- 0.43)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+4.3 s in the 10-1000keV band is 5.6 +/- 0.5 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.
