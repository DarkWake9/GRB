GRB 110808B, a very intense short-duration, hard spectrum GRB,
was observed by Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey, MESSENGER, and RHESSI at
56693 s UT.  We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
box whose area is about 108 square arcminutes, whose maximum dimension
is ~22 arcminutes, and whose coordinates are:
             RA(2000)                         Dec(2000)
CENTER:   266.1808=17 h 44 m 43.4 s    -37.7463=-37 o 44 '  47 "
CORNERS:  266.0492=17 h 44 m 11.8 s    -37.7586=-37 o 45 '  31 "   
          266.3453=17 h 45 m 22.9 s    -37.8732=-37 o 52 '  24 "     
          266.0166=17 h 44 m 04.0 s    -37.6169=-37 o 37 '  01 "     
          266.3123=17 h 45 m 14.9 s    -37.7332=-37 o 44 '  00 "

Although this error box lies at Galactic latitude -5 degrees, it does
not include any of the known magnetars.  A Swift ToO has been requested.
Further details of the spectrum and time history will appear in a
forthcoming GCN Circular.  A map is posted at
ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/110808B.  This error box can be improved.
