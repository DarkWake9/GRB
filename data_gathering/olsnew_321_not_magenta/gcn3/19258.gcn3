“Further to GCNCs 19145, 18848, 18811 and 18786, we report the 
spectroscopic follow-up of the Pan-STARRS transient PS15dpn within the 
localisation region of G211117. OSIRIS spectra (2 x 600s) at the 10.4m 
GTC in La Palma were taken on 5 Jan 2016 and covered the range 700-1000 
nm. r-band photometric observations were performed near-simultaneously 
to the optical spectroscopy.  We confirm the z=0.1749 redshift from the 
host galaxy based on the detection of H-alpha and NII emission lines in 
this range.”
