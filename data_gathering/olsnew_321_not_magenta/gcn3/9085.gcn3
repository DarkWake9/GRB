The bright long GRB090401A (Swift/BAT trigger #348128; Schady et al., 
GCN 9062; Sato et al., GCN 9064) was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band 
All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV 
at 00:02:34.509 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure lasting from 
T0-5s to T0+38s.  There is also a weak precursor starting at ~T0-103s, 
 resulting in the total duration (T90) of about 112 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.37(-0.10,+0.08) x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+27s was 5.1(-0.4,+0.5) photons/cm^2/s
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0-5s to
T0+38s is fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.14 (-0.13,+0.14) (chi^2/d.o.f = 21.4/24).
3 % systematic errors were included in low energy channels. 
All the quoted errors are at 90% confidence level. 

The light curves with 1-sec time resolution for this burst will be appeared at:
