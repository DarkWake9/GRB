The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

On 2022-06-24 at 16:13:16.41 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_GOLD alert stream. The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 0.173 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/136766_7637140.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Date: 2022-06-24
Time:  16:13:16.41 UT
RA: 224.12 (+2.23, -1.95 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000
Dec: 41.31 (+1.56, -1.56 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000

We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

There are no Fermi 4FGL or 3FHL catalog sources in the 90% uncertainty region. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL J1504.6+4343 at RA: 226.16 deg, Dec: 43.72 deg (2.84 deg away from the best-fit event position).

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
