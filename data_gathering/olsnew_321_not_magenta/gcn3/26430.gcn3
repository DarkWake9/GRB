Following on from Andreoni et al. (GCN 26424), we report previous
Pan-STARRS1 (Chambers et al. 2016) detections of transient
ZTF19acykzsk on 2019 December 12. We have 4 detections (PS19heq)
at the location of the transient (RA = 02:11:37.08, Dec = +34:02:28.8)
as detailed below, all in the PS1 w-band filter.  Two of the
detections are before the trigger time of S191213g and the other
two are from after the event. We therefore do not believe this
object is associated with the event.

Objects promoted in PS1 are automatically submitted to the TNS.  In
this case PS19heq was registered as AT2019wqj, but of course, we
acknowledge this as a ZTF discovery.  The TNS report was also
submitted after the GCN 26424 had been sent.
