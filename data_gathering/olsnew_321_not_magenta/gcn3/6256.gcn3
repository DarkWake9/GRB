D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) reports:

At the position of the possible X-ray afterglow (Troja, Page & 
McBreen, GCN 6255) of the short GRB 070406 (Cummings et 
al., GCN 6247), there is a bright galaxy (at least, it is flagged as 
such) detected in the SDSS at position (J2000):

RA = 13:15:51.6
Dec = +16:30:48.31

This is 3".75 away in RA and 1".41 in Dec. and thus within the 
error circle.

The (model) magnitudes are:

u' = 20.017  +/- 0.050
b' = 19.775  +/- 0.016
v' = 19.720  +/- 0.019
r' = 19.630  +/- 0.025
i' = 19.510  +/- 0.078

It is thus quite blue. Further X-ray observations should show if 
this is possibly only an AGN.

Spectroscopy of this galaxy is strongly encouraged.
