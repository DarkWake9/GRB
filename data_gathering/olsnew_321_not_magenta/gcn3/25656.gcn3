On behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaborations:

We again observed the localization region of the gravitational wave trigger S190901ap (LVC et al. GCN 25606, GCN 25614) with the Palomar 48-inch telescope equipped with the 47 square degree ZTF camera (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019). The tiling was optimally determined and triggered using the GROWTH Target of Opportunity marshal (Coughlin et al. 2019a, Kasliwal et al. 2019b). We started our new target-of-opportunity observations in the g-band and r-band beginning at UT 2019-09-04 10:18 UT. Each exposure was 30s, with a typical median depth of 20.8 mag in g band and 20.6 mag in r band. Across the three nights of observations (Kool et al. GCN 25616, Stein et al. GCN 25634), we have covered 73% of the enclosed probability at least once, and 67% of the enclosed probability at least twice. This estimate does not account for chip gaps.

The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We rejected stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, applied machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019), and removed candidates with history of variability prior to the merger time. Two additional candidates were found by our pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZTF19abwsmmd | 22.666409  | -19.712405 | r      | 20.08 | 0.22

ZTF19abwsmmd has a blue color (g - r ~ -0.25) and is located in a compact host galaxy with a SDSS photo z of ~0.05, consistent with the merger distance. It was not detected in g band on Aug 30 UT to a depth of 20.4 mag. ZTF19abwvals is red (g - r ~ 0.5), located in a host galaxy with an SDSS photo-z of ~0.13. It was not detected in g band on Sep 1 UT to a depth of 20.64. We encourage spectroscopic and photometric observations to discern the nature of these candidates.
