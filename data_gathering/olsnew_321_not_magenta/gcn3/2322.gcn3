At 11:46:24.82 UTC (42384.82 s UT) on 25 July 2003, the HETE FREGATE 
and WXM instruments detected  GRB030725 (=H2779), a bright, 
double-peaked long GRB located at high galactic latitude (b = 37 
degrees).

The burst triggered Fregate in the 5-120 keV energy band. A GCN burst 
alert was issued 2.6 m later. Because the source was located at the 
extreme edge of the FOV of the WXM Y counter, no flight localization 
was derived. Ground analysis of the WXM data provided a localization 
that was reported in a GCN Notice at 13:19:34 UT. The WXM 
localization can be expressed as a 90% confidence error region that 
is centered at:

WXM Center-ground:   RA= 20h 33m 34s,  Dec= -50d 45' 30"  (J2000)

The WXM error region is unusually elongated because of the very low 
exposure of the Y detector. The four corners of the WXM error region 
are located at J2000 coordinates:

WXM_CORNER1:    	RA= 20h 33m 53.3s, Dec= -51d 00' 04"
WXM_CORNER2:    	RA= 20h 33m 15.3s, Dec= -50d 59' 02"
WXM_CORNER3:    	RA= 20h 33m 15.1s, Dec= -50d 30' 58"
WXM_CORNER4:    	RA=	20h 33m 52.8s, Dec= -50d 31' 59"

Ground analysis of the SXC data provided a better localization that 
was disseminated as a GCN notice at 16:07:46 UT. The SXC localization 
can be expressed as a 90% confidence error region that is centered at:

SXC Center-Ground:   RA= 20h 33m 47s , Dec= -50d 45' 49"  (J2000)

The SXC X camera detected the burst, but the SXC Y camera did not. We 
were able to use the WXM Y localization to constrain the SXC error 
region in the Y direction. The four corners of the SXC error region 
are located at J2000 coordinates:

SXC_CORNER1:    RA= 20h 33m 36.5s, Dec= -50d 59' 35"
SXC_CORNER2:    RA= 20h 33m 57.3s, Dec= -51d 00' 11"
SXC_CORNER3:    RA= 20h 33m 56.6s, Dec= -50d 32' 06"
SXC_CORNER4:    RA= 20h 33m 35.7s, Dec= -50d 31' 30"

H2779 was comprised by two FRED-like* peaks, separated by ~160s. The 
duration of the first peak was ~40s, while that of the second peak 
was ~10s. A total of 25000 counts were detected in the 7-30 keV 
energy band during the ~180s interval encompassing both peaks, 
corresponding to a fluence of ~5 x 10-6 ergs cm-2. The peak flux 
was >2 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie >5 x Crab flux) in the same energy 
band. [* FRED = Fast rise, exponential decay]

In the 30-400 keV band, the fluence was ~2 x 10-5 ergs cm-2, which is 
~4 times the fluence in the 7-30 keV band. Thus, H2779 appears to be 
a "classical" long hard burst.
