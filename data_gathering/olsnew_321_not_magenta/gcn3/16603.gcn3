We observed the position of GRB 140713A (GCN 16581) at 15 GHz with
the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI-LA) starting on 2014 July 16.88
to 17.05 UT, corresponding to 3.1 days post-burst. We have detected the
radio counterpart (GCN 16593) with a preliminary flux of 0.66 +/- 0.07 mJy.


Earlier observations were conducted on 2014 July 13.78 to 13.87 UT and
July 14.79 to 14.96 UT, corresponding to <5 minutes and 1 day post-burst,
yielding a 3 sigma flux upper limit of 0.24 mJy and marginal detection of
0.18 +/- 0.6 mJy, respectively.


Further AMI monitoring is planned. We thank the AMI staff for scheduling these observations.
