N. P. M. Kuin (UCL-MSSL) and M. G. Bernardini (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

In GCN Circ. 24494 (Kuin and Bernardini) we described how we detect
the afterglow of the GRB, but that the photometry was affected by
an object located at a distance of 1.3 arcsec. Further Swift
observations show that the uv-optical afterglow was no longer
detected in white beyond 26ks after the trigger. Data that were taken
after that time are considered template observations that
provide the background contribution to the photometry.

The template net corrected count rates, with instrumental effects
removed, are found to be as follows for a 3" radius circular aperture
at the location of the GRB as reported in GCN 24494:
White = 1.066 +/- 0.031 c/s; u = 0.149 +/- 0.016 c/s;
b = 0.509 +/- 0.061 c/s; uvw2 =  0.011 +/- 0.011 c/s;
v = 0.272 +/- 0.042 c/s; while uvm2 and uvw1 were not observed
until after the afterglow became too faint.

After removal of the template contribution, the following preliminary
detections and 3-sigma upper limits were determined from the count rates
using the zeropoints in the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. 2008,
MNRAS 383, 627; Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for
the image mode exposures:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.09 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
