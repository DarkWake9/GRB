S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano) report:

The position of the event reported in GCN 18711 is consistent with that of 
the known Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR J1935+2154 (GCN 16522).
Due to an error in the  software, this positional coincidence 
was not recognized and properly flagged in the alert packet n.7313

I apologize for the confusion.
