The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 13:46:33 UT on 2 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200502A (trigger 610119998.856084 / 200502574).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 289.5, Dec = 38.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 19h 18m, 38d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.7 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 138.0 degrees.
