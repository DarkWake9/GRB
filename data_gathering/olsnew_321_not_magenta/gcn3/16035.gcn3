A long-duration GRB 140323A (Swift-BAT trigger 592916:
Troja et al., GCN 16027; Sakamoto et al., GCN 16029;
Fermi-GBM detection: Yu & von Kienlin, GCN 16032;
Fermi-LAT detection: Vianello et al., GCN 16034)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=37392.356 s UT (10:23:12.356).

The burst light curve shows multiple peaks in two major bursting episodes.
A total duration of the burst is ~130 s.
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of 3.1(-0.4,+0.7)x10^-5 erg/cm2, and a 64-ms peak flux,
measured from T0+5.376 s, of 3.2(-0.6,+0.7)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum (measured from T0 to T0+106.752 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.09 (-0.15,+0.31),
the high energy photon index beta = -3.0 (-7.0,+0.6),
the peak energy Ep = 127 (-24,+16) keV,
chi2 = 93.4/97 dof.

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 18 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) function with the following model parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.79 (-0.18,+0.20),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.7 (-6.0,+0.3),
the peak energy Ep = 184 (-24,+31) keV,
chi2 = 96.8/87 dof.
