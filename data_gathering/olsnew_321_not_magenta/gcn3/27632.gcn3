The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 13:54:11 UT on 23 Apr 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200423A (trigger 609342856.372534 / 200423579).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 325.0, Dec = 66.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 40m, 66d 47'), with a statistical uncertainty of 11.2 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 55.0 degrees.
