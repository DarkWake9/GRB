H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA) for the Swift team:

We have analysed 7.9 ks of XRT data for the AGILE/Konus/Fermi-detected burst:
GRB 130327B (Longo et al, GCN 14344; Chaplin & Fitzpatrick, GCN 14346; Ohno et
al, GCN 14347; Golenetskii et al, GCN 14348),  from 110.1 ks to 128.6 ks after
the  Fermi/GBM trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode.  An
X-ray source is detected within the Fermi/LAT error circle. The refined XRT
position is RA, Dec = 217.87488, -69.40345 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 14 31 29.97
Dec(J2000): -69 24 12.4

with an uncertainty of 4.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 459 arcsec from the Fermi/LAT position.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

The count rate level is 4 x 10^-3 counts/s.  Further Swift observations have
been scheduled.
