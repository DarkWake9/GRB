The long-duration GRB 170330A (Swift-BAT trigger #744773:
D'Avanzo et al., GCN 20944; Lien et al., GCN 20968;
AstroSat CZTI detection: Sharma et al., GCN 20969)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=80850.946 s UT (22:27:30.946).

The burst light curve shows a single multi-peaked pulse
with a total duration of ~12 s. The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 1.85(-0.54,+0.42)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+4.912 s,
of 4.91(-2.23,+2.17)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.22(-0.67,+0.88),
the high energy photon index beta = -1.98(-0.84,+0.17),
the peak energy Ep = 226(-66,+190) keV
(chi2 = 69/76 dof)

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.
