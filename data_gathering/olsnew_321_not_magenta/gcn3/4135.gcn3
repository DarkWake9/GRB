Using the full data set from the recent telemetry downlink, we report
further analysis of Swift-BAT GRB 051021B (trigger #160672)
(Retter, et al., GCN 4126).  The ground-analysis position is
RA,Dec 126.059,-45.537 {8h 24m 14.2s,-45d 32' 13.0"} (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin (radius, 90%, stat+sys).
T90 is 47 +- 3 sec.  The partial coding fraction is 88 %.
The lightcurve has single FRED peak starting at T-6 sec (FWHM of ~12 sec)
with the decay extending out to greater than T+20 sec.  There is
a second, smaller peak at ~T+20.  Fitting a simple power law over
the full interval from T-5.5 to T+51.5 sec, the photon index is
1.52 +/- 0.14 with a fluence of 9.1 +/- 0.8 X 10^-7 erg/cm^2.
The peak flux in a 1-sec wide window starting at T-2.5 sec
is 0.63 +/- 0.13 ph/cm^2/sec.  All values are in the 15-150 keV band
at the 90% confidence level.
