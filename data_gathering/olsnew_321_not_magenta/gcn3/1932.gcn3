D. M. Smith, R. P. Lin, J. McTiernan, R. Schwartz, C. Wigger, W. Hajdas, 
and A. Zehnder, on behalf of the RHESSI GRB team,

I. Mitrofanov, D. Anfimov, A. Kozyrev, M. Litvak and A. Sanin,
on behalf of the HEND/Odyssey GRB team, and

W. Boynton, C. Fellows, K. Harshman, C. Shinohara and R. Starr,
on behalf of the GRS/Odyssey GRB team, report:

Analysis of the count rates in the front and rear segments of
the RHESSI detectors indicates that it is highly likely that
the correct position for this burst (GCN1930, 1931) is the one at 71 degrees
from the Sun, i.e.:

 ERROR BOX CENTER:  21 h 4 m 14.52 s     -74 o 21 ' 56.53 "
 ERROR BOX CORNER 1:  21 h  3 m 55.15 s    -74 o 23 '  44.85 "  
 ERROR BOX CORNER 2:  21 h  6 m  7.04 s    -74 o 25 '  19.24 "     
 ERROR BOX CORNER 3:  21 h  2 m 22.89 s    -74 o 18 '  28.49 "    
 ERROR BOX CORNER 4:  21 h  4 m 33.81 s    -74 o 20 '   8.06 " 

We will attempt to confirm this with Konus-Wind data, which
are expected shortly.
