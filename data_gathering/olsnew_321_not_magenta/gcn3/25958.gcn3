We observed the field of GRB 191004B (Cenko et al., GCN Circ. 25947) with the
COATLI 50-cm telescope and interim imager at the Observatorio Astron칩mico
Nacional on the Sierra de San Pedro M치rtir (http://coatli.astroscu.unam.mx) from
2019-10-05 06:54 to 12:11, obtaining a total of 1.65 hours of exposure in the w
filter.

At the position of the bright afterglow detected by Swift/UVOT (Cenko et al.,
GCN Circ. 25947), we detect a source with w = 21.47 +/- 0.17.

Our w magnitudes are calibrated against the Pan-STARRS1 catalog, are on an
approximate AB system (Becerra et al., 2019, ApJ, 872, 118), and are not
corrected for Galactic extinction in the direction of the GRB.

We thank the COATLI technical team and the staff of the Observatorio Astron칩mico
Nacional.
