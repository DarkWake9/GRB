TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IBAS detection of bursts from SGR 1806-20

K.Hurley, on behalf of the INTEGRAL SGR TOO collaboration, report


During INTEGRAL TOO observations of the region of SGR 1806-20, performed
from 2003 September 3 22:45 UT to September 4 02:54 UT, two bursts have
been detected and localized by IBAS.

The first burst occurred on September 4 at 00:53:43.9 UT at coordinates
R.A. = 18 08 43.6 Dec.= -20 23 28 (J2000).

The second one occurred at 01:15:56.9 UT at coordinates R.A. = 18 08 34.3
Dec.= -20 26 25.

These localizations have an uncertainty of about 3 arcmin. Therefore the
bursts can be confidently associated with SGR 1806-20 and not with
SGR 1808-20 (GCN 2351).

Both bursts were detected with IBIS/ISGRI in the 15-100 keV range and had
a duration of about 200 ms. Their fluences in the 25-100 keV range were
about 2x10-9 ergs cm-2 and 2x10-8 ergs cm-2.

The TOO INTEGRAL observation of this region (GCN 2372) will continue until
September 7 at 03:05 UT.

Continued ground-based observations of this region are encouraged.
