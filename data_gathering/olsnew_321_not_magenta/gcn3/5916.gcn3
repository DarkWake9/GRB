BAT trigger #250033 occurred at 16:56:30.36 on December 13, 2006.
Swift had lost star tracker lock and the position reported to the BAT
imaging system was in error by a few tenths of a degree, enough to 
allow misidentification of a known source, GRS 1915+105. An immediate
GCN Notice retraction was issued. Some reports have been issued reacting
to this trigger as if it was a real gamma-ray burst.

This trigger was not due to a gamma-ray burst or transient.
