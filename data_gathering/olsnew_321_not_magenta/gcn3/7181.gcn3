M. Nysewander (STScI), D. Reichart, K. Ivarsen, J.A. Crain, A. LaCluyze (UNC) report:


We observed the optical transient of XRF 080109/SN 2008D in NGC
2770 (Berger & Soderberg, GCN 7159; Deng & Zhu, 7160) on
January 12 & 13 with two PROMPT telescopes.  Observations were
taken under good conditions, but at high airmass.


On both nights, the P5 telescope took continuous 60s R-band
exposures for ~3 hrs, while P4 cycled through repeated sequences of
15x60s in BVI for a total of ~1 hr in each filter.   
Assuming the star at RA: 09:09:37.28 Dec: +33:09:35.1 (to be
consistent with D'Elia et al. GCN 7162) to have B=17.25, V=16.71,
R=17.20, and I=16.67 (NOMAD and USNOB), we find the following
preliminary magnitudes for the OT at Jan 12.3 and 13.3:


Filter:   Exposure:  Mag1:   Mag2:


B         12 x 60s   18.6    18.3

V         5 x 60s    17.9    17.7

R         5 x 60s    18.0    18.0

I         5 x 60s    17.2    17.1



These values may suggest a slight brightening over the two nights, but are consistent with no variation. 


Observations are ongoing.
