Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 130528A (trigger #556870)
(D'Elia, et al., GCN Circ. 14711).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 139.405, 87.300 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 17m 37.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = +87d 18' 01.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting
at ~T+0, peaking at ~T+4 sec, and ending at ~T+80 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 59.4 +- 3.6 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.12 to T+79.34 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.39 +- 0.19, 
and Epeak of 118.3 +- 79.7 keV (chi squared 42.3 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.1 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+6.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
3.0 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.67 +- 0.05 (chi squared 48.6 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.
