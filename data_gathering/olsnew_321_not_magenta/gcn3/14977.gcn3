, report on behalf of the CIBO collaboration:

We observed the optical counterpart of the Fermi GRB 130702A (Cheung et
al. GCN 14971; Collazzi et al. GCN 14972) with the Italian 3.6m TNG
telescope located in Canary Islands, equipped with the DOLoRes imager.
Observations were carried out starting on 2013 Jul 3.955 UT (1.95 days
after the Fermi/GBM trigger).
In a single 300 seconds exposures obtained in the SDSS r band we clearly
detect the optical afterglow reported by Singer et al. (GCN 14697) with a
magnitude of r=19.1 (calibrated against nearby SDSS stars). Further
observations are ongoing.
