G. B. Taylor, D. A. Frail (NRAO), and J. S. Bloom (Caltech) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have imaged the entire 2.5 arcmin WFC error circle of GRB 001109
(GCN 879) with the VLA at 8.47 GHz on UT 2000 Nov. 9.80. We detect one
radio source which we designate VLA J1830+5518.  The coordinates of
VLA J1830+5518 are: RA = 18h30m06.51s, DEC = 55d18'35.7" (equinox
J2000) with conservative errors of 0.1 arcsec in each coordinate.  The
flux density on Nov. 9.8 is 236 +/- 31 microJy. The size of VLA
J1830+5518 is less than 0.4 arcsec.  No source is detected in the NRAO
VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) above their
flux limit of 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz.  The density of sources on the sky
stronger than 250 microJy at 8.4 GHz is 0.0145 arcmin**-2.  We
computed an astrometric solution for the DSS-2 image of the field
using the USNO-A2.0 catalogue and found no obvious optical point
source at the position of the radio object."
