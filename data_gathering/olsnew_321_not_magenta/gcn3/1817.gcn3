E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"On 2003, January 15.35 UT we used the VLA at 8.46 GHz to observe the SXC
error circle of GRB 030115 (GCN 1816).  We find one source within the
error circle with a flux of about 0.85 mJy at position:

        RA=11:18:30.55 	DEC=15:03:57.67   (J2000)

However, this source is possibly present in a FIRST survey image
(http://sundog.stsci.edu/top.html) with a flux of about 0.6+/-0.15 mJy at
1.4 GHz.  Further observations are planned."
