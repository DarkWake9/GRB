O. M. Littlejohns (U. Leicester) and S. R. Oates (UCL-MSSL) report on
behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:
 
We have analysed 4.4 ks of XRT data for GRB 100816A (Oates et al. GCN
Circ. 11102), from 89 s to 12.2 ks after the BAT trigger. The data
comprise 144 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given
by Evans et al. (GCN. Circ 11110).
 
The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.29 (+0.05, -0.04), with some flaring activity during
the first snapshot.
 
A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.16 (+0.22, -0.21). The
best-fitting absorption column is 1.4 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 4.5 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.10 (+0.19, -0.16)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.5 (+0.5, -0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2.
The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum is 3.8 x 10^-11 (5.5 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1.
 
If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.29, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.6 x 10^-3 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 5.9 x
10^-14 (8.6 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
