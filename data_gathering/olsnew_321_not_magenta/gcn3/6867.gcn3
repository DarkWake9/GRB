The long GRB 071006 (Cummings, GCN 6858) triggered
Konus-Wind at T0=24133.617 s UT (06:42:13.617).

The burst started at T-T0 ~35 s and had a duration of ~60 s.
As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.08(-1.25, +0.11)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux measured from T0+1.264 s
of 2.66(-1.51, +0.45)x10^-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The spectrum integrated over the main peak (from T0 to T0+8.448 s)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ E^(-alpha)*exp(-E*(2-alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = 0.84(-0.26, +0.22)
and Ep = 334(-61, +95) keV (chi2 = 62.2/60 dof).
The fluence of this part is 8.52(-4.63, +0.47)x10^-6 erg/cm2.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
