The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:43:16 UT on 31 Oct 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 191031C (trigger 594240201.70685 / 191031780).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 120.8, Dec = -59.6 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 08h 03m, -59d 36'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.
