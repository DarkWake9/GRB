S. Covino, G.L. Israel, F. Ghinassi, N. Pinilla, on behalf of the  
CIBO collaboration, report:


We observed the optical counterpart of GRB 060526 (Campana et al. GCN  
5162; French & Jelinek GCN 5165; Rykoff et al. GCN 5166) with the  
3.6m TNG telescope located at the Canary Islands. V and R photometry  
have been obtained with TNG+DOLoRES.

The afterglow is clearly detected at 21:00:56 UT (about 4:32 after  
the burst) with R = 18.43 +- 0.04, assuming R = 15.0 for the USNO  
star at  RA,DEC 15:31:17.90, 00:15:28.8.

Further observations are in progress.
