J. A. Kennea (PSU), K. L. Page (U Leicester), T. G. R. Roegiers (PSU),
T. Sakamoto (AGU) and B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of
the Swift Team:

At 13:44:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) had the low significant 
image trigger (trigger=675784).  The BAT light curve showed nothing.  
We believe this trigger is not due to an astrophysical source.
