collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 150910A (Pagani et al., GCN  18264)  with 
  with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory starting on Sep. 
10 (UT) 18:53:54. We obtained several unfiltered images. The afterglow 
(Pagani et al., GCN 18264; Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 18265) is clearly 
visible in a combined image. The photometry of the combined image is 
following
