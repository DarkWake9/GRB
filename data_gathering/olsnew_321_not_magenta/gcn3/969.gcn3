TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  969
SUBJECT: GRB010222: Optical Observations
DATE:    01/02/22 21:44:41 GMT
FROM:    AAVSO GRB Network at AAVSO  <aavso@aavso.org>

 The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) reports on
behalf of Gary Billings, a member of the AAVSO International GRB Network,
imaging of the optical transient of GRB010222 (GCN 959,960)
at the location given by Henden et al. (GCN 961, 962) and confirmed by
McDowell et  al. (GCN 963).

 Astrometry on the suspected GRB (using Astrometrica + USNO A2.0) gives RA
14 52 12.6 and Dec 43 01 06, with errors of about 0.5" on each axis,
consistent with the measures given in McDowell et al. (GCN 963) and
Henden et al. (GCN 967).
