Kumar (ARIES), K. Misra (ARIES), S.B. Pandey (ARIES) report:

We observed the afterglow of the GRB 210306A (D'Elia et al. GCN
#29597, Watson et al. GCN 29598, Romanov GCN #29599, Strausbaugh et
al. GCN #29600, Ohno et al. GCN #29602, Hentunen et al. GCN #29603,
Stecklum et al. GCN #29604, Veres et al. GCN #29605, Lipunov et al.
GCN #29606, Zhu et al. GCN #29607)  with 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical
Telescope (DFOT) at Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research
Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES), India. We took
observations in B,V,R,I bands. We detect the optical afterglow with a
magnitude of 20.24 +- 0.13 in R-band at 9.8 hrs after the burst.
Further observations are ongoing with 1.3m DFOT.

The magnitude is not corrected for the Galactic extinction in the
direction of the burst. The photometric calibration is performed using
the standard stars from the USNO-B1.0 catalog.
