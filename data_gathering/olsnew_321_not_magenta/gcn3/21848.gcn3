We report the preliminary detection of a radio source in a beam centered
on RA 13.096h, Dec -22.024deg, the LIGO/Virgo G298048 event coordinates,
during a four-hour observation on August 17 (19:15 UTC, 6.6 hours after
the GW trigger), using station 1 of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1)
[GCN 21680]. Simultaneous ON-OFF observations were taken at 25 MHz and
45 MHz, and follow-up observations were taken August 24 (19:50 UTC), one
week after the initial observations. Comparison of the ON-OFF
observations for the two epochs indicate the apparent presence of a ~20
Jy source, at 25 MHz, in the beam on RA 13.096h, Dec -22.024deg. There
is no difference between the ON-OFF results at 45 MHz, for the two
epochs. Further analysis and follow up observations are underway.
