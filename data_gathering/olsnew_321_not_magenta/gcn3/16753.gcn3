Jamie A. Kennea (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift Mission Operations 
Center:

The Swift Mission Operations Center (MOC), located near the Penn State 
University Park campus, is back to full operational status. As of 14:40UT 
August 28th, 2014, Swift's automated burst slew response was re-enabled 
(see GCN #16749), and as of 18:30UT, August 29th, 2014, we have lifted the 
moratorium on TOOs. We thank Swift's user community for their patience 
during the move.
