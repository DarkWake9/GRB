Using the data set from T-60.7 to T+104.6 sec from the recent telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060108 (trigger #176453)
(Oates, et al., GCN 4443).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA,Dec = 147.016, 31.933 {9h 48m 3.9s, 31d 55' 59.8"} (deg; J2000)
+- 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding
was 100%.
 
The mask-tagged lightcurve shows a rise starting at T-5 sec, peaking
at T+1 sec, and then a somewhat slower fall with a small secondary
peak at T+10 sec (~4 sec wide).  T90 (15-350 keV) is (14.4 +- 1) sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.01 +- 0.17.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is (3.7 +- 0.4) x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.60 sec in the 15-150 keV
band is (0.7 +- 0.1) ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90%
confidence level.
