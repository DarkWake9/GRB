The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 10:25:44 UT on 1 May 2020, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 200501A (trigger 610021549.84722 / 200501435).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 45.9, Dec = -19.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 03h 03m, -19d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.3 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 78.0 degrees.
