The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 21:30:03 UT on 27 Aug 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220827A (trigger 683328608.07386 / 220827896).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 113.1, Dec = -1.1 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 32m, -1d 06'), with a statistical uncertainty of 15.1 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 99.0 degrees.
