TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  16705
SUBJECT: GRB 140818A: Correction to GCN 16702

H. Negoro, F. Honda  (Nihon U.) report on behalf of the MAXI team:

The trigger time of MAXI-GSC detection of GRB 140818A reported in
GCN 16702 is incorrect. The correct trigger time is "2014-08-18T05:31:28 UT",
and about 79 sec after the Fermi-GBM detection (Triger Number 430032612).
The time and the location of Fermi-GBM and MAXI-GSC GRBs suggest that
that the bursts are the same origin.
We apologize for the mistake.
