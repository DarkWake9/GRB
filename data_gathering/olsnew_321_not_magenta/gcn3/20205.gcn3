K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:34:37 the Swift Burst Alert Telescope detected Cyg X-1 at
its typical flux levels.  BAT misidentified this detection as a
new source and reported it as a trigger (trigger=723539). 

This is not an astrophysically interesting event.
