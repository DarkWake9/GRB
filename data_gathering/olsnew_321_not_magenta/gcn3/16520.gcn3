M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI),
K. L. Page (U Leicester) and T. Sakamoto (AGU) report on behalf of the
Swift Team:

At 09:32:48 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 140705A (trigger=603488).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 293.725, +21.899 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 34m 54s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 53' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a short spike 
with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~4500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 09:33:49.6 UT, 61.0 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 293.7318, 21.8979 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 19h 34m 55.64s
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 53' 52.4"
with an uncertainty of 2.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 23 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No
spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to
determine the column density. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 64 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of
the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the large, but uncertain extinction expected. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. Stamatikos (Michael.Stamatikos-1 AT nasa.gov). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
