Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 140129A (trigger #585128)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 15760).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 37.851, -1.594 deg which is
  RA(J2000)  =  02h 31m 24.2s
  Dec(J2000) = -01d 35' 40.1"
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak structure starts at ~T+1.2 s,
peaks at ~T+2.5 s, and ends at ~ T+4.6 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 2.99 +- 0.79 sec
(estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+1.25 to T+4.62 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.08 +- 0.33.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.91 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
