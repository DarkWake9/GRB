H. Mendelson (Wise observatory, TAU) report:

We continue our time-resolved photometry of GRB 030329. Following a brief
standstill (Lipkin et al, GCN 2054), the OT decayed in brightness from
March 31 20:00 to March 31 23:15, reaching a minimum of approximately
R=16.9. At that time the trend reversed direction again and from 23:15 to
01:30 UT we detected a rebrightening of the OT by approximately 0.1
magnitude.
