S. B. Cenko (NASA/GSFC) and D. A. Perley (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the location of GRB150213B (Pagani et al., GCN 17464) with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations began at 10:15 UT on 2015 Feb 14 (dt ~ 11.7 hr after the Swift trigger) and were obtained in the SDSS g, r, i, and z filters.  We marginally detect the optical afterglow (Kann et al., GCN 17465; Malesani et al., GCN 17467; Pozanenko et al., GCN 17468; Butler et al., GCN 17470).  Using nearby point sources from SDSS for reference, we measure an r-band magnitude of r' = 22.65 +/- 0.33 - however we caution that the photometry is likely affected by the presence of the nearby bright star (e.g., Kann et al., GCN 17465).
