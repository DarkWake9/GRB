Arne Rau and Gottfried Kanbach (both MPE Garching) report on behalf of 
the OPTIMA-Burst Team:

"We observed the location of GRB 120816A (Page et al. GCN #13654) with 
OPTIMA-Burst (Kanbach et al. 2008, Astrophys. and Sp. Sci. Lib. Vol. 
351, 153) currently mounted at the 1.3m telescope at Skinakas 
Observatory, University of Crete. Observations started at 19:22:44 UT 
(249 sec after the burst) with unfiltered 20s exposures using the 
field-viewing CCD camera. Within the updated XRT error circle we find a 
fading source located at:

RA(J2000) = 18:48:34.4
Dec(J2000) = -06:56:16

with an approximate uncertainty of 1" in both coordinates.

We measure the following magnitudes:

T0+         white
--------------
249s        ~17.8
4844s    >19.1

calibrated against the R=15.2mag reference star USNO-B1.0 0830-0537586."
