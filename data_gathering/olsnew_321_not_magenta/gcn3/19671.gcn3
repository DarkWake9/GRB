The long-duration GRB 160628A (Fermi-GBM trigger #488814821;
Konus-Wind trigger time on 13:53:41.910) triggered the CALET Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (CGBM) at 13:53:37.9 on 28 June 2016.  The burst signal
was only seen by the SGM instrument.

The light curve of the SGM shows a double peak structure starting at T+0.1 sec
and ending at T+6 sec.  The peak times of the spikes are T+1 sec and T+3.5 sec.
The T90 duration measured by the SGM data is 5.1 +- 0.9 sec (40-230 keV).

The light curve is available at

The CALET data used in this analysis are provided by the Waseda CALET Operation Center
located at the Waseda University.
