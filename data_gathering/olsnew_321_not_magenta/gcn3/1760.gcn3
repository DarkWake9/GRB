M. Nysewander, J. Moran, L. Johnson, D. Moschler, D. Reichart (University
of North Carolina), and A. Henden (USRA/USNO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We observed 100% of the ~9 square arcminute error box of the short-duration
burst GRB 021201 (GCN 1719) with the 0.6-meter Morehead Observatory
telescope beginning 2.1 days after the burst (GCN 1721) and with the
1.0-meter USNO telescope beginning 2.9 days after the burst.  Both
observations were made without filter and the second observation goes
significantly deeper than the first.

Visual comparison of the first and second epoch images reveals no transient
sources to the limiting magnitude of the first epoch image, which we
measure to be Rc = 21.2 mag (3 sigma), 21.6 mag (2 sigma), and 22.4 mag (1
sigma) using the field calibration of Henden (GCN 1723).

Three Chandra sources lie in the field of view of the first epoch image and
20 Chandra sources lie in the field of view of the second epoch image.
Visual comparison of the first and second epoch images and the DSS-2 (Red)
reveals no obvious transient sources.
