R. Strausbaugh (U. of the Virgin Islands), A. Cucchiara (U. of the Virgin Islands/College of Marin) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We observed Fermi GRB 190829A (Fermi GBM Team at MSFC/Fermi-GBM, GCN 25551) with
the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument on August 30, from 00:21 to 00:44 UT
(corresponding to 4.43 to 4.81 hours from the GRB trigger time)
with the SDSS i' filter.

We performed a series of 10x120s exposures, and we clearly
detect the optical afterglow (Xu et al. GCN 25555) with
the following  magnitude:

i' = 15.92 +/- 0.09

This flux measurement may be partially contaminated by the host galaxy, and it is calibrated against several USNO-B1.0 objects near the GRB location but is not corrected for Galactic Extinction.

Observations and analysis are ongoing with data from a second epoch collected on August 31, and a planned follow-up on September 3.

These observations were possible thanks to the USVI NASA-EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Development (RID) grant NNX16AL44A.
