At 23:24:18.3 UT (84253.3s UT) on 27 June, the HETE FREGATE and WXM 
instruments detected and localized an intense burst from SGR1900+14, 
a soft gamma-ray repeater. This event is the second burst localized 
from this source in the past week, indicating that it may have 
resumed an active state. (The first burst was reported in GCN 
Circular #1071.) The coordinates (J2000) of the 27 June burst are:

R.A. = 286.947 (19h07m47s.2)

Dec. = +9.362 (+9:21:41)

The error circle for this localization is 12 arcmin in radius. 
SGR1900+14 lies 4.6 arcmin from the HETE position.

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was <200 ms. A total of 1084 
counts above background were detected during that interval, 
corresponding to a fluence of ~2 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 . The peak flux 
was >3 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie >100 x Crab flux).

Follow-up observations of this transient are encouraged.

Additional information on this burst detection (including light 
curves), as well as for the HETE mission, will be available at:
