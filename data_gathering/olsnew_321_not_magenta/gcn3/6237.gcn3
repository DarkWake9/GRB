Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the full telemetry
downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 070330 (trigger
#273180) (Grupe et al., GCN Circ. 6232).  The BAT ground-calculated
position is RA, Dec = 269.533, -63.799 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 58m  7.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -63d 47' 54.7" 
with an uncertainty of 1.9 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90%
containment).  The partial coding was 80%.

The mask weighted light curve consists of a single FRED-like peak.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 9.0 +- 1 sec (estimated error including
systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.1 to T+8.9 is best fit by a power
law with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 
-0.33 +- 1.76, and Epeak of 36.3 +- 6.1 keV (chi squared 56.05 for 56
d.o.f.).  For this model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is
1.8 +- 0.3 x 10^-07 erg/cm2 and the 1-sec peak flux measured from
T-0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.9 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to
a simple power law gives a photon index of 2.06 +- 0.22 (chi squared
66.7 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
