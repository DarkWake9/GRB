M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) and V. N. Yershov (UCL-MSSL) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:36:28 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 130206A (trigger=547918). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 140.375, -58.160 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 09h 21m 30s
   Dec(J2000) = -58d 09' 36"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked 
structure with a total duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~4 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+48.5
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is M. De Pasquale (mdp AT mssl.ucl.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
