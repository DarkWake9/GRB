TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  4272
SUBJECT: GRB 051114: Swift-BAT detection of a short burst

At 04:11:30 UT, Swift-BAT triggered and located GRB 051114 (trigger=163844).
The on-board software did not locate this burst with sufficient significance,
however ground processing was able to extract a location.  The BAT ground
calculated location is RA,Dec 226.274d,+60.150d {15h 05m 06s,+60d 09' 00"}
(J2000), with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, stat+sys).
The BAT light curve shows two short peaks separated by ~1 sec with a total
duration of 2 sec.  The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~0.5 seconds after the trigger.

We note that due a handling mistake on the ground, the GCN BAT_POSITION Notice
was generated with incorrect values in the following fields:  TRIGGER_NUM,
GRB_INTEN, BKG_INTEN, BKG_TIME, BKG_DUR, GRB_TIME, MERIT_PARAMS.  All the 
other numbers in the Notice are correct (including the Sun & Moon locations 
and the Galactic and Ecliptic coordinates).
