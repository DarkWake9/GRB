We report observations of the BAYESTAR skymap of the BNS event S190510g
(The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration, GCN
24442) with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope (Chambers et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05560C) and the ATLAS telescopes (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP
PASP, 13, 164505). 

We acknowledge that is now a marginal candidate (LSC & VC, GCN 24489)
and note that we completed our scanning of the BAYESTAR skymap, before
the LALInference map was available (resulting in a final 4%
probability coverage).

For Pan-STARRS1 : images were taken in the PS1 w and i-bands (Tonry
et al. 2012, ApJ 750, 99) in the standard NEO search sequence. At each
pointing position a sequence of quads (4 x 45 sec) was taken. This
observing sequence ensures exactly the same pointing position for each
of the quads.

The PS1 images were processed with the IPP (Magnier et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05240) and difference images were produced using the
Pan-STARRS1 Science Consortium 3Pi images as reference
frames. Transient candidates were run through our standard filtering
procedures, combined with a machine learning algorithm (Wright et
al. 2015, MNRAS, 449, 451) and all candidates were
spatially cross-matched with known minor planets, and major star,
galaxy, AGN and multi-wavelength catalogues (as described in Smartt et
al. 2016, MNRAS, 462 4094).

For ATLAS, we observed with sequences of 4 x 30s, typically reaching
o ~ 19.5 in each pointing (e.g. Weiland et al. GCN 24107).

We covered the small probability region of the LalInference map (total
summed probability of 4%) at 13-14hrs (the 6hr region was not visible
from Hawaii).  We began taking Pan-STARRS data at 2019-05-10 07:09
(UTC), ~4.2 hrs after the GW trigger. ATLAS started at a similar time.

No new extragalactic transient candidates were discovered with ATLAS
within the 90% contour (brighter than about o ~ 19.5) 

In the PS1 data, the following 23 transients were found lying within
the 90% contour of the LALInference map. We give them 3 ranks : 

Rank 1 candidates are plausibly within the distance range reported by
the LIGO-Virgo analysis (~130 Mpc < d < ~220 Mpc). This comes from
host galaxy association and their spectroscopic or photometric
redshifts. 

Rank 2 candidates are not obviously associated with a catalogued
host galaxy. 

Rank 3 candidates are probably associated with a galaxy outside the
distance range.
