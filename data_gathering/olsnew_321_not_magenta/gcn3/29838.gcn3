Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 210419A (trigger #1044032)
(Laha et al., GCN Circ. 29828).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 86.912, -65.452 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 47m 38.9s
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 27' 07.2"
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 61%.

The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about ~100 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.43 +- 11.69 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T+21.92 to T+95.01 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.17 +- 0.24.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.8 +- 1.2 x 10^-07 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+41.82 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
