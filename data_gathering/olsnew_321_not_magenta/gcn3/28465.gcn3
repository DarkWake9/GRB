Simeon Reusch, Robert Stein, Anna Franckowiak (DESY), Steve Schulze (WIS) and Jesper Sollerman (Stockholm University) report:

We observed ZTF candidate ZTF20acaapwk/SN2020tno (Reusch et al., GCN 28441; see also Belkin et al., GCN 28453), a possible counterpart to high-energy neutrino IceCube-200916A (Blaufuss, GCN 28433), using the NOT+ALFOSC spectrograph on 21 September 2020.

We classify SN2020tno as a type Ia supernova, thereby excluding any connection to IC200916A.

ZTF20acaapwo/AT2020tnp remains a candidate.
