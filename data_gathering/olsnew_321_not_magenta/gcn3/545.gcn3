on behalf of a larger European collaboration report:

R-band images obtained at the 1.54-m Danish Telescope on Feb 11.03-11.08 contain
a faint object located at alfa(2000)=01 59 15.6 delta(2000)=-40 39 33.8
+/- 2". The position of the object is consistent with the X-ray position
determined by Chandra (GCN 544).  The magnitude of the object is about
R~23.1+/-0.5. Optical/IR observations are urgently required.

[GCN OPS NOTE (11Feb00): The time-of-observation was incorrect in the
distributed version of Circular 545.  The time was listed as Feb 2.03-2.08,
but the correct time is Feb 11.03-11.08.  The statement of "on behalf
of a larger European collaboration" was also added.  This archived copy
has been corrected.]
