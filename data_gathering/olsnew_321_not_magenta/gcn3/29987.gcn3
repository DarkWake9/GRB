The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 10:58:57 UT on 11 May 2021, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 210511A (trigger 642423542.350354 / 210511458).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 249.3, Dec = 69.0 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 16h 37m, 69d 00'), with a statistical uncertainty of 10.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 34.0 degrees.
