The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB

At 18:20:02 UT on 19 Sep 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190919A (trigger 590610007.65552 / 190919764).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 357.4, Dec = -21.8 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 23h 49m, -21d 48'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.5 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83.0 degrees.
