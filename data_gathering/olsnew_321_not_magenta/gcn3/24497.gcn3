and

S. Barthelmy, J. Cummings, H. Krimm, and D. Palmer,
on behalf of the Swift-BAT team, report:

The short-duration GRB 190510A was detected by Fermi (GBM trigger
579176361), Konus-Wind, and Swift (BAT) at about 37156 s UT (10:19:16).
The burst was outside the coded field of view of the BAT.

We have triangulated this GRB to a Konus-GBM annulus centered at
RA(2000)=34.022 deg (02h 16m 05s)  Dec(2000)=+13.078 deg (+13d 04' 42"),
whose radius is 89.425 +/- 0.966 deg (3 sigma).

The annulus is inconsistent with the GW compact binary merger candidate
event S190510g (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo
Collaboration GCN Circ. 24442).

This annulus may be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
