At 11:30:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located a possible GRB (trigger=639636).  Swift slewed immediately
to the location.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 350.788, +7.897, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 23m 09s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 53' 50"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers (7.4 sigma),
there is nothing significant in the real-time light curve. 

The XRT began observing the field at 11:33:13.7 UT, 151.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. No source was detected in the 2.5-s promptly available
image. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the
XRT counterpart. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 104 seconds with the White filter
starting 502 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 16% of
the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. 
The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the
BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No
correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of
0.11. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. Maselli (maselli AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
