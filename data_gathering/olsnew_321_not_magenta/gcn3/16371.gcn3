(IKI) report on behalf of larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed a field of the Swift GRB 140606A (Stroh et al., GCN 16353) 
with AS-32 (0.7m) telescope of Abastumani Observatory starting on June,
06 (UT) 18:16:50. We obtained several unfiltered frames with exposure of 
each frame of 120 s. Within the BAT ground-calculated position (Cummings 
et al., GCN 16354) we do not detect evident variable source.

The details of the photometry are the following:
