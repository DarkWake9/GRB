report on behalf of the AGILE Team:

The AGILE MiniCALorimeter (MCAL; 0.4-100 MeV) detected the short GRB
220323A at T0 = 2022-03-23 12:10:11 (UTC), reported by Fermi GBM (GCN
#31782).

The event lasted 0.35 s and released 295 counts in the detector, above a
background rate of 630 Hz. The time-integrated spectrum of the burst can be
fitted in the energy range 0.4-2 MeV with a power-law with ph.ind = 2.44
(-0.70/+1.13), resulting in a reduced chi-squared of 1.06 (21 d.o.f.) and a
fluence of 5.6e-07 erg/cm^2 (90% confidence level), in the same energy
range. The MCAL light curve can be found at
http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/077531_GRB_575122215.552228.png . At
the T0, the event was 134 deg off-axis.

The burst is also clearly visible in the AGILE scientific ratemeters of the
MCAL detector, where it released a total number of 1550 counts (above a
background rate of 1230 Hz). The AGILE MCAL ratemeters light curve can be
found at http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/GRB220323A_AGILE_RM.png .

Additional analysis of AGILE data is in progress. Automatic MCAL GRB alert
Notices can be found at: https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/agile_mcal.html. Please
note that in the MCAL notice #575122215 the T0 was affected by a temporal
shift of about +4.0 sec due to episodic automated ground software problems
which are then corrected offline.
