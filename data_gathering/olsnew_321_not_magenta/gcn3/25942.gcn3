P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the Fermi/GBM
detected burst GRB 191001A (GCN Circ. 25893, 25894), collecting 5.2 ks
of Photon Counting (PC) mode data between T0+114.2 ks and T0+161.3 ks.

No X-ray sources have been detected consistent with being within 2.0
arcsec	of the likely associated optical transient AT2019rog (GCN Circ.
25911, 25918, 25919 and Tonry et al., TNSTR 1954). The 3-sigma upper
limit in the field ranges from ~0.002 to ~0.003 ct s^-1, corresponding
to a 0.3-10 keV observed flux of 8.6e-14 to 1.0e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(assuming a typical GRB spectrum).

The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis of the XRT observations,
including a position-specific upper limit calculator, are available at
https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00020949.
