K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB Team, E. Mazets and S. Golenetskii,
on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB Team, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-
Wind and NEAR GRB teams, report:

Ulysses, Konus-Wind, and NEAR observed this burst at 72065 s.  As observed
by Ulysses, it had a duration ~30 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of 3.3E-05
erg/cm^2, and a peak flux of 7.4E-06 erg/cm^2 s over 0.25 s.  We have
triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma, 74 sq. arcmin. error box
whose coordinates are:

    RA(2000)                 DEC(2000)
 18 h  6 m 32.40 s    -24 o 45 '  45.77 "  (CENTER)
 18 h  5 m  3.22 s    -24 o 29 '  45.04 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  6 m 30.27 s    -24 o 43 '  33.42 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  6 m 34.54 s    -24 o 47 '  58.24 "  (CORNER)
 18 h  8 m  4.61 s    -25 o  2 '  11.39 "  (CORNER)

This error box may be improved.
