D. Malesani (SISSA), S. Piranomonte (INAF-OAR), S. Covino (INAF/OABr), 
N. Masetti, E. Maiorano (INAF/IASF Bo), A. Magazzu', G. Mainella 
(INAF/TNG), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 
5117) with the 3.6 TNG telescope located in the Canary Islands. Two 
R-band observations were acquired under good observing conditions, with 
mean times May 13.018 and May 13.065 UT (1.2 and 2.3 hr after the GRB, 
respectively). The optical afterglow (Cummings et al., GCN 5117; Mundell 
& Steele, GCN 5118) is well detected and faded by 0.58 +- 0.04 mag 
between the two epocs. The inferred decay index is alpha = 0.81 +- 0.06, 
assuming a flux decay F(t) = K*t^-alpha.

We acknowledge significant support from the observing staff at TNG.
