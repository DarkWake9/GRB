Autumn Homewood, Kiran Garimella, Stephen Fuller and Dieter H. Hartmann,
report on behalf of the Clemson GRB Follow-Up Team, and the FUN
Collaboration:

We imaged the central 8x12 arcmin field of the HETE error box for trigger
3951 (GCN 4172) with the SARA 0.9-m at Kitt Peak. We do not detect the OT
reported by Jelinek, et al (GCN 4175). We began observations under cloudy
conditions at UT 2005 Oct 29 02:27:55, approximately 11 hours after the
burst, and stacked 18 R-band exposures of 180 seconds each. We derive a
limiting magnitude of R=20.4 +/-0.3 mag. Images were calibrated using the
USNO B1.0 Catalog. This message may be cited.
