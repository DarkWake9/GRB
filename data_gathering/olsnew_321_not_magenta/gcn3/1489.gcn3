T. Miyata, S. Nishiura, H. Mito on behalf of KISO GRB team, 
Y. Urata (Titech / RIKEN), H. Yamaoka (Univ. Kyushu) report: 


We have imaged the entire error box of GRB020812 (G. Ricker et al.=
GCN1468 ) with the Bisei Astronomical Observatory (BAO) 1.01 m
telescope (FOV 7.8'x5.2') with 12 nonfilter pointing observations
starting at Aug 12 14:00 UT and at Aug 13 14:30 UT.  

The optical transient candidate reported by A. Pozanenko et
al. (GCN1481) was not detected at either epoch with a limit comparable
to that of the DSS2 red image, or approximately R=19 estimated by
comparison with USNO-A2.0 (U0825_18548790).  

We also covered the entire error box with the KISO observatory 1.05 m
Schmidt telescope (FOV 50'x50') starting at Aug 12 15:08 UT.  The OT
candidate was not detected.  

Following is the summary of the observations.  

   Site   Time (UT)  Exptime  Filter Limit mag.
   BAO     14:20      60 s    no     19  
   BAO     14:48      60 s    no     19  
   KISO    15:08     900 s     R     17

Further analysis is in progress.
