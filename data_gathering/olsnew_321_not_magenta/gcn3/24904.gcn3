Daniele B. Malesani (DTU Space), Jyri J. Lehtinen (MPS), Teemu Willamo 
(Univ. Helsinki), Zipei Zhu (NAO/CAS), Dong Xu (NAO/CAS), report on 
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the bright optical counterpart (Siegel & Sonbas, GCN 24889) 
of GRB 190627A (Sonbas et al., GCN 24888) using the Nordic Optical 
Telescope (NOT) equipped with the StanCam imager, using the Bessel R and 
I filters. Observations were conducted starting on Jun 28.886 UT (1.415 
days after the trigger).

The optical counterpart is clearly detected in our images in both 
filters. We measure a preliminary magnitude r = 20.2 +- 0.1 AB 
(calibrated against the Pan-STARRS catalog).
