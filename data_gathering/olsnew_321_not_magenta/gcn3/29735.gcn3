collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al, 2020,
arxiv:2011.07067) showed detection of a long GRB 210324A, which was also
detected by Fermi-GBM (GCN #29707).

The source was clearly detected in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light
curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at
2021-03-24 11:14:32 UT in two quadrants (out of four). The measured peak
count rate associated with the burst is 165 (+44, -21) cts/s above the
background in the combined data of four quadrants, with a total of 2373
(+286, -392) cts. The local mean background count rate was 490 (+3, -3)
cts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 33 (+2, -5) s.

CZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at
http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb. CZTI is built by a TIFR-led
consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and
PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed and facilitated
the project.
