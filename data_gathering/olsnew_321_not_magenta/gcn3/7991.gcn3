S. T. Holland, P. A. Ward (MSSL-UCL), and F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT Team:

Preliminary UVOT photometry of the afterglow of GRB 080721 (Marshall,
et al. 2008, GCN Circ. 7988) shows that the afterglow is strongly
detected in the U band, but not in the UVW1, UVM2, or UVW2 bands at
approximately 825 s after the BAT trigger.  This suggests that the
redshift of GRB 080721 may be greater than approximately 2.3.
