report on behalf of the Insight-HXMT team:

Insight-HXMT was taking data normally around the trigger time
(T0=2019-08-06T13:20:48.00 UTC) of HAWC-190806A event 
(GCN #25284), which was monitored without any occultation by 
the Earth. 

Within T0 +/- 100 s, no significant excess events (SNR > 3 sigma) are 
found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves.

Assuming the counterpart GRB with three typical GRB Band spectral 
models, two typical duration timescales (1 s, 10 s) from the center 
of the position of the alert is (RA=78.125 deg, DEC=6.589 deg), 
the 5-sigma upper-limits fluence (0.2 - 5 MeV, incident energy) are 
reported below:

Band model 1 (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Ep=70 keV):
1 s:   1.8e-08 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.8e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 2 (alpha=-1.0, beta=-2.3, Ep=230 keV):
1 s:   3.6e-08 erg cm^-2
10 s:  3.3e-07 erg cm^-2

Band model 3 (alpha=-0.0, beta=-1.5, Ep=1000 keV):
1 s:   1.8e-07 erg cm^-2
10 s:  1.2e-06 erg cm^-2

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (deposited energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate
the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside
of the spacecraft.
