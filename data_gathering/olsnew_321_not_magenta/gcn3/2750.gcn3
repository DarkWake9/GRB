H. Terada, M. Akiyama (Subaru Telescope, NAOJ) and N. Kawai (Tokyo
Tech) report:

"We have made the second epoch observation of the afterglow candidate
(GCN 2734) of GRB 040924 (=H3564, GCN 2735) in the K'-band with IRCS
on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope at 15:07-15:41 UT on September 25 (27.5
hours after the burst) for an integration time of 1200 seconds with an
average seeing of 0.52 arcsec.

At the position of the afterglow, we detected an extended source with
magnitude K'=20.4 +/- 0.2.  It is probably the afterglow of GRB 040924
with a significant contribution from its host galaxy.  Comparison with
the earlier flux (K'=17.5 at t=2.4 hr, Terada and Akiyama, GCN 2742)
imply that the NIR afterglow decay index was steeper than -1.
