The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely SHORT GRB

At 06:46:22.00 UT on 21 Mar 2022, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 220321A (trigger 669537987 / 220321282).

The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 170.8, Dec = 28.9 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 11h 23m, +28d 54'), with a statistical uncertainty of 8.6 degrees.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 57.0 degrees.
