D.W. Fox reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO GRB Collaboration:  

"We have observed the error box of GRB021004 (HETE Trigger 2380;
trigger time 12:06:13.57 UT) with the 48-inch Oschin/NEAT robotic
telescope at Palomar Observatory, with three 60-second integrations
beginning at 12:15:11, 12:17:45, and 12:22:52 UT.  We identify a new,
stationary, fading, point-like object by comparison with the Digitized
Sky Survey.  The object coordinates are:

    RA 00:26:54.689, Dec +18:55:41.3   (J2000)

with an uncertainty of less than 0.5" in each coordinate.  Deriving an
R-band photometric zero-point for our unfiltered observations by
reference to the USNO star at 00:26:58.713 +18:56:56.61, which we
assume to have magnitude R=15.3, we find object magnitudes at our
three mean epochs of:

         Mean Epoch  
       UT      From GRB   Magnitude
  ========================================
    12:15:41 UT   567 s   15.34 mag

    12:23:22     1028     15.78
  ========================================

Given the source brightness and fading behavior we identify the object
as the likely optical afterglow of GRB021004.  A finding chart from
these observations may be found at

At 12:06:13.57 UTC (43573.57 s UT) on 4 Oct 2002, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2380, a long GRB.  The WXM
flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Position
Notice at 12:07:02 UT, 49 sec after the beginning of the burst.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 13:19:54 UT,
73 minutes after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 14.  The WXM
location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 10
arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 47s, Dec = +18d 59' 13" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a further
refinement in the location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice
at 14:39:51 UT, 154 minutes after the burst.  The SXC localization SNR
was 9.  The SXC location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle
that is 2 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 57s, Dec = +18d 55' 44" (J2000).

The SXC localization may be improved.

In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~100 seconds.
In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst also had a duration of ~100
seconds.

This revised SXC localization is shifted 38 arcsec with respect to, 
but lies fully within, the original 120 arcsec radius SXC error

The magnitudes are based on a preliminary photometric calibration.
The USNO star at RA=00:26:58.713, DEC=+18:56:56.61 (GCN #1564) is
found to have a magnitude of R=15.64.

These five observations indicate that a break in the light curve has
occurred. The current decay slope is alpha=1.32. A light curve is
available at:
http://astro.phys.au.dk/~michaelw/GRB021004/lightcurve.ps
Here we have included the observations from GCN #1564, 1566, 1567 and
1570 assuming R=15.64 for the USNO star.

We also have obtained polarimetric observations and a spectrum
covering 3800AA-6800AA. From the lack of Ly-alpha absorption we
conclude that z<2.1."

report:

Images of the afterglow associated with GRB 021004 (GCN 1564)
were obtained with the CTIO 4m + Mosaic Camera and
the Fred Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope beginning
at Oct. 5.15 (UT). Preliminary analysis of the
R-band images provide the following magnitudes
assuming the USNO star noted in GCN 1573 has a
magnitude of R=15.64:

Oct. 5 UT   R
  03:00    19.10

  07:23    19.25
  08:43    19.23
  09:53    19.31

These data indicate that the rapid decay (GCN 1573)
has slowed considerably. The power-law index of
the optical light between 15 and 22 hours after the
burst is only 0.37. This behavior is similar
to the bump seen in GRB 000103c which may have been
due to a microlensing event (Garnavich, Loeb & Stanek
2000, ApJ, 554, 11). Monitoring this object at a
moderate time resolution is urged.

Hobby-Eberly Telescope GRB followup team:

"We have obtained spectra of the optical counterpart of GRB021004 (GCN
1564) with the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly telescope.  The observations
consisted of a series of three 15-minute exposures starting at
2002-Oct-5 3:34UT and a series of three 15-minute exposures starting
at 2002-Oct-5 8:24UT with the Marcario Low-Resolution Spectrograph.
The spectra cover the range 4200 - 9200 Angstrom at a spectral
resolution of approximately 15 Angstrom.  We detect the Mg II
absorption lines reported by Fox et al.  (GCN 1569) and confirm the
presence of two absorption systems at z=1.38 and z=1.60.  We do not
detect any significant absorption corresponding to the Mg I line at a
rest wavelength of 2853 Angstrom (with z=1.60) as reported by Fox et
al.  (GCN 1569).  We do not find any lines suggestive of absorption
systems at higher redshifts.  We also detect the Fe II UV1, UV2, and
UV3 absorption multiplets associated with both redshift systems (the
Fe II lines associated with the z=1.60 have already been reported by
Fox et al.).  In addition we also find four prominent absorption lines
at observed wavelengths of 4633, 4664, 5109, and 5152 Angstrom, which
we have not yet been able to identify.  The ratio of wavelengths
between these pair of lines approximately equals (1+1.38)/(1+1.60),
which suggests that these lines are from the same features with rest
wavelengths of 1947 and 1960 Angstroms.  The continuum shape can be
described by a power law of the form f_nu ~ nu^{-p}.  After correcting
for Galactic extinction we tentatively estimate a power-law index of 
p ~ 1.5."

DATE:    02/10/05 18:20:08 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the afterglow coordinates
for GRB021004 (Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565; Fox et al. GCN 1564)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=14.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb021004.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

The coordinates of the afterglow, based on UCAC2, are:
  00:26:54.68  +18:55:41.6  J2000
The error in RA is about 0.05arcsec; the error in Dec
is about 0.2arcsec.  These coordinates will be improved,
but are in good agreement with Fox et al.
The object is nor particularly red or blue,
so a typical field star should work for a comparison.

While the night was photometric, the GRB field was observed
at high airmass due to other programs on the 1.0m telescope.
We estimate the present zeropoint errors to be about 0.03mag.
We will be extending this calibration with additional nights to
ensure against a systematic zeropoint error, and to include
U-band measures.  You should check the dates on
the .dat file prior to final publication to get the latest photometry.

In particular, the comparison star used by Fox et al.
has the following position and magnitudes:

    RA (J2000) DEC           V     B-V    V-R   R-I
00:26:58.77  +18:56:56.1  16.261  1.204  0.737  0.664

These values yield Rc=15.52, somewhat fainter than the
assumed magnitude in Fox.

Calibration of the GRB021004 field will continue around October 9 UT.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004 (GCN #1564) with the 
Red Buttes Observatory 0.6 meter telescope, operated through the 
University of Wyoming, between 4:37 UT and 6:25 UT on October 5 2002.

Typical errors on these values are +/- 0.1 mag.  Calibration was completed 
assuming the USNO star from Weidinger (GCN #1573) has an R magnitude of 
15.64.  Further analysis and observations are scheduled in the coming

GRB 021004: Optical Photometry at 1.5 Days

S. Holland (Notre Dame), J. P. U. Fynbo, M. Weidinger (Aarhus)
M. P. Egholm (NOT), and A. Levan (Leicester)
on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

     We have obtained deep R-band images of the field containing
GRB 021004 using the 2.56-meter Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma
on Oct. 6.0 UT.  The optical afterglow of GRB 011211 is visible in our
images.  Using the comparison star from Fox et al. (2002, GCN 1564)
and the calibration of Henden (2002, GNC 1583) we find the following
preliminary magnitudes:

          Date       UT     t(days)   Rc   Err

          Oct. 6  00:10:41   1.503   19.66 0.04

     These magnitudes imply that the optical afterglow faded at a rate
of alpha = -1.08 during the four hours that these observations were
taken.  Combining these magnitudes with those of Weidinger et al.
(2002, GCN 1573) suggests that the optical afterglow has decayed with
a constant slope of alpha = -1.01 between 0.09 and 1.50 days after the
burst.  A plot of our preliminary Rc-band light curve is available at

K. Torii (RIKEN), T. Kato (Kyoto Univ.), and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ.)
report:

 In response to the GCN/HETE burst position notice, a part of the
error region of GRB 021004 (Shirasaki, et al., GCN 1565) was observed
by the automated system at RIKEN. Starting at 12:09:27 UT (193-s after
the burst trigger), 30-s exposures were repeated with the 0.20-m
reflector equipped with unfiltered CCD AP7p.

 Frequent passages of clouds significantly degraded the limiting
magnitudes of the data. The optical afterglow reported by Fox (GCN
1564) is not visible in our early phase images. Comparison with the
USNO-A2.0 red magnitudes gave the following 3-sigma upper limits for
the afterglow. Further analyses for the full data set are in progress.

We find that our point 1 is fainter than the magnitude extrapolated back
from the observations at later epochs (decay index 1.32, Weidinger et al.

transient source is clearly detected in the acquisition image with a 
magnitude V = 19.34 +/- 0.02 with respect to the USNO star at 00:26:58.713 
+18:56:56.61(Fox, GCN 1564) as calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583).

The polarimetric observations were obtained from October 5.080 to 5.149 UT 
(from 13.82 to 15.48 hours after the burst). We found linear polarization at 
the level of P = (1.26 +/- 0.10)% with position angle (114.2 +/- 2.2) degrees 
(uncertanties are 1-sigma errors).

The polarization induced by the interstellar matter in our Galaxy was 
estimated by field stars and accounts to P = (0.61 +/- 0.04)% with position 
angle (114.4 +/- 1.7) degrees. Once we remove the effect of ISM the intrinsic 
polarization of the optical transient turns out to be P = (0.65 +/- 0.11)% 
and position angle (114.4 +/-  4.6) degrees. Given that the field stars show 
a rather wide distribution in polarization degree and that the position angle 
for the stars and the optical transient are essentially the same, we can not 
rule out the possibility that the measured polarization is entirely due to 
the ISM in the Galaxy. This, in addition, leaves little room for host galaxy 
ISM induced polarization, that could account for at most a small fraction of 
the observed polarization.

"We have performed polarimetric observations of the afterglow of
GRB 021004 (Fox, GCN 1564; Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565) with the FORS1
instrument at the VLT. The observations were done between October 5.15
and October 5.20 UT in the V-band.
   Independently of Covino et al. (GCN 1595), we find a polarization value
for the OT of P = (1.32 +/- 0.28) %, with a position angle of theta =
(125 +/- 1) degrees.
   Correcting for possible polarization due to the interstellar medium is
rather difficult, since there are few bright stars close to the OT position.
Using 12 bright stars within 4.5 arcmin from this position, we find a mean
ISM polarization of P = (0.7 +/- 0.3) % and theta = (116 +/- 4) degrees.
The error in the degree of polarization is obtained from the spread in the
values found for the field stars.
   The resultant degree of polarization for the OT is P = (0.57 +/- 0.40) %.
Since this result could be entirely due to polarization induced by ISM,
we derive a 3-sigma upper limit of P = 1.2 % for the degree of
polarization.

     We have obtained deep Rc-band images of the field containing
GRB 021004 using the 2.56-meter Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma
on the evening of Oct. 6 UT.  The optical afterglow of GRB 021004
is visible in our images.  Using the comparison star from
Fox et al. (2002, GCN 1564) and the calibration of
Henden (2002, GNC 1583) we find the following preliminary magnitudes:

     These magnitudes, and those of Holland et al. (2002, GCN 2002),
imply that the optical afterglow faded at a rate a rate of alpha =
-0.9 between 32 and 58 hours after the burst.  We note that that the
optical afterglow appears to be fading less slowly than it did between
12 and 17 hours after the burst.  A deep Rc image constructed from all
of our data shows no evidence for a host galaxy.  A plot of our
preliminary Rc-band light curve is available at

R-band images of the afterglow associated with GRB 021004 (GCN 1564)
were obtained with the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope on
Oct. 7 between 02:43 and 11:09 UT. The afterglow seems to have stopped
fading.  We give below our last measurement from the night of Oct. 6

This could be due to the presence of a bright host galaxy, but PSF
fitting shows no residual as would be expected from an extended
source.  Furthermore, such a bright host galaxy would be in conflict
with the upper limits of Wood-Vasey et al. (GCN 1572).

Spectra of the GRB 021004 afterglow were obtained with the

MMT on Oct. 5.1, 5.3 and 6.3 UT. The spectra confirm two major MgII
absorption systems at z=1.38 and z=1.60 (GCN 1569, 1579, 1582). The moderate
resolution Magellan spectra show that the strong, unidentified line
at 515 nm is made of 3 components separated by 0.9 nm. The MMT spectra
extended to 330 nm and show no Lyman forest break implying a
limit to the redshift of z<1.7. 

The CIV absorption in the z=1.60 system is very strong with an
equivalent width of 0.5 nm (rest frame). There is another strong
line 2000 km/s to the blue of the CIV which may be  a second CIV
component. In addition, an emission line is detected at 405.2 nm forming
a P-Cygni profile with the CIV absorption. We conclude that the host
is a starburst galaxy.

write:

Analysis of the FREGATE data for GRB021004 (=H2380) shows that
the fluence-averaged photon number spectrum of the burst is well-fit
by a single power-law spectrum with slope alpha = 1.64 +/- 0.09, and
gives the following values for the fluences of the burst:

S = 1.8 x 10-6 erg cm-2 (50-300 keV), and

S = 3.2 x 10-6 erg cm-2 (7-400 keV).

Using the latter value and assuming Omega_Lambda = 0.7, Omega_m = 0.3,
and H_0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, the isotropic-equivalent energy of the
burst is

E_iso = 2.06 x 10^(52) ergs.

Using this value of E_iso and equation (1) of Frail et al. (ApJ 562,
L55, 2001) [see also Sari et al. (ApJ 519, L17, 1999)] to estimate the
jet break time, we find

t_j = 1.3 [(1+z)/2.60] (theta_j/0.070)^(8/3) [E_iso/2 x 10^(52) ergs]
           x (eta/0.2)^(-1/8) (n/0.1 cm-3)^(-1/8)  days.


Analysis of the WXM data for GRB021004 gives the following value for the
fluence of the burst in the WXM energy band:

S = 7.5 x 10-7 erg cm-2 (2-25 keV).

The fluence ratio S(2-25)/S(50-300)= (7.5 x 10-7)/(1.8 x 10-6) = 0.42
implies that GRB021004 is an X-ray rich GRB [log (S_x/S_gamma) > -0.5].

on behalf of a larger collaboration:

H band images of GRB 021004 were obtained at the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) on October 5, 6, and 7 UT.
Quick look photometry of the October 6 and 7 data show
continued fading of the OT, in contrast to the optical
behavior reported by Stanek et al (GCNC 1598)
over a very similar period.

Date	Time		H	err_H
--------------------------------------
Oct 6	12:26 UT	17.74 	0.05
Oct 7	11:31 UT	18.21	0.05

The errors are the error in 2MASS photometry of our
local photometric calibrator; hence the fading is known
more precisely than the absolute photometry,
and is about 0.47 +- 0.04 mags.

This implies that the transient became bluer from Oct.
6 to Oct 7, with a change in logarithmic spectral slope of
about 0.4.  This could correspond to the arrival of
fresh energy at the blast wave external shock,
carried by slow ejecta.
Interestingly, the color shift corresponds roughly to the
change between a frequency below and above the cooling break.

We thank David Griep, Bill Golisch, and John Rayner for
their invaluable assistance in obtaining these observations.

Using the R-magnitude calibration of Henden et al. (GCN #1583), we find 
the optical afterglow of GRB021004 at R = 20.4 +- 0.1.
Therefore, the decline seems to have started again after the halt remarked

R. Chornock and A. V. Filippenko, University of California, Berkeley,
report that optical spectra (range 300-940 nm) of the GRB 021004
afterglow (GCN 1564, 1565) were obtained with the Low Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck-I 10-m telescope on Oct. 8 UT.  We
detect the absorption lines due to Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II associated
with systems at z=1.381 and 1.603 previously noted (GCN 1569).  We
also detect the unidentified absorption lines at 463, 466, 510, and
514.5 nm reported in GCN 1579, as well as the narrow emission line at
405 nm and the absorption lines between 400 and 404 nm (GCN 1599).

We identify the emission line as Lyman-alpha at z=2.323, in
contradiction to the identification as C IV in GCN 1599.  We note that
P-Cygni absorption line profiles from a hypothetical starburst host
galaxy should not be prominent above the bright continuum of the
transient.  In addition, we feel that a lone UV emission line is
significantly more likely to be Lyman-alpha than C IV.  The
previously unidentified absorption lines can now be identified as the
Si IV 1393.8, 1402.8 Angstrom doublet and C IV 1548.2, 1550.8
Angstrom doublet.  These absorption lines have multiple velocity
components, as does the Lyman-alpha absorption.  We note the
wavelength coincidence of one of the components of Lyman-alpha with
the expected C IV absorption from the Mg II system at z=1.603, but
believe it only to be a coincidence.

An additional point in favor of the z=2.323 interpretation is the
appearance of the continuum to the blue of the Lyman-alpha line.
While there is no substantial Lyman break, there are many more
absorption lines blueward of Lyman-alpha than redward.  A previously
unnoted absorption feature with multiple components is present at
341 nm, consistent with Lyman-beta at this redshift.

N. (IASF-CNR), Pian E. (INAF-OATs), on behalf of a larger Italian
collaboration, report:

On Oct 6.05 UT, we observed the optical counterpart of GRB 021004
(Shirasaki et al., GCN 1565; Fox, GCN 1564) using the 3.6m TNG telescope
in the Canary Islands, with an R and an I filter. With respect to the
comparison star used by Fox and calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583), the
source has the following magnitudes:

UT     Band  Mag    Error
6.062  R     19.72  0.04
6.058  I     19.22  0.04

Our values are in good agreement with the nearly simultaneous
measurements of Holland et al. (GCN 1585), Bersier et al. (GCN 1586),
and Halpern et al. (GCN 1593).


To estimate the break time t_break of the light curve, we can use the
correlation discovered by Frail et al. (2001, ApJ, 562:L55), upon which
the standard energy reservoir result is based; this can be expressed
through

t_break = t_0 * (1+z) / E_iso

where t_0 = 22(+34)(-16) days and E_iso is the isotropic energy in units
of 10^52 ergs. The large error for t_0 originates from the intrinsic
dispersion (a factor of 2) in the distribution of beaming-corrected
energies (Frail et al. 2001). This result, however, holds independently
of the unknown jet opening angle, external density and radiative
efficiency.

Using the HETE-2 fluence (Lamb et al., GCN 1600), and assuming a
bolometric correction k = 1.3+-0.2 (calculated following Bloom, Frail &
Sari 2001, AJ, 121:2879), we can predict the break time for this
afterglow; we quote the results for the two reported values of the
redshift z:

1) z = 1.60 (Fox et al., GCN 1569):
   E_iso = 3.1*10^52 ergs;
   7.5 days < t_break < 47 days;
   t_break_best = 18.8 days.

2) z = 2.32 (Chornock & Filippenko, GCN 1605):
   E_iso = 5.6*10^52 ergs;
   5.3 days < t_break < 34 days;
   t_break_best = 13.4 days.

Given the slow average decline shown by this burst, this event should
remain bright longer than usual. Further observations are hence
encouraged.

larger GOSH collaboration:

GRB 020411 was observed from 14:00 to 23:00 UT on Oct 6 using the STIS
CCD spectrograph and G430L grism, and the NUV MAMA and prism.   The 
CCD spectrum shows two prominent absorption features, at 404.1 nm and
401.1 nm.    The first of these agrees well with a previously reported
feature that has been identified as Lyman alpha at z=2.323.  The second
absorption feature would then appear to be Si III at z=2.324, which
would
imply an offset of order 100 km/s in the restframe between the ionized
and neutral components.  

The NUV MAMA prism observation shows a break shortward of approximately 
303.0 nm, which would correspond to the Lyman limit of the z=2.323
system.  
Calibration of both the CCD and NUV MAMA observations may be improved
when all files from the observation are available to us.

Isabel Salamanca(1), Evert Rol(1), Ralph Wijers (1), Sara Ellison(2),
Lex Kaper(1), and Nial Tanvir (3) (1) University of Amsterdam (2)
Universidad Catolica de Chile (3) University of Hertfordshire, report:

We obtained a spectrum with the double arm spectrograph ISIS at the
4.2-m WHT telescope at La Palma (Spain) on October 4. A partial
calibration of the blue arm spectrum (2 Angstrom spectral resolution)
reveals the presence of four absorption components at detected in CIV
at redshifts 2.295, 2.298, 2.320, and 2.327, i.e. spanning a total
velocity range of approximately 3000 km/s.  The latter three
components are also clearly detected in SiIV, with a marginal
detection of SiIV at z=2.295.  The lines around 4000-4050 Angstrom can
be then identified as Ly-alpha (for which we also detect the emission
component reported earlier); there is a close match for the components
at z=2.320 and 2.327, whilst the two lowest redshift Lya components
are blended.

The interpretation of this 4-component absorption system could be of
absorption local to the burst source, or of cosmological components.

If all arise local to the burst, we must be viewing through ejecta in
a supernova-like explosion. After a day, supernova ejecta are so
opaque that we cannot see through them, and so we must be viewing the
results of an explosion that occurred weeks or more before the burst,
as in the supranova model. The narrowness of the components then must
mean that the ejecta have already cooled and partly condensed into
filaments. It is a challenge to have this happen within weeks, and
given the small filling factor inherent to filamentation, to have our
line of sight intersect four filaments.

If cosmological, we see our line of sight pass through 4 mass
concentrations of a magnitude well in excess of lyman limit systems in
quasar absorption line terms. These would all be local to the host
galaxy in cosmological terms, but with velocity separations large for
even a present-day massive cluster. Given that only 10-20% of quasars
at redshift 1 - 2 have even one such system, one concludes nonetheless
that seeing four systems implies a physical relation between them.
Thus we would be seeing a very large cosmic structure at z=2.3 with an
extent of 3000 km/s in velocity space. This is very difficult to get
in any cosmology, and would push cosmological models to very low
values of Omega_matter.

Further high-resolution spectroscopy is required to resolve the
velocity structure, and to determine the abundances and thermodynamic
state of these absorption systems, in order that we may understand the
nature of this remarkable system. In local models, one might find
variability in the Lyman-alpha emission.  Since the source is now
fading past R=21, these observations are most urgent.

E. Berger, S. R. Kulkarni D. A. Frail report on behalf of the larger
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"We have continued to monitor the radio afterglow of GRB 021004 (GCN 1574)
with the VLA at 8.5 and 22.5 GHz.  Combining our observations with the
Ryle Telescope 15 GHz measurements (GCN 1588) and the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer 86 GHz measurement (GCN 1590) we find a spectral slope
nu^0.9 between 8.5 and 86 GHz.  There is no sign of curvature in the range
of 8.5 to 86 GHz as would be expected for a transition from
optically-thick (nu^2) to optically-thin (nu^1/3) emission.

Millimetric emission from an underlying host galaxy could steepen the
spectrum (from the reasonably expected nu^1/3).  However, the upper limit
at 232 GHz from IRAM PdBI (GCN 1590) indicates that there is no
significant millimeteric emission from a host galaxy.

It therefore appears that the radio spectrum is unusual compared to the
radio afterglows of most other well-studied afterglows.  However, we note
that the early spectrum of the radio afterglow of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425
(Kulkarni et al. Nature 395, 663, 1998) also did not conform to the
synchrotron spectrum expected from a single power law electron energy
spectrum with uniform magnetic fields.  Multiple components or some other
emission mechanism may be needed to explain this unusual spectrum."

excellent agreement with the unusual value of beta=0.9 between 8.5 and 86

http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jules/021004.ps

Further examination of the optical spectrum reported by Chornock and Filippenko
(GCN #1605) yields the following features in the highest redshift system 
("em" refers to emission, "bl" denotes a broad blend of z=2.323 and 2.318):

	-------------------------------------------
	Line		Rest wavelength      z
	-------------------------------------------
	Ly beta		1025.7		   2.323 bl
					   2.291


	Ly alpha 	1215.7		   2.328 em

					   2.317

	Al II		1670.8		   2.328
	-------------------------------------------

This spectrum was taken in five 1200 s exposures from Oct 8 10:14-14:05 UT.
In view of the 6 Angstrom resolution of this spectrum, we consider that the
lowest redshift absorber of the three is a blend of two of the four systems that
were seen by Salamanca et al. (GCN #1611) in higher resolution data.  Also, we
detect one absorption line (Al II 1670) at the same redshift as the Ly alpha
emission, z=2.328, which we therefore designate the redshift of the host galaxy.
The detection of this lone low-ionization absorber is plausible because of its large 
oscillator strength, f=1.83.  Thus, all of the high-ionization absorbers are 
blueshifted from the host redshift, by up to 3,200 km/s.
   
The decay curve shows significant deviations from a power law, which might be
understood in terms of inhomogeneities in the ambient medium in which the afterglow 
expands.  In view of the revised redshift of 2.328 and the multiple blueshifted
H, C IV, and Si IV absorption lines, we hypothesize that the velocity span of
3,200 km/s in these components is indicative of a clumpy wind from a massive hot star
progenitor, such as a Wolf-Rayet star.  This would avoid the difficulties of scenarios 
involving supernova ejecta or cosmic clustering, as explained in GCN #1611.  The absence
of nitrogen lines and the presence of Ly alpha and Si IV weaker than C IV is consistent
with a WC star, in which the bulk of the wind is approximately equal parts He and C.

We assume a typical mass-loss rate of 10(-5) Msun/yr and a wind terminal velocity 
of 3,000 km/s.  Following Chevalier & Li (2000, ApJ, 536, 195), the predicted radius 
r_s of a spherical adiabatic blast wave in such a stellar wind at an observed time of
1 day is 3.5x10(17) cm for an isotropic energy of 5.6x10(52) erg (Malesani et al.,
GCN #1607), or 3.5x10(16) cm if there is a beaming correction of 1/100 to the energy.  
Chosing the larger value of r_s, the column density of C in the wind is at least
3.6x10(15) cm(-2) between the shock and the deceleration radius of the wind, which
is of order 5x10(17) cm or greater (Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2000, MNRAS, 327, 829).  This
would be enough to account for the observed absorption at high velocities.  We note that 
for a typical nu(-1) broad-band spectrum, C IV ions in the wind would absorb in the line 
before being photoionized.  Detailed photoionization models are needed to predict the 
evolution of the column densities.  A consequence of this model is that the high-velocity 
components of C IV should decline after being photoionized, or as the shock overruns the 
wind in several days.  Continued spectroscopic monitoring of this bright afterglow is
urged in order to search for this definitive signature of the massive star progenitor of 
GRBs.  Changes in the decay curve could also result when the afterglow reaches the 
termination of the stellar wind with the ISM."

Analysis of spectra of the OT + host galaxy associated with GRB 021004,
obtained by W. Sargent and R. Simcoe using the LRIS spectrograph at the
WMKO Keck-1 telescope, confirms the exitence of the multi-component z ~ 2.3
redshift systems reported by Chornock & Filippenko (GCN 1605), Salamanca
et al. (GCN 1611) and Mirabal et al. (GCN 1618).

For the emission component of the Ly-alpha line we measure the flux of
1.7e-16 cgs, which after the correction for the Galactic extinction becomes
2.2e-16 cgs.

This places the host galaxy of GRB 021004 in the top 0.5 to 1 percent of the
field galaxy population at comparable redshifts, in terms of the Ly-alpha
line flux (on the basis of data by A. Shapley, C. Steidel, et al., priv.
comm.)

In the currently popular cosmology with h = 0.65, Omega_0 = 0.3, and
Lambda_0 = 0.7, the luminosity distance is 6.2e28 cm, and the inferred
Ly-alpha luminosity is 1.1e+43 erg/s.  Using the standard conversion, this
corresponds to an unobscured star formation rate of 15 M_sun/yr.  However,
this is certainly a lower limit, since the blue half of the Ly-alpha line is
absorbed, there is an unknown atennuation factor due to the resonant
scattering and absorption, and an unknown, fully obscured star formation
component.  Thus, the true SFR in the host is at least twice as high, and
could be an order of magnitude higher (or more).

We observed the optical counterpart to GRB 021004 (Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565; 
Fox, GCN 1564) on October 8.225 (89.3 hours after the GRB trigger). The 
observations were performed with the ESO VLT-UT3 (Melipal) telescope equipped 
with FORS1 and a Bessel V filter in the imaging polarimetry mode. The 
transient source is clearly detected with a magnitude V = 20.89 +/- 0.03 with 
respect to the USNO star at 00:26:58.713 +18:56:56.61 (Fox, GCN 1564) as 
calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583).

The polarimetric observations allowed us to single out linear polarization at 
the level of P = (0.67 +/- 0.23)% with position angle (89.0 +/- 10.0) degrees 
(uncertainties are 1-sigma errors) for the optical transient. The field star 
polarization was of course constant within the errors between our two 
polarimetric observations (Covino et al. GCN 1595). 
Once we remove the estimated polarization induced by the interstellar matter 
(ISM) in our Galaxy, as discussed in our GCN 1595, the intrinsic polarization 
of the optical transient turns out to be consistent with zero. 

Independently of any ISM induced polarization, the present result compared to 
the polarimetric observations performed on October 5.115 [Covino et al. GCN 
1595, P = (1.26 +/- 0.1)%, angle = (114.2 +/- 2.2) degrees] and 5.175 [Rol et 
al. GCN 1596, P = (1.32 +/- 0.28)%, angle = (125 +/- 1) degrees] could show  
a marginal hint for a change of the polarization degree and of the position 
angle.

M. Sako, F. A. Harrison report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO collaboration:

We report TOO observations of GRB021004 taken with the High-Energy
Transmission Grating (HETG) on the Chandra X-ray observatory.  Chandra
observed the afterglow for a total exposure of 87 ksec, beginning at
8:55 UT on October 5, 20.5 hours after the burst.  A preliminary
reduction of the data shows a fading X-ray source at the position of
the optical transient.  The count rate decreased with time throughout
the observation with a power law decay time slope of -1.0 +/- 0.2.
The total HEG + MEG countrate is 0.018 counts sec^-1.  The source is
well-characterized by a power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma =
2.1 +/- 0.1, and flux normalization of 1.9 +/- 0.1 x 10^-4 photons
cm^-2 s^-1 keV^-1 at 1 keV.  There are no signs of excess absorption
above the Galactic value.  The corresponding mean 2 - 10 keV X-ray
flux in the observed frame is 4.3 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.  The
0th-order ACIS-S spectrum is consistent with that of the HETG, with an
average count rate of 0.014 counts sec^-1.

No obvious discrete features are detected in the spectrum.  We note
that the signal-to-noise ratio in this spectrum is a factor of two
better than that of the GRB991216 spectrum obtained with the Chandra
HETG, so that a line feature of similar strength to that reported for
GRB991216 should have been detected.

We thank Harvey Tananbaum for approving director's discretionary time
for this observation, and the staff at the Chandra Science Center
for skillfully implementing this rapid TOO observation.

DATE:    02/10/12 16:26:34 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on the behalf of the USNO GRB team:

Two additional photometric nights of UBVRcIc all-sky photometry
for the 11x11 arcmin field centered at the afterglow coordinates
for GRB021004 (Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565; Fox et al. GCN 1564)
have been aquired with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope.  Stars brighter
than V=14.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
The photometric data on the NOFS anonymous ftp site has
been updated:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb021004.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

The comparison star given by Fox et al. has the following
updated coordinates, magnitudes and colors:

6.744892  18.948922 00:26:58.77  +18:56:56.1  J2000

    V     B-V    U-B    V-R   R-I     errors
  16.258  1.172  1.115  0.720 0.642   0.006 0.028 0.034 0.015 0.023

These colors suggest an approximate K5 spectral classification.

One possibility for the various bumps in the afterglow lightcurve
(suggested privately by B. Schaefer, D. Reichart and P. Price),
is that the Fox et al. comparison star is variable.
This has been investigated by performing differential
photometry with respect to an ensemble of other comparison
stars on the three photometric nights.  The BV results are
given below.

     HJD       V     B-V    verr   bverr
  52552.9804 16.256  1.172  0.003  0.006

  52557.9315 16.255  1.173  0.002  0.004

The datapoint at HJD 2452556.9312 was contaminated by
a cosmic ray hit and so should be given lower weight.
All other measures indicate that the comparison star
is constant over the three nights of observation.  Unless
this star was doing something different between UTD 021005
and UTD 021009, there is no evidence that the afterglow
lightcurve changes are due to comparison star variation.
Using more than one comparison star (or at least including
a check star) when performing differential photometry, and also
selecting comp stars that are close to the program object in
magnitude and color space, is always recommended
to guard against possible variability of any comparison star.

"Starting on October 05 2002 01:37 UT we have obtained high resolution
spectra (R=50,000, 6 km/s in the observer frame) of the optical
afterglow of GRB021004 (Fox et al., GCN #1564) using UVES at VLT.  The
observations cover the full spectral range 3200-9800 Angstrom, in good
seeing conditions. At the time of the observations the afterglow
magnitude was R~18.6 and B~19.0.

A preliminary analysis of the first hour of observation reveals
several absorption lines associated with at least 4 metal systems
(also see Salamanca et al., GCN #1611).

The z=2.321,2.327 system is probably very close to the GRB itself or
the circumburst medium. C IV absorption lines associated with this
system are in fact extremely strong and complex, spanning a velocity
range of about 1000 km/s. This system may show the so called "line
locking", possibly relativistic, effect, where the second component of
the z=2.321 C IV doublet is "locked" to the first component of the
z=2.327 C IV doublet. This effect has been observed in the past in
narrow absorption systems associated with high redshift quasars (e.g.
Wampler 1991, ApJ, 368, 40) and O stars (Lucy & Solomon, 1970, ApJ,
159, 879).

Low ionization lines of AlII1670 and possibly SiII1526 are also
detected in the red wing of the z=2.327 component. Low ionization
lines are not detected in the lower redshift system at z=2.321.

The z=2.2958,2.2985 system is shifted by ~2500 km/s blueward of the
strong z=2.321,2.327 system and shows much weaker, but still very
strong, C IV lines and no low ionization lines. The velocity range of
this absorption is of about 300 km/s.

The z=1.6019 intervening system shows a narrow Al III absorption with
column density of log N(AlIII)=13.2 +\- 0.1 and Doppler parameter b=12
+\- 1 km/s.

The other system at z=1.38 shows a complex structure with at least 4
components spanning a velocity range of about 200 km/s.  The FeII
column densities suggest that this system may be associated with a
Damped Lyman Alpha system in the interstellar medium of an intervening
galaxy."

"We have obtained a 7200-s spectrum with the FORS1

Paranal on Oct 11.125-11.231 UT. The range is 3500-

We confirm the detection of the Ly-alpha (1215.7 A)
emission line plus the C IV (1548,2 A, 1550.8 A)
absorption line system at a redshift z = 2.327 (GCN
1605). The Al II (1670 A) absorption line (GCN 1618)
is detected as well at the same redshift.

We also detect another two absorption line systems at
z = 2.297 and z = 2.321 on the basis of C IV (1548,2 A,
1550.8 A) lines.  The latter system is also detected in
Si IV (1393.8, 1402.8).  These two systems are consistent
with those reported by Salamanca et al. (GCN 1611) and
Savaglio et al. (GCN 1633).

The flux of the Ly-alpha line (1.9e-16 erg/cm2/s/A) is
comparable with the one measured by Keck (GCN 1620),
i.e. the Lyman-alpha flux is constant and we conclude that
arises from the GRB 021004 host galaxy, at z = 2.327."

Masetti N. (IASF-CNR), Pian E. (INAF-OATs), on behalf of a larger Italian

On Oct ~16.9 UT, we observed the optical counterpart of GRB 021004 (Shirasaki 
et al., GCN 1565; Fox, GCN 1564) using the 3.6m TNG telescope in the Canary 
Islands; observations were performed with V (20 min), R (9 min) and I (15 
min) filters under mediocre conditions (seeing 1.5-1.8 arcsec, thin clouds). 
With respect to the comparison star used by Fox and calibrated by Henden (GCN 
1583), the source has the following magnitudes:


UT      Band  Mag    Error
--------------------------
16.979  I     21.65  0.12
16.942  R     22.38  0.20
16.962  V     22.49  0.07


The object is quite faint in our images. Actually, it lies about ~0.7 mag 
below the powerlaw extrapolation of the previously published data (R band), 
if we include the three early-time data points of Fox (t < 20 min). If 
instead we let the powerlaw fit to begin ~2 hours after the trigger, there is 
no disagreement. A light curve with the relevant fits is reported at 
http://www.merate.mi.astro.it/~malesani/GRB/021004 .


If indeed a break has occured between Oct 10 and Oct 17 (6 to 13 days after 
GRB), this is in agreement with the prediction of GCN 1607.


Further observation are encouraged to assess the nature of this break.

We have observed GRB 021004 on October 8, 2002 four days after the burst,
using 1-m Zeiss telescope and CCD with Rc filter under good seeing
conditions. Five 20-min exposures were taken in the time interval between
20:49:56 and 22:35:14 UT. Object is seen near the frame limit in each of
these frames. The photometry and astrometry of images were performed. The
sum of all frames (total exposure is 100 minutes) gives the magnitude of OT

Rc = 20.9 +/- 0.3

relative to comparison star by Fox (GCN 1564) with Henden's (GCN 1630)
calibration magnitude of 15.538 Rc.

The astrometry of all the frames taken both on October, 4 (GCN 1606) and
October, 8 shows that the image of the object is displaced by 0".5 West on
October, 8 relative to that on October, 4. The accuracy of the astrometry is
0".2. One may suggest that the displacement results from influence of a host
galaxy.

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004
(Fox et al. GCN 1564) with the 1.8m Vatican Advanced
Technology Telescope beginning 2002 Oct 26.25 (UT).
Seven, 10 minute exposures in the R band were combined
and an unresolved source was detected within 0.2"
of the afterglow position. Assuming the star at
00:26:51.44 18:54:36.3 (2000) has a magnitude of
R=17.142 (Henden GCN 1630) we find the afterglow
brightness to be R=23.39+/-0.12. Combining the
Williams, Lindsay, & Milne (GCN 1652) observation with
the VATT image provides a power-law decay index of -1.7
between one and three weeks after the burst. This is
significantly steeper than the "average" decay index
between 0.4 and 3 days after the burst (Holland et al.
GCN 1597) and may indicate a final break in the light
curve. Although, the odd variability of GRB 021004 makes 
this conclusion uncertain.

of which 1 - 2 photons are estimated to be background events.  Assuming the
same power-law spectral index as that observed during an earlier Chandra observation
(GCN 1624), this corresponds to a 2 - 10 keV flux of (7.2 +/- 2.5) x 10^-16
erg/cm2/s.  The source, therefore, has decayed with a characteristic power
law decay time slope of approximately -1.7 since the previous observation.

The data can be accessed through the Chandra Data Archive.  We thank Harvey
Tananbaum for allocating Director's Discretionary Time and the Chandra X-ray
Center for implementing the obervation.

TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1717
SUBJECT: GRB021004, late time optical observations

T.A. Fatkhullin, V.N. Komarova, A.V. Moiseev (SAO RAS) report for the
larger GOSH collaboration:


The field of the GRB 021004 optical transient was observed with the SCORPIO
instrument at the 6-m telescope of SAO RAS. The images were taken
starting from 15:30 to 17:45 UT on Nov 29 and from 18.55 to 20.00 UT on Nov 30
under conditions of thin cirrus with seeing of about 1.2 arcsec in the first
night and 1.5 arcsec in the second one. The V, Rc and Ic filters were used.
The absolute astrometry was done relatively to USNO-B1.0 stars with internal
error of 0.3 arcsec. We detect an object which coincides with the position
of the optical transient (Henden et al. GCN #1592)  within the astrometric
error. Photometric calibration was performed using 6 standards
(Henden et al. GCN #1630) in our FOV.
The results of the photometry are given below:

 Data    Filter  Exp.       OT mag.     Aperture
------------------------------------------
 29 Nov   Rc   15x180s   24.36+/-0.18   3.5 arcsec
 29 Nov    V    5x450s   24.53+/-0.18   3.5 arcsec
 30 Nov   Ic   14x120s   >23.9
------------------------------------------

At this stage it is not clearly whether the object is the pure host
galaxy. Further observations are planned.

SUBJECT: GRB 021004: HST observations
DATE:    03/05/21 11:37:48 GMT
FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <anl@star.le.ac.uk>

Andrew Levan (U. Leicester/STScI), Andrew Fruchter (STScI), Johan Fynbo
(U. Aarhus), Paul Vreeswijk (ESO) and Javier Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC/STScI)
report for the GOSH collaboration.

The field of GRB 021004 has been observed using the ACS/WFC on HST
in four epochs: the 7th, 11th and 22nd Oct and 26th Nov 2002.

A difference image of the last two epochs, which were dithered, reveals a
declining point source whose position is consistent within the astrometric
errors (~0."01) with the peak of the light in the later image.  The source
is marginally resolved in that image (with a FWHM of 0".11, compared to a
point source FWHM of ~0."09) indicating a host galaxy directly underlying
the OT. This differs from the astrometry of Mirabal et al
(astro-ph/0303616) who find the OT position well offset from the host. As
the source lies on the peak of the light, and the object is only
marginally resolved, it is possible that the OT continues to contribute
significantly to the observed brightness even at the later epoch. Hence
the magnitude found for the source in November, F606W(AB)=24.3 +/- 0.1,
is an upper limit on the true brightness of the host galaxy.

We have scheduled late time observations of GRB 021004 which will enable
an accurate determination of both the host galaxy magnitude and the late
time decay of the afterglow.
