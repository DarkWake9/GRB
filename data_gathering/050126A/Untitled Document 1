"A further examination of our Keck/NIRC image obtained on January 26.687
UT (4.5 hours after the burst; GCN 2985) and a comparison to the revised
XRT position (GCN 2996) reveals a point source which is not present in DSS
or 2MASS.  The object is located about 1.9 arcsec from the nominal XRT
position at (J2000):
        RA = 18:32:27.17
        DEC= 42:22:13.6
We note that the previous source identified in GCN 2985 as the possible
afterglow of GRB 050126 falls outside of the revised XRT position.  At the
present we do not have additional observations to test whether either
object has faded."

report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have obtained a new XRT position, using the ground-based pipeline
processing software, including stellar aberration correction.  The analysis
is based on 4 different orbits and the source is detected each time. 
Although
in the last orbits we have only few counts the derived coordinates are very
consistent and differ by less than 5 arcseconds.

The new position for the X-ray afterglow is:

RA(J2000) = 18:32:27.0,
Dec(J2000) = +42 22 13.5

We estimate a remaining uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds, including a
systematic error of about 5 arcseconds due to residual alignment offsets
that have not been fully calibrated yet.

D. A. Frail (NRAO) and A. M. Soderberg (Caltech) report on behalf of
the Caltech-NRAO-Carnegie GRB Collaboration:

"We have used the VLA to make observations of the XRT error circle
(GCN #2984) for the Swift burst GRB050126 (GCN #2987). The
observations were carried out on 2005 January 26.67 UT (4 hrs after
the burst) and January 28.59 UT. At a frequency of 8.46 GHz no
emission was detected above 135 microJy (4-5 sigma) within the
30-arcsec diameter error circle. At the position of the NIR afterglow
candidate found by Berger and Kulkarni (GCN #2985) there is no
emission in excess of 30-45 microJy.

No further observations are planned."

on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 12:00:53 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050126.  The spacecraft autonomously slewed to the
burst and was detected by Swift/XRT as well (Kinnea et al., GCN #2984).

The burst is a FRED-type single broad peak, with a rapid rise (~1 sec)
and total duration ~30 seconds (T50 = 14 sec, T90 = 26 sec).  The
total fluence is 1.1e-6 erg/cm2 (15-350 keV), and the peak five second
flux is 0.4 ph/cm2/sec (15-350 keV).  The spectrum is consistent with
a power law with photon index 1.3 +/- 0.1 in the 20-150 keV band.

The spacecraft slew occurred between times 12:01:41 and 12:02:32 UT,
with a subsequent settling period until 12:03:02 UT.  From 12:02:32
onward, there is no detectable gamma ray emission with an approximate
2 sigma upper limit of 7e-9 erg/cm2/s (15-350 keV) based on the above
spectrum.

The BAT ground-derived position is RA,Dec = 278.111, 42.384 (J2000)
with an estimated uncertainty of 4 arcmin (radius, 3-sigma, including
a systematic uncertainty).  This is within 62 arcsec of the XRT
position (GCN #2984), and within 22 arcsec of the BAT on-board derived
position.

The Swift XRT instrument reports a preliminary position for GRB 
050126.  The BAT detected this burst at 12:00:53 UT on January 26, 
2005.  The S/C slewed to the burst immediately.  The XRT was in Manual 
State taking calibration observations of Mkn 876 in PC mode at the time of 
the slew.  We settled on the BAT position at 12:03:04 and immediately began 
taking data in PC mode until 12:07:42, when we entered the South Atlantic 
Anomaly.  During this four minute period the XRT detected a very bright and 
rapidly fading X-ray source.  The initial position, based on the raw image 
data with no correction for stellar aberration, is:

RA(J2000) = 18:32:25.8
Dec(J2000) = +42:22:0.4.

The estimated uncertainty in this early position is 30 arcseconds.  A more 
accurate position will be sent out when we are able to process these data 
through the pipeline software.
