At 10:05:37.96 UTC (36337.96 s UT) on 3 Sep 2002, the HETE WXM and SXC
instruments detected event H2314, an X-ray flash.  The WXM flight
localization was correct but was not set out as a GCN Notice because
events which trigger only the WXM are currently not sent out, in order
not to overwhelm the community with X-ray burst localizations.  Ground
analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a refined location,
which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 13:56:24 UT, 231 minutes
after the burst.  The WXM location can be expressed as a 90% confidence
circle that is 16.6 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 22h 49m 25s, Dec = -20o 53' 59" (J2000).


Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a
one-dimensional localization, which -- when combined with the WXM
localization -- produced a further refinement in the location.  This
refined location was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 17:00:34 UT,
7 hrs after the burst.  The refined location produced by combining the
SXC and WXM localizations can be expressed as a 90% confidence
quadrilateral that is 4 arcminutes in width and ~31 arcminutes in
length, is centered at


RA = 22h 49m 01s, Dec = -20o 55' 47" (J2000).

and is defined by

RA = 22h 48m 48.00  -20o 39' 36.0"
RA = 22h 48m 33.60  -20o 42' 36.0"
RA = 22h 49m 10.80  -21o 10' 12.0"
RA = 22h 49m 30.00  -21o 10' 48.0"


In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~3.3 seconds.
The WXM localization SNR was ~10.  The SXC localization SNR was ~3.

Berger and F. Harrison, S. Yost (Caltech); M. Hamuy and S. Shectman (OCIW);
E. Armstrong, C. Espaillat N. Mirabal and J. Halpern (Columbia); and
J. Kemp (Joint Astronomy Center and Columbia) report:

We imaged the entire error-box of XRF 020903 with the Palomar 200-inch
telescope + Large Format Camera (LFC) on Sep 4.3 UT (epoch 1) and Sep 10.3
UT (epoch 2) in Steidel R-band.  Visual comparison of these images with
the Digitised Sky Survey and with each other did not reveal any obvious
transient.  Recently, we undertook a more detailed analysis, namely
PSF-matched image subtraction of these two epochs, and found
an optical transient (OT) located at coordinates:

	  RA: 22:48:42.34   Dec: -20:46:09.3   J2000

with a bright elliptical galaxy 4 arcsec SE (hereafter G2).

The source is also present in images from the MSO 50-inch telescope
(GCN #1533) when the second epoch LFC image is subtracted.

Upon discovery of the OT, we immediately pursued further observations,
thereby obtaining a third epoch of imaging with the MDM 1.3-meter
telescope on Sep 28.3 UT in the R-band.  Initial photometry demonstrates
that the object has re-brightened by ~ 0.3-0.4 mag between epochs 2 and
3.  We propose that this optical rebrightening is from an associated
supernova, peaking between ~7-24 days after the initial XRF trigger.

Spectroscopic observations by M. Hamuy and S. Shectman for the source were
also obtained with the Magellan 6.5m telescopes (Baade+LDSS2, Clay+B&C) on
Sep 28.1 UT.  We detect narrow emission lines from an underlying host
galaxy (hereafter G1) are (Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, [O III], [Ne III],
[O II]) at a mean redshift of z = 0.25 +/- 0.01.  Subtraction of the
emission lines reveals a continuum that is consistent with a SN-like
transient near maximum.  In particular, the spectrum reveals
deficit of emission at rest wavelengths < 4000A, as would be expected
from a SN.

Spectra of G2 (R ~ 17 mag) reveal it to be an elliptical galaxy at
z = 0.23 and therefore is not associated with the optical transient.

If the OT is indeed associated with XRF020903, it is the first known
optical afterglow of an XRF, and may be the most nearby cosmological high
energy transient known yet.  Parenthetically we note that microlensing
from G2 may result in sharp variations of the light curve (see
Garnavich, Loeb and Stanek, 2000). We encourage further monitoring of
this OT/SN.

E. Berger, S. R. Kulkarni, D. A. Frail, A. Soderberg, P. A. Price, D. W.
Fox, F. A. Harrison, and S. Yost report on behalf of the larger
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

Following the discovery of the optical transient of GRB 020903 (GCN #1530)
by Soderberg et al. (GCN #1554), we observed the position of the OT with
the VLA on Sep. 27.22 UT.  We detect a bright radio source at the position
of the OT, with a flux of 1.1 mJy at 8.46 GHz.  The source is not detected
in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) above
their flux limit of 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz.  Observations undertaken today (Sep.
29.11 UT) show that the source is fading with a flux of 0.7 mJy at 8.46
GHz.

The variable radio counterpart lends supports to the identification of the
optical transient (OT) reported by Soderberg et al. as the afterglow of
XRF 020903.  Unlike the optical emission, the radio emission is dominated
by the afterglow.

The isotropic, prompt energy release of XRF 020903 (using the redshift of
z=0.25, GCN #1554, and a rough estimate of the fluence detected by WXM;
see the HETE-2 web page: http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/GRB020903/) is
well below those of typical cosmological GRBs but higher than that of GRB
980425.  Therefore, the energy in relativistic ejecta of XRF 020903 is
intermediate between that of SN1998bw, about 10^49 erg, as inferred from
the radio emission (Kulkarni et al. 1998, Nature, 395, 663), and that of
typical cosmological GRBs.  Finally, the ratio of energy in the
relativistic ejecta to the energy in the SN of XRF 020903 is well below
those of cosmological GRBs (typically 1-10), but higher than SN1998bw
(~0.01). These arguments suggest that XRF 020903 is a "transition" object
-- a link between GRB 980425 and comsological GRBs.

Scaling the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity of SN1998bw to XRF 020903,
we predict detectable X-ray emission on this timescale, which may be an
additional robust indicator of the relativistic energy in the ejecta.

A. Gal-Yam (Tel Aviv University) reports:

"We have extracted from the USNO plate archive
(http://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/) two blue plates, covering the
location of the variable object possibly connected with XRF 020903,
reported by Soderberg et al (GCN 1554). Inspecting these plates we find
the following:

1) A plate obtained on UT 1977.6 reveals an object, coincident with the
variable source reported by Soderberg et al. The B-band magnitude of this
object appears to be about one magnitude fainter than that of the nearby
galaxy noted as "G2" by these authors.

2) Comparison of the 1977 plate with the (much poorer) POSSI blue plate
obtained on 1954.6 may suggest a variation of the flux ratio between the
source coincident with the Soderberg et al. variable, and the galaxy G2,
with G2 being brighter on the 1977 plate, but possibly fainter than the
source reported by Soderberg et al., in 1954. This may hint that this
source was variable in the past. We stress, however, that the 1954 data
are quite poor, so past variability can not be ascertained at this stage.

GIF Cutouts from both plates, showing the area around the Soderberg et al.
variable, can be obtained from ftp://wise3.tau.ac.il/pub/avishay/xrf.
These can be compared with the Palomar data shown by Soderberg at
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~ams/XrF.html.

The source detected on the 1977 plate may be hard to interpret as a
possible "host" galaxy for the Soderberg et al. transient, even if we
disregard its possible past variability. Soderberg et al. report that this
source is not detected on POSSII red plates, and estimate a magnitude of
R=22 from their OT+SN+host model. This fact can be reconciled with the
1977 B-band data, showing this object only about 1 magnitude fainter than
G2 (which has R=17 mag), if this object has a very blue B-R color.
However, this appears to be in contradiction with the Magellan spectrum
presented by Soderberg et al., which is flat, or possibly even red, in
B-R.

An alternative explanation fitting both the archival analysis and the
entire data set presented by Soderberg et al. and Berger et al (GCN 1555)
is that this source is a variable radio-loud AGN. We have recently shown
(Gal-Yam et al. 2002, PASP, 114, 587) that such objects can appear to be
very similar to optical transients associated with GRBs. Further
inspection of archival data, as well as further observations (B-band
especially), can distinguish between an OT+SN model, and an AGN, according
to their variability properties.

If an AGN, the source discovered by Soderberg et al. may still be related
to XRF 020903. However, in that case, a SN component no longer seems to be
required.

Until this issue is clarified, we urge some caution in interpreting the
Soderberg et al. data set as evidence for a connection between XRF 020903
and a SN.

by the United States Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station

We observed the field of  XRF 020903 on both September 3.1 and 9.1 (UT) using
the Mosaic imager on the CTIO 4-m telescope.  Images were taken in B, R and I
on the first night and in only R on the second.  An image subtraction
performed shortly after the second night showed no variability consistent with
that expected of a GRB/XRF.  

In light of the report of the possible discovery of a counterpart to this
object (GCN 1554) we have re-examined our data.    We find that the object
cited as the possible counterpart declined by approximately 0.2 mags in R
between our two epochs.   

Unfortunately, we do not have a reliable absolute calibration of the field at
this moment.  We expect that a better calibration and more complete analysis
will be available on a relatively short timescale.

We find the following magnitudes with respect to the USNO stars (1) and
(2) reported in the finding chart of Soderberg et al. (see

I       29.937  4.50+-0.13  5.85+-0.13

In the I-band image (300 s exposure), the object is barely visible.
Using the USNO R-magnitudes for the stars 1 (R = 16.0) and 2 (R = 17.1),
we find

R = 18.55 +- 0.2  @29.931 UT (26.5 days after XRF),

where the error is mainly due to calibration. More accurate photometry
will be distributed when available. Our data suggest further brightening
between 28.3 and 29.9 UT, with respect to the value found in Soderberg
et al. web page.

With present data, we cannot say if the varying source is a rising
supernova or a variable radio-loud AGN, as suggested by Gal-Yam (GCN

We have found that the star named (2) in our previous circular (GCN

K. Torii (RIKEN) and H. Yamaoka (Kyushu Univ.) report:

 The entire WXM error circle of XRF 020903 (Ricker, et al. GCN 1530)
was observed at RIKEN with the 0.25-m reflector equipped with
unfiltered cooled CCD AP6E. The observation started at 2002 September
3.6479 UT (5.23 hours after the burst trigger) and 20-s exposures were
repeated.

 The first 168 frames, obtained between 3.6479 and 3.6965 UT, have
been stacked and inspected for the variable source (hereafter VS)
found by Soderberg, et al. (GCN 1554). In our image (4".2/pixel) a
spatially unresolvable source is detected at (R.A., Dec.) =
(22:48:42.37, -20:46:13.0) (J2000). The position is derived by using
12 comparison stars from UCAC1 and the fitting error is 0".3 in both
coordinates. This position is closer to the galaxy G2 (as tabulated in
USNO-A2.0) rather than to the VS.

 We also find that the flux for the spatially unresolved G2+VS was
2.0+/-0.2 mag fainter than the star 1 in the finding chart of
Soderberg et al. (GCN 1554), which is consistent with the magnitude
difference (G2 - star 1 = +2.17) in GSC-2.2.1 F magnitude. These
results, both astrometrically and photometrically, show that the VS
was much fainter than the galaxy G2 during our observation.

Based on the photometry performed at the TNG, we re-analyzed data obtained on 
Sep., 29.9 UT with the Asiago telescope (GCN 1561). Seeing conditions were 
mediocre (about 2 arcsec) and airmass about 2. Magnitudes were again derived 
by PSF fitting photometry. We report the following results for the VS:

Filter  UT      Magnitude
-----------------------------
 V      29.923  20.94 +- 0.12
 R      29.931  20.42 +- 0.10
 I      29.937  19.98 +- 0.13

The source has simultaneously faded by about 0.2 mag in all V, R and I bands 
between Sep 29.9 and Oct 1.9. Comparing with the R-band measurement by 
Soderberg et al. on Sep 28.3, the source appears fainter by more than 1 
magnitude.


A color-color diagram, together with a BVRI spectrum and a light curve are 
shown at the web page: http://www.merate.mi.astro.it/~malesani/XRF020903 .

The values reported here supersede those in our GCN 1561, that were based on a 
misidentification of the reference star. We apologize for any inconvenience 
this may have caused.

Detailed analsys of these data is still in progress, and more observations 
will be performed in the next few days.

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 20x20 arcmin field centered at the variable object coordinates
for XRF020903 (Ricker et al. GCN 1530; Soderberg et al. GCN 1554)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=14.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/xrf020903.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

While the night was photometric, the XRF field is towards
our southern horizon and so there is a higher risk of
zeropoint errors.  We estimate the present zeropoint errors to
be about 0.03mag.  We will be extending this
calibration with additional nights to ensure against
a systematic zeropoint error.  You should check the dates on
the .dat file prior to final publication to get the latest photometry.

In particular, the two stars marked on Soderberg et al. finding
chart have the following position and magnitudes:

           RA (J2000) DEC           V     B-V    V-R   R-I
Star 1  22:48:36.05  -20:44:34.8  16.381  0.789  0.455 0.399
Star 2  22:48:53.48  -20:43:23.1  14.743  0.466  0.304 0.313

These values match closely those given in Covino et al. (GCN 1563).

Calibration of the GRB021004 field will occur around October 9 UT.

FROM:    Ryan Chornock at UC Berkeley  <chornock@astro.berkeley.edu>

R. Chornock and A. V. Filippenko, University of California, Berkeley, report
that an optical spectrum (range 300-940 nm) of the proposed optical transient
(OT) associated with XRF 020903 (GCN 1554) was obtained with the Low Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck-I 10-m telescope on Oct. 8 UT.  Our spectrum
is similar to that obtained by Hamuy & Shectman (GCN 1554), revealing a rich
set of narrow emission lines associated with the host galaxy. The host is
clearly a low-metallicity, high-excitation starburst galaxy, with high
[O III]/H-beta and low [N II]/H-alpha intensity ratios; [Ne III] is also
visible. The shape of the underlying continuum suggests the presence of an
older population of stars as well. While we cannot yet rule out a contribution
from an optical supernova (rather than some other type of OT), at this time
there is little if any direct spectroscopic evidence for supernova
features. Specifically, the deficit at rest wavelengths below 4000A (mentioned
in GCN 1554) is consistent with a population of old to intermediate-age stars.

M. Andersen (AIP Potsdam), J.M. Castro Cerón (ROA, San Fernando), 
A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC) report:

We have imaged the transient source present in the field of XRF 020903
(GCN 1530, GCN 1554) with the 1.54-m Danish Telescope around Oct 10.2
UT, yielding the following preliminary BVR-band magnitudes:

    B = 21.89 +/- 0.15
    V = 21.07 +/- 0.12
    R = 20.54 +/- 0.12

The observations we carried out with a mean seeing of 1". The 
zeropoint is based on the calibration given in GCN 1571. These
magnitudes agree with the ones measured on Oct 1.9 UT for the
transient source (GCN 1563). 

The source seems slightly elongated in the North-East direction
at can be seen in at:

http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb020903/FCs/grb020903.R2.gif

Thus, our measurements are consistent with i) a flattening of the 
light curve due to an underlying host or ii) with a transitory plateau
phase spanning at least 8.3 days (from Oct 1.9 to Oct 10.2 UT).

The elongated appearance of the object supports the first hypothesis (i).
A combination of both effects could be also possible.

Further observations are planned.

FROM:    Andrew Levan at U.of Leicester  <anl@star.le.ac.uk>

Andrew Levan (U. Leicester/STScI), Andrew Fruchter, Lou Strolger, Ingunn
Burud and James Rhoads (STScI) report for the GOSH collaboration.

The candidate optical transient for XRF 020903 (Soderberg et al, GCN 1554)
was imaged with HST/ACS in F606W on 3rd Dec 2002. 4 dithered exposures
were obtained with a total exposure time of 1840s.

The candidate appears to be within an irregular galaxy, with four
(possibly interacting) components. Astrometry with images obtained
with the CTIO 4-m telescope and Mosaic imager on Sept 4th and 9th 2002
(Fruchter et al, GCN 1558) shows that the transient source is located at
a position coincident with the peak of the most western of these compact
knots (with a positional accuracy of approximately ~0."1). The knot has
an F606W AB magnitude of 22.6 and a FWHM of ~0."14, greater than the PSF
of ACS. Hence the source is resolved at this resolution, indicating that
an AGN does not dominate the optical light from this object.

The galaxy, named G2 by Soderberg et al, (GCN 1554) is clearly an
interacting system. However, as noted by Soderberg et al the redshift
difference (z=0.23 for G2 and z=0.25 for the host of the candidate OT)
indicate that the systems are not associated.

Using a 1" aperture the magnitude of the entire system in F606W is
approximately R=21, roughly consistent with the late time magnitudes
determined by Gorosabel et al (GCN 1631).

Observations taken at a later date will allow a search for further
variability in this source.

DATE:    04/10/04 16:16:04 GMT
FROM:    Sabrina Savage at U of Wyoming  <sander@uwyo.edu>

We observed XRF 020903 with the CTIO 0.9-inch 32, 35, and 37 days
after the burst
and with the USNO 1.0-meter 32 and 60 days after the burst. We find no
evidence
for a rebrightening at these times.  Zero points for the g' and r'
filters used 
for the CTIO 0.9-meter images were taken from Smith, J. A. et al.,
2003, AJ,126, 2037 
(Table 3).  UBVRI standard star magnitudes were taken from Henden, A.
2002, GCN 1571.  

Due to poor seeing at USNO and the close proximity of the galaxy
complexes, a subtraction routine was performed with limited success on
the galaxies labeled G2 + G3 in Soderberg, A. M. et al., 2004, ApJ,
606, 994 (Figure 1) to determine the magnitude of the OT.  Within the
errors, the magnitude of the OT does not change between one and two
months post-burst and is thus taken as the magnitude of the G1 complex
(Soderberg et al. 2004).  

The CTIO images yield average magnitudes of  g' = 21.30 +/- 0.07 mag
and 
r' = 20.18 +/- 0.14 mag.  The USNO images yield average magnitudes of
R ~ 21 mag
and I ~ 20.4 mag.  These results are very consistent with prior
authors regarding the 
underlying host galaxy; however, the subtraction routine may be a
source of systematic error.
