report:

Spectra of the GRB 021004 afterglow were obtained with the
Magellan 6.5m Baade Telescope on Oct. 5.0 UT and with the
MMT on Oct. 5.1, 5.3 and 6.3 UT. The spectra confirm two major MgII
absorption systems at z=1.38 and z=1.60 (GCN 1569, 1579, 1582). The moderate
resolution Magellan spectra show that the strong, unidentified line
at 515 nm is made of 3 components separated by 0.9 nm. The MMT spectra
extended to 330 nm and show no Lyman forest break implying a
limit to the redshift of z<1.7. 

The CIV absorption in the z=1.60 system is very strong with an
equivalent width of 0.5 nm (rest frame). There is another strong
line 2000 km/s to the blue of the CIV which may be  a second CIV
component. In addition, an emission line is detected at 405.2 nm forming
a P-Cygni profile with the CIV absorption. We conclude that the host
is a starburst galaxy.

GRB021004: not fading anymore?

K. Z. Stanek, D. Bersier, J. Winn (Harvard-Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics), P. Garnavich (Notre Dame) report:

R-band images of the afterglow associated with GRB 021004 (GCN 1564)
were obtained with the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope on
Oct. 7 between 02:43 and 11:09 UT. The afterglow seems to have stopped
fading.  We give below our last measurement from the night of Oct. 6
and our last measurement on Oct. 7

-----------------------------
Oct 6  11:25 UT  20.08   0.05
Oct 7  11:09 UT  20.09   0.06

This could be due to the presence of a bright host galaxy, but PSF
fitting shows no residual as would be expected from an extended
source.  Furthermore, such a bright host galaxy would be in conflict
with the upper limits of Wood-Vasey et al. (GCN 1572).

     We have obtained deep Rc-band images of the field containing
GRB 021004 using the 2.56-meter Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma
on the evening of Oct. 6 UT.  The optical afterglow of GRB 021004
is visible in our images.  Using the comparison star from
Fox et al. (2002, GCN 1564) and the calibration of
Henden (2002, GNC 1583) we find the following preliminary magnitudes:

     These magnitudes, and those of Holland et al. (2002, GCN 2002),
imply that the optical afterglow faded at a rate a rate of alpha =
-0.9 between 32 and 58 hours after the burst.  We note that that the
optical afterglow appears to be fading less slowly than it did between
12 and 17 hours after the burst.  A deep Rc image constructed from all
of our data shows no evidence for a host galaxy.  A plot of our
preliminary Rc-band light curve is available at

"We have performed polarimetric observations of the afterglow of
GRB 021004 (Fox, GCN 1564; Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565) with the FORS1
instrument at the VLT. The observations were done between October 5.15
and October 5.20 UT in the V-band.
   Independently of Covino et al. (GCN 1595), we find a polarization value
for the OT of P = (1.32 +/- 0.28) %, with a position angle of theta =
(125 +/- 1) degrees.
   Correcting for possible polarization due to the interstellar medium is
rather difficult, since there are few bright stars close to the OT position.
Using 12 bright stars within 4.5 arcmin from this position, we find a mean
ISM polarization of P = (0.7 +/- 0.3) % and theta = (116 +/- 4) degrees.
The error in the degree of polarization is obtained from the spread in the
values found for the field stars.
   The resultant degree of polarization for the OT is P = (0.57 +/- 0.40) %.
Since this result could be entirely due to polarization induced by ISM,
we derive a 3-sigma upper limit of P = 1.2 % for the degree of
polarization.

We observed the optical counterpart to GRB 021004 (Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565; 
Fox, GCN 1564) on October 5.077 (13.75 hours after the GRB trigger). The 
observations were performed with the ESO VLT-UT3 (Melipal) telescope equipped 
with FORS1 and a Bessel V filter in the imaging polarimetry mode. The 
transient source is clearly detected in the acquisition image with a 
magnitude V = 19.34 +/- 0.02 with respect to the USNO star at 00:26:58.713 
+18:56:56.61(Fox, GCN 1564) as calibrated by Henden (GCN 1583).

The polarimetric observations were obtained from October 5.080 to 5.149 UT 
(from 13.82 to 15.48 hours after the burst). We found linear polarization at 
the level of P = (1.26 +/- 0.10)% with position angle (114.2 +/- 2.2) degrees 
(uncertanties are 1-sigma errors).

The polarization induced by the interstellar matter in our Galaxy was 
estimated by field stars and accounts to P = (0.61 +/- 0.04)% with position 
angle (114.4 +/- 1.7) degrees. Once we remove the effect of ISM the intrinsic 
polarization of the optical transient turns out to be P = (0.65 +/- 0.11)% 
and position angle (114.4 +/-  4.6) degrees. Given that the field stars show 
a rather wide distribution in polarization degree and that the position angle 
for the stars and the optical transient are essentially the same, we can not 
rule out the possibility that the measured polarization is entirely due to 
the ISM in the Galaxy. This, in addition, leaves little room for host galaxy 
ISM induced polarization, that could account for at most a small fraction of 
the observed polarization.

the R-band photometric reference USNO star RA=00:26:58.77,

Their typical errors (1 sigma) are 0.12 mag.

We find that our point 1 is fainter than the magnitude extrapolated back
from the observations at later epochs (decay index 1.32, Weidinger et al.
GCN 1573).  This suggests that the break occurred during our
observations between 0.08 d and 0.2 d after the burst.

the reference has star has R=15.52.  Previous R magnitudes reported
in GCN #1578 would have to be decreased by 0.12 to match this reference.
The mean R-band decay between 8 and 48 hours as determined by the NOT and
MDM measurements can be described as a power law of slope -1.05, but with
highly significant deviations from a power law (Winn et al., GCN #1576)

 In response to the GCN/HETE burst position notice, a part of the
error region of GRB 021004 (Shirasaki, et al., GCN 1565) was observed
by the automated system at RIKEN. Starting at 12:09:27 UT (193-s after

reflector equipped with unfiltered CCD AP7p.

 Frequent passages of clouds significantly degraded the limiting
magnitudes of the data. The optical afterglow reported by Fox (GCN
1564) is not visible in our early phase images. Comparison with the

     These magnitudes imply that the optical afterglow faded at a rate
of alpha = -1.08 during the four hours that these observations were
taken.  Combining these magnitudes with those of Weidinger et al.
(2002, GCN 1573) suggests that the optical afterglow has decayed with
a constant slope of alpha = -1.01 between 0.09 and 1.50 days after the
burst.  A plot of our preliminary Rc-band light curve is available at

R. J. Cool, J. J. Schaefer (University of Wyoming) reporting on behalf of 
the University of Wyoming GRB Response Team under the direction of R. 
Canterna:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 021004 (GCN #1564) with the 
Red Buttes Observatory 0.6 meter telescope, operated through the 
University of Wyoming, between 4:37 UT and 6:25 UT on October 5 2002.  
All observations were completed in the R-band under unfavorable
conditions. 

We find R-band magnitudes for two epochs:

     ====================== 
     04:52:36   19.14
     06:20:25   19.23

Typical errors on these values are +/- 0.1 mag.  Calibration was completed 
assuming the USNO star from Weidinger (GCN #1573) has an R magnitude of 
15.64.  Further analysis and observations are scheduled in the coming 
days.

DATE:    02/10/05 18:20:08 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
an 11x11 arcmin field centered at the afterglow coordinates
for GRB021004 (Shirasaki et al. GCN 1565; Fox et al. GCN 1564)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one photometric night.  Stars
brighter than V=14.0 are saturated and should be used with care.
We have placed the photometric data on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb021004.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.

The coordinates of the afterglow, based on UCAC2, are:
  00:26:54.68  +18:55:41.6  J2000
The error in RA is about 0.05arcsec; the error in Dec
is about 0.2arcsec.  These coordinates will be improved,
but are in good agreement with Fox et al.
The object is nor particularly red or blue,
so a typical field star should work for a comparison.

While the night was photometric, the GRB field was observed
at high airmass due to other programs on the 1.0m telescope.
We estimate the present zeropoint errors to be about 0.03mag.
We will be extending this calibration with additional nights to
ensure against a systematic zeropoint error, and to include
U-band measures.  You should check the dates on
the .dat file prior to final publication to get the latest photometry.

In particular, the comparison star used by Fox et al.
has the following position and magnitudes:

    RA (J2000) DEC           V     B-V    V-R   R-I
00:26:58.77  +18:56:56.1  16.261  1.204  0.737  0.664

These values yield Rc=15.52, somewhat fainter than the
assumed magnitude in Fox.

Calibration of the GRB021004 field will continue around October 9 UT.

Mike Eracleous (Penn State), Bradley E. Schaefer (U. Texas), Jeff Mader
(McDonald Obs.), and Craig Wheeler (U. Texas) report on behalf of the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope GRB followup team:

"We have obtained spectra of the optical counterpart of GRB021004 (GCN
1564) with the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly telescope.  The observations
consisted of a series of three 15-minute exposures starting at
2002-Oct-5 3:34UT and a series of three 15-minute exposures starting
at 2002-Oct-5 8:24UT with the Marcario Low-Resolution Spectrograph.
The spectra cover the range 4200 - 9200 Angstrom at a spectral
resolution of approximately 15 Angstrom.  We detect the Mg II
absorption lines reported by Fox et al.  (GCN 1569) and confirm the
presence of two absorption systems at z=1.38 and z=1.60.  We do not
detect any significant absorption corresponding to the Mg I line at a
rest wavelength of 2853 Angstrom (with z=1.60) as reported by Fox et
al.  (GCN 1569).  We do not find any lines suggestive of absorption
systems at higher redshifts.  We also detect the Fe II UV1, UV2, and
UV3 absorption multiplets associated with both redshift systems (the
Fe II lines associated with the z=1.60 have already been reported by
Fox et al.).  In addition we also find four prominent absorption lines
at observed wavelengths of 4633, 4664, 5109, and 5152 Angstrom, which
we have not yet been able to identify.  The ratio of wavelengths
between these pair of lines approximately equals (1+1.38)/(1+1.60),
which suggests that these lines are from the same features with rest
wavelengths of 1947 and 1960 Angstroms.  The continuum shape can be
described by a power law of the form f_nu ~ nu^{-p}.  After correcting
for Galactic extinction we tentatively estimate a power-law index of 
p ~ 1.5."

These measurements are consistent with and extend the steepening light
curve that they saw.  The combined NOT and MDM points indicate a decay
slope alpha = 1.16 +/- 0.07, but there are possible fluctuations of the
type referred to by Winn et al. (GCN #1576) in our data that are
contemporaneous with theirs.

report:

Images of the afterglow associated with GRB 021004 (GCN 1564)
were obtained with the CTIO 4m + Mosaic Camera and
the Fred Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope beginning
at Oct. 5.15 (UT). Preliminary analysis of the

These data indicate that the rapid decay (GCN 1573)
has slowed considerably. The power-law index of
the optical light between 15 and 22 hours after the
burst is only 0.37. This behavior is similar
to the bump seen in GRB 000103c which may have been
due to a microlensing event (Garnavich, Loeb & Stanek
2000, ApJ, 554, 11). Monitoring this object at a
moderate time resolution is urged.

Analysis of the full data set derived from the HETE Soft X-ray Camera 
(SXC) has resulted in a revised location for GRB021004(=H2380; 
Shirasaki et al, GCN Circular #1565). The revised SXC location can be 
expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 62 arcsec in radius and 
is centered at:

RA = 00h 26m 55.7s, Dec = +18d 56' 18.6" (J2000)

This revised SXC localization is shifted 38 arcsec with respect to, 
but lies fully within, the original 120 arcsec radius SXC error 
circle reported by Shirasaki et al in GCN1565. The fading optical 
transient reported by Fox in GCN1564 is 40 arcsec from the center of, 
and is within, this revised SXC error circle.

report on behalf of VSNET-GRB collaboration:

  We are observing the WXM error box of GRB 021004 (GCN 1565) from
Oct. 4 12:41 UT with 0.30-m telescope (+unfiltered CCD) at Kyoto
University.  First 30sec * 52 exposure were obtained until 13:16 UT.
An inspection of a integrated image reveal the optical afterglow
candidate (Fox et al., GCN 1564) at R mag about 16.3, which confirms 
further rapid decline of this object.  The observation and analysis
are in progress.

At 12:06:13.57 UTC (43573.57 s UT) on 4 Oct 2002, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2380, a long GRB.  The WXM
flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN Position
Notice at 12:07:02 UT, 49 sec after the beginning of the burst.

Ground analysis of the WXM data for the burst produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice at 13:19:54 UT,
73 minutes after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 14.  The WXM
location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 10
arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 47s, Dec = +18d 59' 13" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a further
refinement in the location, which was reported in a GCN Position Notice
at 14:39:51 UT, 154 minutes after the burst.  The SXC localization SNR
was 9.  The SXC location can be expressed as a 90% confidence circle
that is 2 arcminutes in radius and is centered at

RA = 00h 26m 57s, Dec = +18d 55' 44" (J2000).

The SXC localization may be improved.

In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, the burst had a duration of ~100 seconds.
In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the burst also had a duration of ~100
seconds.

FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

D.W. Fox reports on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO GRB Collaboration:  

"We have observed the error box of GRB021004 (HETE Trigger 2380;
trigger time 12:06:13.57 UT) with the 48-inch Oschin/NEAT robotic
telescope at Palomar Observatory, with three 60-second integrations
beginning at 12:15:11, 12:17:45, and 12:22:52 UT.  We identify a new,
stationary, fading, point-like object by comparison with the Digitized
Sky Survey.  The object coordinates are:

    RA 00:26:54.689, Dec +18:55:41.3   (J2000)

with an uncertainty of less than 0.5" in each coordinate.  Deriving an
R-band photometric zero-point for our unfiltered observations by
reference to the USNO star at 00:26:58.713 +18:56:56.61, which we
assume to have magnitude R=15.3, we find object magnitudes at our
three mean epochs of:

         Mean Epoch  
       UT      From GRB   Magnitude
  ========================================
    12:15:41 UT   567 s   15.34 mag
    12:18:15      721     15.49
    12:23:22     1028     15.78
  ========================================

Given the source brightness and fading behavior we identify the object
as the likely optical afterglow of GRB021004.  A finding chart from
these observations may be found at
