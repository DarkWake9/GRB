"We have acquired BVRcIc photometry of the field of GRB020405 with the
Danish 1.54m and NTT 3.58m ESO telescopes at La Silla, Chile. 

We placed the photometric data of 6 selected stars, together with an
R-band image of the field on which the stars are marked, at the URL: 

http://tonno.tesre.bo.cnr.it/~masetti/grb020405_phot.html 

The current photometry has a potential external zero-point error of about
three percent that needs to be added in quadrature to the Poisson errors
given for the magnitude uncertainties of the selected stars.

Specifically, the magnitudes of the USNO-A2.0 stars 0525-16813005 and
0525-16815468 (Palazzi et al., GCN #1328; Hjorth et al., GCN # 1329),
which are labeled as stars # 2 and # 5 of our sample, are 
V = 19.01 +- 0.01, R = 18.48 +- 0.01 for the first one and

Collaboration, report: 

"We have obtained an R-band image (2 x 3 minutes integration) of GRB020405
from VLT-UT3 (Melipal) plus FORS1 on 2002 Apr. 15.244 under a seeing of 
0.65 arcsec.

We find that the OT is located within a complex environment composed of 
at least four extended objects, one of which is underlying the OT and
showing a bright knot (possibly a star-forming region, or alternatively 
the host nucleus) ~1 arcsec south of the OT itself.

Also, the presumed host galaxy indicated by Hjorth et al. (GCN #1329)
and located ~2 arcsec southwest of the OT seems not to be the actual host
but a galaxy which is likely interacting with it.
Indeed, a spectrum of this galaxy taken with Melipal+FORS1 on 
2002 April 7.310 shows that it is at the same redshift of the OT
(GCNs #1330, #1340).

This finding strengthens the suggestion that GRBs are sometimes associated
with interacting galaxies possibly displaying substantial star formation,
as seen e.g. for GRB001007 (Castro Ceron et al. 2002, A&A, in press
[astro-ph/0110049]).

No suggestion of a break in the light curve (see GCN #1369) is apparent 
up to ~10 days after the GRB.
However, in the VLT image reported above, the OT brightness is already
substantially contamined by the host emission. For this reason it would
be quite difficult to see any future possible break in the OT light
curve with ground-based observations.

D. Malesani, G. Ghisellini, S. Covino (Brera Observ., Milan) and
D. Lazzati (IoA Cambridge, UK) report:

According to the idea of Frail et al. (2001, ApJ, 562, L55) that the jet

energies of GRBs are universal, an achromatic jet break in the afterglow

lightcurve is predicted for all bursts at the time

t_jet = 20.4 (1+z) / (E_gamma/1e52) days,

where E_gamma is the observed (i.e. isotropic) energy of the prompt
emission. This result is independent of the unknown efficiency and
circumburst density.

For GRB020405, with z=0.69 (GCN 1330 and GCN 1340) and E_gamma>4.3e52
erg (assuming H_0=65, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7 and taking the
fluence to be larger than the reported value in the 25-100 keV band:
3e-5 erg/cm2, GCN 1325), we have t_jet<8 days. Hence the break
should have occured before April 13.

Our V-band data (GCN 1337, 1345) connect very well with a previous
measurement by Palazzi et al. (GCN 1328), who use the same calibration
stars. The decay slope is hence very well defined (1.52+-0.04), making
easier the possible detection of the predicted break (see the lightcurve

at:  http://www.merate.mi.astro.it/~gabriele/020405.html ).
Since both the detection or the non-detection of the break would be very

important to constrain Frail et al. idea, we urge photometric
observations of the afterglow of this burst.

respectively, as reported in  Palazzi et al. (GCN 1328).

Relative photometry between our V band observations of April 7.143 
and 8.164 shows that the OT decayed by 0.60 +- 0.05 magnitudes, implying
a decay slope of 1.52 +- 0.12, also consistent with

We have observed the afterglow of GRB 020405 (GCN #1326) with the
Keck II telescope + ESI.  Observations consisted of 2x1800 sec exposures
in the eschellete mode.  In this mode we are able to resolve the sky
lines, which is particularly important since at the reported redshift
of z = 0.695 (Masetti et al., GCN #1330) the [O II] line is coincident
with a strong atmospheric line.  A preliminary reduction of the spectra
reveals emission lines of [O II], Hbeta, and [O III], at a mean redshift
of z = 0.6898 +/- 0.0005.  In particular, we resolve the [O II] doublet
and thus we consider the redshift to be secure.

Revised Photometry of the Optical Afterglow of GRB 020405


J. Hjorth (U. Copenhagen) reports:

The calibration of the PSF photometry reported in GCN #1329 relied on a
misidentification of the USNO A2.0 star 0525_16813005 with 0525_16812476.
Calibration to 0525_16813005 yields R = 19.8 and B - R = 1.0 at April 6.21 UT,
consistent with the reports of Palazzi et al. (GCN #1328), Price et al.
(GCN #1333), and Gal-Yam et al. (GCN #1335). The systematic error in these
values is of the order of +- 0.3 mag. I apologize for the impact this error
may have had on follow-up strategies and thank Javier Gorosabel and Paul Price
for pointing out the problem.

Additional data taken with the DK1.5m between Apr 7.13 and Apr 7.37 confirm
the continued fading of the source. A careful analysis of these data is in
progress!

We have re-observed the afterglow candidate (GCN #1326) with the

The afterglow candidate has faded by approximately 1 magnitude
since the observations of Apr 5.75 (GCN #1326), from which we
derive an optical decay index of alpha ~ 1.26.  Using the reference
star of Hjorth et al. (GCN #1329), we find that R ~ 19.9 mag at
Apr 6.43.  This value does not appear to be consistent with that of
Hjorth et al., which might be explained by the filter mis-match
and use of different apertures.

A. Delsanti (ESO), B. L. Jensen (U. Copenhagen), J. Gorosabel (IAA, Granada), 
H. Pedersen (U. Copenhagen), and M. I. Andersen (U. Oulu) report:

Optical images of the candidate afterglow (Price et al., GCN #1326) of 
GRB 020405 (Hurley et al., GCN #1325) were obtained at the Danish 1.5-m 
telescope on La Silla as follows:

    Date          Filter    Exp. time   
6 April 2002 UT               (sec)

    03:16           R          600

    05:56         Gunn i       900

Calibrating our photometry to the reference star USNO525_16813005 (for
which we assume B = 19.3 and R = 17.8) we find R = 20.9 and B - R = 0.0.
In addition, comparison between the two R-band images indicates that the 
afterglow faded with 0.099 +- 0.040 mag between the two epochs, thus 
supporting the interpretation that the source is indeed the afterglow of 
GRB 020405.

A color image (based on the BVi images) posted at 

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jens/grb020405_color.gif

shows the very blue color of the afterglow (see also Castro-Tirado et al., 
GCN #1327). 

In addition, the R-band images posted at

http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jens/grb020405_host1.gif
http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jens/grb020405_host2.gif

reveal a bright galaxy located ~ 2" to the south-west of the afterglow.
If this is the host galaxy, then the redshift of GRB 020405 may be fairly 
low, making it a good candidate for a search of an underlying supernova.
