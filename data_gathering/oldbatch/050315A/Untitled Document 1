on behalf of the Swift-BAT team: 

Analysis of the available data for the Swift-BAT GRB050315 
(Parsons et al., GCN Circ 3094) yields a fluence of > 2.8x10^-6 
erg/cm2 in the 15-350 keV band and a peak flux of 2.5 ph/cm2/sec 
(also 15-350 keV).  The photon index of the 1-s peak spectrum (T0+25 sec.) 
is 2.5 +- 0.3 (90% confidence).  Although there is a data gap, 
the time averaged spectrum also shows a soft spectrum.  
This appears to be a soft X-ray-rich GRB.  

We are planning a further circular when more complete data 
are avaliable.

Mark H Wieringa (Australia Telescope National Facility), Brian P Schmidt 
(Australian National University)
and Alicia Soderberg (CalTech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed a region covering the Swift burst GRB 050315 (GCN#3094)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array for 1 hour centered on
March 16.02 UT. At frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6 GHz no emission was
detected within the 6 arcsec diameter error circle of the XRT position
(GCN#3097). The 3-sigma detection limits are 0.6 and 0.8 mJy at 4.8 and
8.6 GHz respectively. No detections above these limits are present
in a larger area (1 arcmin diameter) around the XRT position."

 We thank the ATNF Director for making this rapid response possible.

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050315 at 20:59:42 UT on 15 March 
2005 (Parsons et al 2005, GCN 3094).  The observatory executed an automated 
slew to the BAT position and the XRT began taking data at 21:01:05.5 
UT.  The XRT was in Manual state and made observations in Photon Counting 
mode.  Data were dumped to the ground at about 00:00 UT on 16 March 2005 
and a preliminary analysis was performed by the XRT team.  We find a bright 
uncataloged, rapidly fading X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 20:25:54,
Dec(J2000) = -42:36:0.2

We estimate an uncertainty of about 6 arcseconds.   This source is 32 
arcseconds from the BAT position reported in GCN 3094.

behalf of the Swift UVOT team.

     The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observing
the field of GRB 050315 (GCN 3094) at 21:01:13 UT, approximately 90
seconds after the BAT trigger.  The first image was sent down via the
TDRSS link approximately 200 seconds after the trigger.  This image
was a 100 second exposure taken with the V filter.  It was centred on
the BAT position, and had a size of 5 x 5 arcminutes, which covered
88% of the BAT error circle.  The middle of the exposure was 140.19
seconds after the BAT trigger.  The image was binned 8 x 8 to reduce
the bandwidth required for transmission.  A comparison against the DSS
showed no new sources down to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of
approximately V = 18.5.  We stress that this limiting magnitude is
based on ground calibrations and may be uncertain by approximately 0.5
mag.  The full-resolution version of this image will be transmitted to
the ground during the next Malindi pass, which will occur at
approximately 0000 UTC March 16, 2005.

on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

At 20:59:42 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB 050315.  The spacecraft automatically slewed
to the burst location, and UVOT began automated observations.  XRT was
not in a mode suitable for immediate position determination.

Using the time interval of the trigger of the burst, the 
ground-calculated
location is RA,Dec 306.476,-42.591 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 
arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 40 degrees off the BAT boresight (60% coding).

The burst lightcurve has 2 overlapping FRED-like peaks.  The duration
is ~40 sec.  There is no further emmission out to T+180 sec, where the 
end
of the real-time TDRSS data ends.  The peak count rate is ~2500 
counts/sec.
