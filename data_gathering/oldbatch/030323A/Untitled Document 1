G. Masi (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and European Southern Observatory,

(Astronomical Observatory, Copenhagen) report: 


Further to GCN 1960, we performed additional photometry of the OT initially 
reported by Gilmore at al. (GCN 1949). The Danish 1.54m telescope (La Silla) 
+ DFOSC CCD camera were used to grab three, 360s R-band images; summing them 
we obtained the following Rc magnitudes (based on GCN 1948): 

Mar. 26, 00:54 UT   21.3 Rc
Mar. 27, 00:50 UT   21.6 Rc
Mar. 28, 03:45 UT   22.8 Rc

V. Beckmann and S.E. Shaw on behalf of the INTEGRAL Science Data Center,
J.-P. Roques on behalf of the SPI instrument team, Sergei Molkov (IKI),
and the INTEGRAL Science Working team report the detection of a possible
GRB at 08:42:24 UTC on March 23, 2003.

The burst lasted about 5 seconds.

The preliminary position is RA 19h 49m, DEC -12deg 30' (J2000)
with an uncertainty of 2 degrees radius. The preliminary peak flux over
2 seconds is about 2 * 10^-7 ergs/cm**2/sec between 25 and 100 keV.

The burst has been detected by SPI at large off-axis angle (14.5
degrees), outside the field of view of IBIS.

We have observed the optical afterglow of GRB030323,
originally reported by Henden et al. GCN 1949, with the
SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO. We obtained 29, 300s
exposures in the Johnson R band filter.  Observations
began at 03:32:56UT, and ended at 07:22:56UT, on March
25th.  The obsevations were carried out under good seeing
conditions.  Aperture photometry was performed, and
calibrated utilizing standards reported by Henden et al.,
GCN 1948.

We find a mean R magnitude of 20.6 +- 0.1.

G. Masi (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and European Southern Observatory,

(Astronomical Observatory, Copenhagen) report: 

We imaged the field around the afterglow candidate reported by Gilmore at 
al. for GRB030323 (GCN 1949) with the Danish 1.54m telescope (La Silla) + 
DFOSC CCD camera. Observations started around March 25.0, 2003 UT. We 
located the source at the following position (J2000.0): 

RA: 11h06m09.40s; Decl.: -21d46'13.2" 

(mean residuals: 0.15"; catalogue: USNO-SA2.0) 

in excellent agreement with the astrometry provided in the GCN cited above. 

We performed time-resolved, R-band photometry, assuming for the reference 
stars the magnitudes provided by Henden et al. (GCN 1948). Results follow: 

25 Mar. 0:01    20.38 Rc

The candidate showed just a modest fading during the run. 

In addition, we provide V and Ic magnitudes, again based on GCN 1948:

At 21:56:57.60 UTC (79017.60 s UT) on 23 Mar 2003, the HETE FREGATE,
WXM, and SXC instruments detected event H2460, a faint, long GRB.

Ground analysis of the WXM data produced a localization which was
reported in a GCN Notice at 02:55:11 UT on 24 Mar, about 5 hours after
the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 6.  The WXM localization can
be expressed as a 90% confidence circle that is 18 arcminutes in radius
and is centered at

WXM:   RA = +11h 06m 54s, Dec = -21d 51' 00" (J2000).

Ground analysis of the SXC data for the burst produced a more accurate
location which was reported in a GCN Notice at 05:28:51 UT on 24 Mar,
about 7 1/2 hours after the burst.  The SXC localization can be
expressed as a 90% confidence trapezoid, whose base and top are 24.5
and 11 arcminutes, whose height is 4 arcminutes, and whose area is 71
square arcminutes.  The center of the trapezoid lies at

RA = +11h 06m 06s, Dec = -21d 54' 20"  (J2000),

and its corners lie at

RA = +11h 05m 59.0s, Dec = -21d 48' 43"
RA = +11h 05m 56.6s, Dec = -21d 59' 46"
RA = +11h 06m 12.5s, Dec = -22d 06' 43"
RA = +11h 06m 17.8s, Dec = -21d 42" 11"  (J2000).

The SXC localization is trapezoidal because its sides are defined by
the WXM error circle.

The t_90 duration of the burst in the 30-400 keV band was 26 s. The
fluence of the burst was 1.1 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and the peak flux in 1.2
sec was ~1.2 x 10-9 ergs cm-2 s-1 (i.e., ~ 0.05 x Crab flux) in the
same energy band.

At 03:12:42.80 UTC (11562.80 s UT) on 24 Mar 2003, the HETE FREGATE

The WXM flight localization was correct and was reported in a GCN
Notice at 03:13:07 UTC, 25 sec after the beginning of the burst 

Ground analysis of the WXM WXM data for the burst produced a refined
location, which was reported in a GCN Notice at 04:23:48 UT, 71 minutes
after the burst.  The WXM localization SNR was 16.  The WXM location

radius and is centered at

WXM:   RA = +13h 37m 11s, Dec = -00d 19' 22" (J2000).

The SXC turns off at orbit dawn; this happened 10 sec before the
beginning of the burst, and therefore there will be no SXC localization
for this burst.

The burst duration t_90 in the 30-400 keV band was ~ 8.7 s.  The
fluence of the burst was 1.6 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 and the peak flux over 5

FROM:    Paul Vreeswijk at ESO  <pvreeswi@eso.org>

Paul Vreeswijk (ESO), Ralph Wijers, Evert Rol (U. of Amsterdam), and
Jens Hjorth (U. of Copenhagen) report for the GRACE collaboration:

The field of GRB 030323 (HETE trigger 2640) was observed last night
(March 24/25) in spectroscopic mode with FORS2 at unit-4 of ESO's VLT
at Paranal, Chile. The total exposure time was 1 hour in the 300V and
300I grisms, covering approximately 4000-9300 A with a resolution of
about 12 A. The slit (1" wide) was positioned to cover the position of
the presumed afterglow (Gilmore, Kilmartin & Henden, GCN 1949; see
also GCN 1952), as well as a nearby reference object.

Preliminary reduction of the 300V spectra of the candidate afterglow
shows very strong absorption over the range 516-545 nm, presumably a
complex of Ly alpha clouds around z = 3.3-3.4. The detection of
numerous narrow lines is consistent with this interpretation: we can
identify these with metal-absorption lines (SiII, OI, CII, SiIV, CIV,
AlII) at a redshift of z = 3.372. These Ly alpha and metal-absorption
lines probably originate in the host galaxy of GRB 030323.

We appreciate the assistance of the ESO staff at Paranal; in
particular of Thomas Szeifert and Olivier Marco.

We have observed the full error box of GRB 030323 (HETE trigger 2640) using the
ROTSE-3B 0.45 meter telescope at McDonald Observatory, Texas, starting March
24, 5:47 UT (7.8 hours after the burst).  Ninety one-minute unfiltered
exposures were taken, yielding limiting magnitudes between 17.5 and 18.5,
calibrated against USNO A2.0 R-band.  A source is marginally detected in seven
of these images at the location of the optical counterpart candidate reported
by Gilmore et al.  (GCN Circ. 1949).  We co-added four consecutive sets of
twenty images, and the counterpart candidate is clearly detected in the first
co-added image at a magnitude of 18.4+-0.1 at 5:59 hours UT (limiting magnitude
for this co-added image is estimated at 19.5).  Visual inspection of the other
three co-added images indicate that the source is present near the limiting
magnitude in each frame, and we will continue analysis to derive a light curve.

not appear on any of the ESO/AAO red plates.  Its position,
along with two preliminary comparison stars (photometry

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired BVRcIc all-sky photometry for
a 20x20 arcmin field centered at the coordinates
for the HETE burst GRB030323 (HETE trigger 2640)
with the USNOFS 1.0-m telescope on one very marginal
photometric night.  Stars brighter than V=13.5 are saturated and
should be used with care.  We have placed the photometric data
on our anonymous ftp site:
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb030323.dat
The astrometry in this file is based on linear plate solutions
with respect to UCAC2.  The external errors are less than 100mas.
There were approaching clouds from a weak frontal system
that do not appear to have reached this field until well
after the observations, but until further calibration
is performed, a systematic error is possible.  Based purely
on the standard star observations, the estimated external
photometric error is 0.03mag.

If an OT is discovered, this calibration will be extended
with additional nights.  We will not be performing U-band
calibration unless requested.  As always, you should check
the dates on the .dat file prior to final publication to get
the latest photometry.
