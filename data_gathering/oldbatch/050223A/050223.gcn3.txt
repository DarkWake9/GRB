The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050223 at 03:09:06 UT on 23 Feb 
2005.  The GRB was located within the Earth angle constraint of the Narrow 
Field Instruments and the observatory was not able to slew to it at that 
time.  Swift executed an automated slew to the BAT position at 03:44 UT 
while the observatory was in the SAA.  The XRT began taking data at about 
03:57 UT after exiting the SAA.  The XRT was in Manual state and made 
observations in PCmode.  We find an uncataloged X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 18h 05m 32.6s,
Dec(J2000) = -62d 28' 19.7"

We estimate an uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds.  This position was 
generated using PSU processing software on 400 s of data.  Once data become 
available at the SDC a more accurate refined position will be determined.

This position is within 1.6 arcminutes of the BAT position.

At 03:09:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050223.  Because of the Earth-limb constraint,
the spacecraft could not immediately slew to the burst location.
The location became unconstrained at T+35 min, and the spacecraft slewed.
The XRT and UVOT instruments then began their standard set of pre-programmed
observing sequences.

Using the time interval of the burst, the ground-calculated location
is RA, Dec 271.390, -62.481 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 36 degrees off the BAT boresight (70% encoding).

The burst lightcurve has several small, short peaks on top of a slow rise 
and fall with a T90 duration of ~23 sec (and T50 is 10 sec). The 
peak flux is 0.8 ph/cm2/sec for a 1-sec interval (15-350 keV).  Using 
a simple power law model, the fluence is 7.4 e-7 erg/cm^2 (15-350 keV).

Title: GRB050223: ROTSE-III Optical Observations

Smith, D. A. (U. of Michigan) reports on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia responded to
Swift GRB 050223 (Trigger #106709).  An automatic response resulted in a series
of 97 images beginning 7.7 seconds after receipt of the GCN trigger under fair
conditions.  Some light clouds drifted through the field, but the images
calibrated successfully.  The first image began at 23 Feb 2005 03:10:07.74,
61.6 seconds after the burst.  We took 10 5-second, 10 20-second and 67 60-s
exposures.  The images are unfiltered and were calibrated relative to USNO
A2.0. At 18.8 degrees galactic latitude, the source is in a crowded field, and
our limits are adversely effected by source confusion.

Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.4-17.1 (for longer
exposures).  Comparison to DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma BAT error circle to a limiting magnitude of 18.0 for co-adds of 10
images taken up to 43 minutes after the burst.  In particular, no new source is
found at the location of the XRT source coordinates (Giommi et al., GCN
Circ. No. 3054).

Swift Bat trigger (Mitani et al, GCN 3055). The delay in observations was 
due to the Earth-limb constaint, which prevented an immediate slew. We

(Giommi et al, GCN 3054).

GRB 050223, discovered by Swift (Giommi et al. GCN 3054, Mitani et al.

INTEGRAL.

The burst occurred during a 200 sec long time interval in which the
automatic distribution of IBAS Alerts was disabled due to the temporary
switch-off of one of the 8 modules of the IBIS/ISGRI detector.

The GRB coordinates (J2000) derived from an off-line analysis are:

RA:   271.4002 [degrees]
DEC:  -62.4739 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

The peak flux measured with IBIS/ISGRI is 0.6 ph/cmsq/s (20-200 keV, 1 s

A. De Luca (IASF-Mi), S. Campana (OAB) on behalf of a larger
collaboration report:

We have analyzed the data from the XMM-Newton observation of
GRB050223, discovered by Swift on 2005, Feb 23, 03:09:06 UTC
(Giommi et al., GCN3054).

The XMM-Newton observation started on 2005, Feb. 23 at 13:04 UT
and ended on 2005, Feb 24 at 06:14:20, with a gap between
Feb. 23 16:54 UT and Feb. 23 18:56 UT  due to a ground station
outage. A first account of results, based on the analysis of
preliminary data, have been presented by the XMM-Newton SOC team
(http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb050223/index.shtml).

Observation Data Files have been produced and released only for
the part of the observation starting from Feb. 23 18:55:57 UT
(after the gap) and lasting for 41 ks.

The whole observation is badly affected by low-energy particle
background, dramatically reducing the signal to noise, especially
in the data from the back-illuminated pn detector, which is
particularly sensitive to such background component.
This hampers a detailed study of the spectral and temporal
phenomenology of the faint source XMMU J180532.5-622821
(Gonzalez-Riestra et al., GCN 3060), the likely afterglow
of GRB050223.

As a first step, we improved the astrometry of the XMM-Newton/EPIC
images by matching X-ray sources in the field to bright stars in
the USNO-B1 catalogue.
The refined position (J2000) for the X-ray afterglow is

RA: 18h 05m 32.49s  Dec: -62d 28' 21.07"

The 1 sigma error radius is 1.5 arcsec (including the rms error on the
cross-correlation as well as systematic uncertainties in the optical
catalogue). The position is fully consistent with the XRT coordinates
(Giommi et al., GCN 3054) as well as with the preliminary XMM-Newton
position by Gonzalez-Riestra et al. (GCN 3060).

The EPIC light curve in the 0.5-2 keV range (where the signal-to-noise
is maximum) shows hints that the source is fading, following
a power law decay with index in the range 0.5-3 (90% confidence level).

We extracted time-averaged spectra from the three EPIC cameras and we
generated ad-hoc response and effective area files. A slightly absorbed
(NH<10^21 cm^-2, consistent with the Galactic column density in this
direction, 7x10^20  cm^-2) power law model with photon index
1.6(+0.6,-0.4) gives an acceptable description of the data in the 0.3-4
keV range, with a reduced chi2 of 1.5 (32 d.o.f). The quoted errors are
at 90% conf. level for a single interesting parameter.
The not optimal quality of the fit is most likely due to the heavy
background affecting the observation.
The observed flux (0.2-10 keV) is of ~3.7x10^-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1;
the corresponding unabsorbed flux is ~4x10^-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

R=21.6 mag (GCN 5268), corresponds to an absolute magnitude, M_B=-20.2 mag

a galaxy about 1.3 mag fainter located 10" to the east of the host galaxy,
indicating that it is a companion to the host with a separation of about
