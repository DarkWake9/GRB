D. W. Fox, R. Burruss, E. Berger, J. S. Bloom, S. G. Djorgovski, and
S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech), with M. Haynes (Cornell), report on behalf
of the larger Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"R. Burrus obtained Sloan r' images of the joint HETE/IPN localization
for GRB010921 (HETE trigger #1761; GCNs #1096 and #1097) with the Hale
200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory beginning 22 hours after the
trigger (22 September 03:18 UT).  The instrument used was the Large
Format Camera (LFC) and the observations were 4 min in duration (3
pointings). Visual comparison with the Digital Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey F plate reveals no obvious new source to the depth of the DPOSS
image (R ~ 20.5 mag)."

DATE:    01/09/22 03:00:24 GMT
FROM:    Derek Fox at CIT  <derekfox@astro.caltech.edu>

A. Mahabal, S. G. Djorgovski, and R. Brunner of the Caltech DPOSS
group, with D. W. Fox and P. A. Price of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB
collaboration, report:

"We have made Digital Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS) images of
the GRB 010921 error box (GCN #1097) publicly available through the
React Group webpages at:

    http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~react/GRB010921.html

The images may also be accessed directly as:   

    http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~react/fits/GRB010921j.fits
    http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~react/fits/GRB010921f.fits
    http://www.srl.caltech.edu/~react/fits/GRB010921n.fits

The images are 1801x1801 pixels, centered at (J2000) RA 22:55:34.86,
Dec +40:56:32.1, and covering 30'x30'.  The images are from the second
Palomar Sky Survey and were digitized at STScI; they have subsequently
been corrected for vignetting effects and have corrected astrometric
coefficients in the image headers.  Note that the image bandpasses are
green (j), red (f), and near-infrared (n), corresponding,
respectively, to the IIIa-J, IIIa-F, and IV-N emulsions used in the
survey.  Going forward, we hope to make DPOSS images of GRB fields in
the northern hemisphere available on a regular basis.

Please contact Ashish Mahabal <aam@astro.caltech.edu> or one of the
other authors of the Circular if you have any questions."

report:

Ulysses and BeppoSAX observed GRB010921 (=H1761, GCN 1096).  Triangulation
gives an annulus centered at RA(2000), Decl.(2000)=
232.299 deg., +67.605 deg., with radius 60.003 +/- 0.156 deg
(3 sigma).  This annulus intersects the HETE-II WXM error
box (GCN 1096) at

RA(2000)	Dec(2000)

343.596         +40.669
343.763         +41.069
344.027         +40.816 
344.195         +41.215

to form an error box whose area is approximately 250 sq. arcmin.
Some improvement to this error box is possible.
