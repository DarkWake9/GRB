The XMM-Newton Optical Monitor began observations of GRB050223
at 14:23:15 on 2005-02-23, about 11 hours after the initial
Swift BAT trigger (Mitani et al, GCN 3055). We detect no
source at the position of the XMM-Newton pn source
(Gonzalez-Riestra et al, GCN 3060). The estimated limiting
magnitudes (5-sigma) in each of the OM filters are as follows:

on behalf of the UNC team of the FUN GRB Collaboration:

We observed the 8 arcsecond position of the uncataloged x-ray source found
by the Swift XRT instrument (Giommi et al., GCN 3054) in the field of GRB
050223 with three telescopes of the PROMPT robotic telescope array located
at CTIO.  Manual observations first began in V 2.5 hours after the burst at
high airmass and no new sources were observed to the limiting magnitude of
a single exposure.  Observations continued in Rc and Ic and details are
given below.

S. Mereghetti, D. Gotz (IASF, Milano), N. Mowlavi, S. Shaw, M. Beck
(ISDC, Versoix) and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the IBAS
Localization Team report:


GRB 050223, discovered by Swift (Giommi et al. GCN 3054, Mitani et al.
GCN 3055), has been also detected by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board
INTEGRAL.

The burst occurred during a 200 sec long time interval in which the
automatic distribution of IBAS Alerts was disabled due to the temporary
switch-off of one of the 8 modules of the IBIS/ISGRI detector.

The GRB coordinates (J2000) derived from an off-line analysis are:

RA:   271.4002 [degrees]
DEC:  -62.4739 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (90% c.l. radius).

The peak flux measured with IBIS/ISGRI is 0.6 ph/cmsq/s (20-200 keV, 1 s
integration time).

The Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) began observations of 
GRB050223 at 03:55:28 UT on 23 Feb 2005, about 46:22 UT after the initial 
Swift Bat trigger (Mitani et al, GCN 3055). The delay in observations was 
due to the Earth-limb constaint, which prevented an immediate slew. We 
detect no source in the intial 100s exposure at the Swift XRT position 
(Giommi et al, GCN 3054).

Title: GRB050223: ROTSE-III Optical Observations

Smith, D. A. (U. of Michigan) reports on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia responded to
Swift GRB 050223 (Trigger #106709).  An automatic response resulted in a series
of 97 images beginning 7.7 seconds after receipt of the GCN trigger under fair
conditions.  Some light clouds drifted through the field, but the images
calibrated successfully.  The first image began at 23 Feb 2005 03:10:07.74,
61.6 seconds after the burst.  We took 10 5-second, 10 20-second and 67 60-s
exposures.  The images are unfiltered and were calibrated relative to USNO
A2.0. At 18.8 degrees galactic latitude, the source is in a crowded field, and
our limits are adversely effected by source confusion.

Individual images have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.4-17.1 (for longer
exposures).  Comparison to DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma BAT error circle to a limiting magnitude of 18.0 for co-adds of 10
images taken up to 43 minutes after the burst.  In particular, no new source is
found at the location of the XRT source coordinates (Giommi et al., GCN
Circ. No. 3054).

At 03:09:06 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located on-board GRB050223.  Because of the Earth-limb constraint,
the spacecraft could not immediately slew to the burst location.
The location became unconstrained at T+35 min, and the spacecraft slewed.
The XRT and UVOT instruments then began their standard set of pre-programmed
observing sequences.

Using the time interval of the burst, the ground-calculated location
is RA, Dec 271.390, -62.481 (J2000) with an uncertainty of 4 arcmin
(radius, including a systematic uncertainty, 90% containment).
The burst was 36 degrees off the BAT boresight (70% encoding).

The burst lightcurve has several small, short peaks on top of a slow rise 
and fall with a T90 duration of ~23 sec (and T50 is 10 sec). The 
peak flux is 0.8 ph/cm2/sec for a 1-sec interval (15-350 keV).  Using 
a simple power law model, the fluence is 7.4 e-7 erg/cm^2 (15-350 keV).

The Swift BAT instrument detected GRB 050223 at 03:09:06 UT on 23 Feb 
2005.  The GRB was located within the Earth angle constraint of the Narrow 
Field Instruments and the observatory was not able to slew to it at that 
time.  Swift executed an automated slew to the BAT position at 03:44 UT 
while the observatory was in the SAA.  The XRT began taking data at about 
03:57 UT after exiting the SAA.  The XRT was in Manual state and made 
observations in PCmode.  We find an uncataloged X-ray source located at:

RA(J2000) = 18h 05m 32.6s,
Dec(J2000) = -62d 28' 19.7"

We estimate an uncertainty of about 8 arcseconds.  This position was 
generated using PSU processing software on 400 s of data.  Once data become 
available at the SDC a more accurate refined position will be determined.

This position is within 1.6 arcminutes of the BAT position.
