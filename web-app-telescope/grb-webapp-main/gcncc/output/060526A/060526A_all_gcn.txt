report:

We observed the field around position of optical counterpart of
GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162; French &amp; Jelinek GCN 5165; Rykoff et
al. GCN 5166) with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150,
Bakirlitepe,TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). The observations were
made in Rc in two epochs: May 28, 20:07UT and May 29, 00:53UT (~51.64
and ~56.41 hours after the burst). The afterglow is detected clearly in
Rc bands in both epochs.

We estimate the following Rc magnitudes for the OT:

    t-t0  m_R     err
   51.64  21.464  0.04
   56.41  21.816  0.05

The last value indicates that the afterglow light curve had returned to
the extrapolated power-law decay with index -1.2 which was found between
5 and 16 hours of post-burst reported by Khamitov et al. (GCN 5173),
Halpern et al. (GCN 5176) and Cobb et al. (GCN 5180).

J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.), E. Armstrong (UCSD), &amp; N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) 
report on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We have continued to observe the afterglow of Swift GRB 060526 (Campana 
et al. GCN 5162) in the R-band for four consecutive nights using the
MDM 1.3m.  In combination with the GCN reported R-band photometry of 
Khamitov et al. (GCNs 5173,5177,5183,5186), it is evident that there have
been at least four flares, by which we mean alternating positive and
negative deviations from a mean decay rate.  These are characterized
as increases and decreases of at least 0.3 mag in as short a time as
delta t = 0.04*(t-t0), where t0 is the burst time.  In view of these
flares, it is problematic to fit a small number of power-law segments
(as noted by Kann &amp; Thoene GCN 5187).  Rather, we observe that the most 
recent point, r' = 22.87+/-0.07 on May 30 04:23 UT as calibrated with
Cool et al. (GCN 5164) data, falls only 0.25 mag below the -1.18 power
law originally fitted from 5.6 to 16 hours by Khamitov et al. (GCN 5173)
and Halpern et al. (GCN 5176).  Other details of the MDM optical light
curve and incorporated GCN data can be seen at:

http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jules/grb/060526/

This type of light curve is not uncommon in GRB afterglows (see, e.g.,
Stanek et al. astro-ph/0602495, and references therein), and is often
apparent when the source is well placed for long observing runs at
ground-based telescopes."

behalf of the Swift Team:

At 16:28:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 060526 (trigger=211957).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is RA,Dec 232.845, +0.244
{15h 31m 23s, +00d 14' 39"} (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin
(radius, 90% containment, including  systematic uncertainty). 
The BAT light curve shows multiple peaks starting at T-3 sec out to
T+15 sec.  The peak count rate was ~2600 counts/sec (15-350 keV),
at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 16:29:43 UT, 73 seconds after the
BAT trigger. XRT found an uncatalogued X-ray source  located at
RA(J2000) = 15h 31m 18.4s, Dec(J2000) = +00d 17' 11.0", with an
estimated uncertainty of 6.8 arcseconds (90% confidence radius). This
location is 166 arcseconds from the BAT on-board position, within the
BAT error circle. The initial flux in the 2.5s image was 3.6e-10
erg/cm2/s (0.2-10 keV). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 100 seconds with the White
(160-650 nm) filter starting 81 seconds after the BAT trigger. There
is a candidate afterglow in the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image
at (RA,DEC) (J2000) of (232.8265,0.2847) or
(15h31m18.36s,+00o17'04.9")  with a 1-sigma error radius of about 0.5
arc sec. This position is 6.2 arc sec. from the center of the XRT
error circle. The estimated magnitude is 17.6 with a 1-sigma error of
about 0.5 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction
corresponding to E(B-V) of  0.07.

D. A. Kann and U. Laux (Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg) report:

We observed the location of the afterglow of GRB 060526 (Campana et al., 
GCN 5162) with the Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope. Observing 
conditions were mediocre. While it was clear, transparency was low and sky 
background was high due to moonlight and light pollution.

We obtained 20 x 600 sec exposures for a total integration time of 12000 
seconds. Observations commenced on June 2, 21:04:17 UT and ended June 3, 
00:55:07 UT. Midexposure time is June 2.9546, which is 7.2682 days after 
the burst.

We do not detect the optical afterglow. Using the USNO calibration star 
from Khamitov et al., GCN 5177, we derive the following 2 sigma limiting 
magnitude:

t-t_0	Rc limit
7.2682	&gt; 23.5

As Khamitov et al. (GCN 5193) already found a similar magnitude of the 
afterglow two days earlier, this limit can only constrain that no further 
very bright flares have occured.

No further observations are planned.

B. E. Cobb (Yale), part of the larger SMARTS consortium, reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO, we
obtained optical/IR imaging of the error region of GRB 060526
(GCN 5162, Campana et al.) with a mid-exposure time of
2006-05-27 01:13 UT (~8.7 hours post-burst) and
again at 2006-05-27 04:07 UT (~11.6 hours post-burst).
Total summed exposure times for each observation amounted
to 36 minutes in I and 30 minutes in J.

The afterglow of GRB 060526 is visible in each combine image.
The preliminary magnitudes reported below were calibrated using
several USNO-B1.0 stars in the I-band and two 2MASS standards in J.
[The errors on the photometric calibration are ~0.2 in I and ~0.02
in J; these errors are in addition to the statistical errors listed
below.]

 8.7 hours      18.99 +/- 0.02          18.16 +/- 0.06
11.6 hours      19.31 +/- 0.02          18.58 +/- 0.07


The afterglow decay index is constrained by our observations to be
alpha = 1.2 +/- 0.2 from 8.7 to 11.6 hours post-burst.  This
value is in agreement with the decay value from 5 to 16 hours
post-burst reported by Khamitov et al. (GCN 5173)
and Halpern et al. (GCN 5176).

We observed the error box of GRB060526 (Campana et al. GCN5162) in Nordic
Optical Telescope with ALFOSC between (UT)  June 05 23:37 and June 06 00:41.
We do not detect the optical afterglow. Limiting magnitude of a combined
image of total exposure 10x300  is R~ 24.6.  Based on last 3 points of TT150
(Khamitov et al.  GCNs 5186, 5189, 5193) the limiting magnitude R=24.6 at
mid time (UT) June 06.0125 (T0+10.486d) is compatible with X-ray power law
decay index   2.8+/-0.1 (Moretti et al., GCN5194). While no sources are
detected within refined XRT error circle  (Campana et. GCN5168)  faint
galaxy (R=24.4 +/- 0.3) is detected at (J2000) RA = 15:31:18.2  Dec =
+00:17:12.7.  Taking into account redshift of the OT of GRB060526 z=3.21
(Berger and Gladders GCN5170) it is unlikely that the
detected galaxy is connected with GRB060526.

S. Campana (INAF-OAB), A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), C. Guidorzi
(Bicocca Univ. &amp; INAF-OAB), G. Chincarini (Bicocca Univ. &amp;
INAF-OAB), D.N. Burrows (PSU) on behalf of the Swift-XRT team
report:

We have analysed the first orbit of Swift/XRT data of GRB 060526
(Campana et al., GCN 5162 and GCN 5163) summing up 1773 s of data
in Photon Counting (PC) and 334 s in Window Timing (WT) mode,
respectively. We find a refined XRT position for this burst of:

RA(J2000)  = 15 31 18.41
Dec(J2000) = +00 17 05.7

with an error of 3.6 arcseconds radius (90% containment).
This position is 2.8 arcseconds from the XRT position quoted by
Campana et al. (GCN 5163) and 1.1 arcseconds from the UVOT position.

The afterglow shows several states: the XRT started observing the
GRB at T+73 s. For the first 53 s (up to T+126 s) the XRT remained
in WT mode with a slowly decaying count rate (power law decay of
-1.4+/-0.9, 90% confidence). Then it switched to PC mode continuing
its slow decay up to T+206 s when a bright flare carry back the
XRT in WT mode. The flare is made of two flares with FRED-like
shape. The first peak reached &gt;335 c/s (being slightly piled-up at
level count rate level) around T+240 s and the second about 200 c/s
around T+295 s. The decay from the first peak is very steep (as
measured from T), with an power law index of -7.7+/-0.7 and also
from the second with -8.6+/-0.2. The second flare shows some
structures close to the peak.
The PC data show the latest stages of the flare and then a break
to a much flatter decay (-0.7+/-0.5) around 600 s (further data
will improve the determination of the time of this break).
This does not allow a first prediction of the flux at one day.

 From the spectral point of view, PC data before and after the flare
are consistent with a simple power law (photon index 1.8+/-0.2) at
a column density consistent with the Galactic value NH&lt;1x10^21 cm^-2
(NH_g=6x10^20 cm^-2).
Flux in the first WT data is 1.7x10^-10 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (unabsorbed
0.3-10 keV) and in the last PC data 1.6x10^-10 erg s^-1 cm^-2.
Considering pre- and post-flare WT and PC data some spectral evolution
is observed, this can be explained with a spectral softening or a
column density decrease.
The spectrum of the first flare (excluded the brightest piled-up
portion) is consistent with a simple power law with photon index
around 1.8 and a column density larger than the values reported above,
likely indicating a fast evolving cut-off power law.
The second flare is much softer with with a power law photon index
around 2.6. Also in this case the column density is slightly larger
than the previous values. Being not piled-up we can estimate a mean
0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux of 8x10^-9 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (from T+215 to
T+304 s).

on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:

Using the data set from T-119 to T+1000 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 060526 (trigger #211957)
(Campana, et al., GCN 5162 &amp; 5163).  The BAT ground-calculated position
is RA,Dec = 232.838,+0.292 deg {15h 31m 21.0s,+0d 17' 32.9"} (J2000)
+- 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).  The partial coding
was 61%.
 
As noted in GCN 5163, there are two well separated episodes of emission
detected in the BAT instrument.
The initial emission contains two FRED-like peaks, the first starting at
T-3sec, peaking at T+1, and ending at T+5 sec; and the second starts 
at T+6 sec, peaks at T+7 sec, and returns back to the background level
at T+13 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) for this first episode is 13.8 +- 2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).  The scond episode consists
of a single symmetric peak at T+250 sec (230 to 270 sec).  This second
episode is coicident with the XRT flare described in GCN 5168.
 
For the first episode, the time-averaged spectrum from T-1.3 to T+17.0
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.66 +- 0.20.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 4.9 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.17 sec in the
15-150 keV band is 1.7 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.
For the second episode, the time-averaged spectrum from T+230 to T+270
is best fit by a simple power-law model.  The power law index
of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.07 +- 0.18.  The fluence
in the 15-150 keV band is 5.9 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.  This is slightly
more fluence than the first episode, but only about half the peak flux.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.

P. J. Brown (Penn State), S. Campana (INAF-OAB),
P. T. Boyd (NASA/GSFC), &amp; F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC),
report on behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

The afterglow of GRB060526 (BAT Trigger 211957)
reported in Campana et al. (GCN 5162) is also
detected by UVOT in the B filter, as well as the
previously reported V and White filters,
and continues to fade.  We report the following
additional UVOT detections:

Filter	Tstart-Tstop(s)	Exp(s)	Mag	Err
White	6335-6534	200	19.2	0.2
V	5311-5511	200	18.2	0.2
V	6744-6944	200	18.6	0.2
B	665-675  	10	18.2	0.4
B	6130-6330 	200	19.4	0.2

The afterglow is not detected in any filters
blueward of B, consistent with the z=3.21 redshift
measured by Berger &amp; Gladders (GCN 5170).
The 3 sigma upper limits in summed images are:

Filter	Tstart-Tstop(s)	Exp(s)	UpperLimit(3sigma)
U	641-1492	58	&gt;19.1
W1	617-1468	58	&gt;19.1
M2	593-1444	58	&gt;19.0
W2	693-1554	78	&gt;19.6

In addition, examination of the event mode data of
the first V band observation, spanning 188 to 588
seconds after the trigger, shows an optical flare
coincident with the flare seen by BAT and XRT
(Campana et al. GCN 5163).

DATE:    06/05/30 16:43:38 GMT
FROM:    Christina Thoene at Niels Bohr Institute,DARK Cosmo Ctr  <cthoene@astro.ku.dk>

D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) and C. C. Thoene (DARK Cosmology Center)
report:


Gathering further data from the GCN (Khamitov et al., GCN 5183, 5186,
Baliyan et al., GCN 5185) in addition to those referenced in Kann &amp;
Hoegner (GCN 5182), we perform fits to the R afterglow light curve.

A single power law fit to all data beyond 6000 seconds yields alpha = 1.04
+/- 0.01, but the late-time data beyond two days lie significantly beneath
the fit.

A broken power law gives a better fit, with alpha_1 = 0.98 +/- 0.10,
alpha_2 = 2.06 +/- 0.13, and break time t_b = 1.76 +/- 0.1 days. The break
smoothness parameter n is fixed to 10.
Still, the fit is not acceptable, with strong deviations around 0.5 days.

Fitting separate parts of the light curve, we find a better fit with a
double broken power law. The first part (0.19 to 1.1 days) is described by
alpha_1 = 1.35 +/- 0.07, alpha_2 = 0.85 +/- 0.08 and t_b = 0.44 +/- 0.08
days, n = -10 fixed. The fit is marginally acceptable, with
deviations due to scatter (different zero points and comparison stars).

The second part (0.53 days to the end) is described by alpha_1 = 0.76 +/-
0.04, alpha_2 = 1.87 +/- 0.07 and t_b = 1.42 +/- 0.08 days, n = 10 fixed.
This fit is acceptable. Alpha_2 of the first part and alpha_1 of the
second part are identical within errors, as expected. We note that the
extension of this last fit to early times is consistent with the first
ROTSE data point (Rykoff et al., GCN 5166) and marginally consisten with
the very early Watcher data (French &amp; Jelinek, GCN 5165).

This strengthens the picture that the break first described by Thoene et
al. (GCN 5179) is the jet break. The post-break decay is relatively
smooth.

We caution that these fits do not include the dense data set presented by
Halpern, Armstrong &amp; Mirabal (GCN 5176) and the optical flare they
detected. Similar to early fits of GRB 030329 presented in the GCN, these fits may
be the result of inhomogenous coverage of a highly variable light curve.

Further deep monitoring is encouraged.

Christina C. Thoene, Johan P.U. Fynbo (DARK Cosmology Centre), Uffe G.

We observed the OT of GRB060526 (GCN 5162, GCN 5166) with the Danish 1.54m
telescope and DFOSC on La Silla in the R-band at several epochs on May 26
and May 27.

A fit to our data from the first night gives a powerlaw decay with a
temporal decay index of 0.86, whereas the data obtained at the second
night are well fitted by a powerlaw with index 1.73. Therefore, in
contrast to the flattening reported in GCN 5177, we observe a considerable
steepening of the lightcurve between the first and the second night and a
possible break between the two nights.

FROM:    Alexander Kann at TLS Tautenburg  <kann@tls-tautenburg.de>

D. A. Kann &amp; C. Hoegner (Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg) report:

The afterglow of GRB 060526 (Campana et al., GCN 5162) was observed with the 
Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope in the R band in inclement conditions (passing 
clouds). A total of four 600 sec exposures were obtained, each significantly deeper than the 
DSS. The afterglow is detected in each image. We measure the magnitude from a stack of 
all four images, using the magnitude Khamitov et al. (GCN 5177) derived for the USNO star 
at RA=15:31:18.6, Dec=+00:17:34.9 (R=16.848):

Epoch		dt (days)	Rc	dRc
28.9768	2.2904		21.55	0.13

We collect data from Rykoff et al. (GCN 5166), Covino et al. (GCN 5167), Greco et al. 
(GCN 5171), Khamitov et al. (GCN 5173), Morgan &amp; Dai (GCN 5175), Khamitov et al. (GCN 
5177), Thoene et al. (GCN 5179) and Rumyantsev &amp; Pozanenko (GCN 5181). This data set 
can be fit by a single power law with slope alpha = 0.99 +/- 0.01, starting at 6000 seconds 
after the burst (Rykoff et al., GCN 5166). But we find significant deviations from the power 
law, as high as 0.3 mags above and below (cf. Halpern et al., GCN 5176) the fit, leading to 
a high chi^2. This behaviour is reminiscent of GRBs 021004 and 030329. For the data 
beyond 1.3 days, we find alpha = 1.64 +/- 0.17, in agreement with Thoene et al. (GCN 
5179).

Our data can not rule out that a break in the light curve has occured, lying well on the 
extrapolation of the data of Thoene et al. (GCN 5179). If so, the post jet-break decay slope 
is very shallow. The afterglow is thus well-suited for further follow-up, and dense R band 
imaging is encouraged.

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 060526 (Swift trigger 211957, GCN 5162). The first 
image was at 17:15:11.1 UT, 2801.1 s after the burst.  The unfiltered 
images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0.  We detect a 17.5th 
magnitude, fading source with coordinates:

   15:31:18.3    +00:17:03.7 (J2000)

This is consistent with the Swift/UVOT position reported in GCN 5162.

The afterglow did not fade significantly between 2800s and ~6000s 
post-burst, when it was at ~ 17.5 mag.  At 6000s the lightcurve had a 
break, and started decaying as a smooth power-law with index ~-1.  At 
13000 s post-burst, the afterglow is at 18.4+/-0.05 mag.  Observations 
are continuing.

M. Stamatikos (NASA/ORAU), G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB) and
D. E. Vanden Berk (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

Following up the report of the Swift GRB (Campana, et al., GCN 5162),
we note that the BAT lightcurve shows a well separated second period
of emission starting at ~T+220 sec and lasting until ~T+270 sec. 
The shape of the emission is FRED-like.  Based on the 4-band TDRSS
lightcurve, this second emission is significantly softer that the 
original emission at T+0. 

Based on initial data we find a refined XRT position of 
RA(J2000): 15 31 18.27, DEC(J2000): +00 17 07.6, with an error 
radius of 4.3 arcsec (90% confidence) and 3 arcsec from the previously 
reported UVOT candidate position. The XRT light curve shows a sharp 
increase in the count rate starting around T+220 s from burst trigger, 
approximately coincident with the second BAT peak. 

As shown in the table below, UVOT sees a fading afterglow in 
the four finding chart exposures for this burst. In the table,
T is the time in seconds since the BAT trigger at the start 
of the exposure. 

  T  Exposure Filter  Magnitude
  83  100     White    17.6
 188  400     V        17.2
 866  400     V        17.8
1274  100     White    18.4

We note that the location of this burst is ~11.3 hours from the Sun
and therefore well suited for ground-based follow-ups. 
There is no bright galaxy at this location in the archived SDSS images. 
We will start receiving the full downlinked data set around 18:00 UT.

report:

We continue our observations of the optical counterpart of GRB060526
(Campana et al. GCN 5162; French &amp; Jelinek GCN 5165; Rykoff et al. GCN 5166)
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe,TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey). A series of frames were taken on May 30. The afterglow
is detected on combined images in both V and R bands.

We estimate the following Rc magnitudes for the OT:

    t-t0  m_R     err
  104.05  23.14   0.09

Our Rc lightcurve can be found at:

http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/grb/060526/lc_0530.jpg

In combination with MDM 1.3-m observations (Halpern et al., GCN 5188) these
data suggest that the OT light curve can not be fitted by a combination of
power laws and contain several optical flares.

Richard J. Cool (Arizona), Daniel J. Eisenstein (Arizona),
David W. Hogg (NYU), Michael R. Blanton (NYU), David
J. Schlegel (LBNL), J. Brinkmann (APO), Donald Q. Lamb
(Chicago), Donald P. Schneider (PSU), and Daniel E. Vanden
Berk (PSU) report:

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaged the field of
burst GRB060526 prior to the burst.  As these data should
be useful as a pre-burst comparison and for calibrating
photometry, we are supplying the images and photometry
measurements for this GRB field to the community.

Data from the SDSS, including 5 FITS images, 3 JPGS, and
3 files of photometry and astrometry, are being placed
at http://mizar.as.arizona.edu/~grb/public/GRB060526

We supply FITS images in each of the 5 SDSS bands of a
8'x8' region centered on the GRB position (ra=232.827
(15:31:18.4), dec=0.286400 (00:17:11.0); GCN 5162),
as well as 3 gri color-composite JPGs (with different
stretches). The units in the FITS images are nanomaggies
per pixel.  A pixel is 0.396 arcsec on a side. A nanomaggie
is a flux-density unit equal to 10^-9 of a magnitude
0 source or, to the extent that SDSS is an AB system,
3.631e-6 Jy.  The FITS images have WCS astrometric
information.

In the file GRB060526_sdss.calstar.dat, we report
photometry and astrometry of 753 bright stars (r&lt;20.5)
within 15' of the burst location.  The magnitudes presented
in this file are asinh magnitudes as are standard in the
SDSS (Lupton 1999, AJ, 118, 1406). Beware that some of
these stars are not well-detected in the u-band; use the
errors and object flags to monitor data quality.

In the files GRB060526_sdss.objects_flux.dat and
GRB060526_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat, we report photometry
of 1467 objects detected within 6' of the GRB position.
We have removed saturated objects and objects with
model magnitudes fainter than 23.0 in the r-band.
The fluxes listed in GRB060526_sdss.objects_flux.dat
are in nanomaggies while the magnitudes listed in
GRB060526_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat are asinh magnitudes.

All quantities reported are standard SDSS photometry,
meaning that they are very close to AB zeropoints
and magnitudes are quoted in asinh magnitudes.
Photometric zeropoints are known to about 2% rms.
None of the photometry is corrected for dust extinction.
The Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998) predictions
for this region are A_U=0.337 mag, A_g=0.248 mag, A_r =
0.180 mag, A_i=0.136 mag, and A_z=0.097 mag.

The file GRB060526_sdss.spectro.dat contains a list of
the 5 objects with SDSS spectroscopy within 6 arcminutes
of the GRB position.  In addition to the redshift and
1-sigma error for each object, this file also lists the
object spectroscopic classification.


SDSS astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcsecond
per coordinate.  Users requiring high precision astrometry
should take note that the SDSS astrometric system can
differ from other systems such as those used in other
notices; we have not checked the offsets in this region.

More detailed information pertaining to our SDSS GRB
releases can be found in our initial data release paper
(Cool et al. 2006, astro-ph/0601218).  See the SDSS DR4
documentation for more details: http://www.sdss.org/dr4.

These data have been reduced using a slightly different
pipeline than that used for SDSS public data releases.
We cannot guarantee that the values here will exactly match
those in the data release in which these data are included.
In particular, we expect the photometric calibrations to
differ by of order 0.01 mag.

This note may be cited, but please also cite the SDSS data
release paper, Adelman-McCarthy et al. (2006, ApJS, in
press, astro-ph/0507711), when using the data or referring
to the technical documentation.

We observed the field of GRB 060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162) with  
the robotic 60 cm REM telescope located at La Silla ESO Observatory  
(Chile). The GRB was not visible from La Silla at the trigger time  
and REM started acquiring automatically a set of infrared images  
(J,H,K filters) at 23:08:56 UT (about 6.67 hours after the burst)  
when the target became visibile. The integration time was 100s in  
each filter. A second set of images was taken starting at 03:56:19 UT  
with the same observing setting.

The analysis of both dataset do not show any infrared source at the  
position of the optical afterglow (Rykoff et al. GCN 5166, Campana et  
al. GCN 5168) down to the 3-sigma upper limit magnitudes J=16.5,  
H=16.2, K=15.8.

R. M. Wagner (LBTO/OSU), J. Rhoads (Ariz State), E. Egami, J. Bechtold,
S. Herbert-Fort (UAz) report:

The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) imaged the position of the GRB 070311
afterglow (Mereghetti et al, GCN 6189; Covino et al. GCN 6190) with the
LBC-blue CCD camera (http//lbc.mporzio.astro.it) and 8.4-m SX mirror on
2007 March 17.14 (UT). Ten dithered, 200 second exposures were obtained
with the Sloan-r filter in 0.65" seeing. After combining the images, the
afterglow is clearly detected. No obvious GRB host galaxy is visible. The
field is filled with clouds of faint emission due to the low Galactic
latitude of the region.

The comparison star used by Halpern &amp; Armstrong (GCN 6195; star "A"
with USNO-B1.0 R2=16.67 mag) is heavily saturated in the LBT data,
so we obtained short exposure images of the field with LBC-blue to
calibrate a fainter star ("B") at 5:50:10.341, 03:23:02.58 (J2000).
The difference in brightness between star A and B is 2.62+/-0.01 mag.
in Sloan-r and this is confirmed with R-band images taken at MDM
(E. Armstrong, private communication). From point-spread-function fitting
photometry, the afterglow is 5.44+/-0.06 mag fainter than comparison
star B or at a brightness of R2=16.67+2.62+5.44= 24.73+/-0.06 mag.

The brightness of the afterglow 6.0 days after the GRB suggests that it
has continued a very steep decline after its optical flare
(Halpern &amp; Armstrong GCN 6203). The afterglow has not resumed the shallow
decay it followed on the first day after the GRB. A late flare
occurring just before the break resembles GRB 000301c (Garnavich, Loeb &amp;
Stanek 2000, ApJ, 544, 11; Rhoads &amp; Fruchter 2001, ApJ 546, 117)
and GRB 060526 (Dai et al. 2006, astro-ph/0609269).

The light curve of 070311 is available at:

DATE:    06/06/01 18:54:41 GMT
FROM:    David Burrows at PSU/Swift  <dxb15@psu.edu>

A. Moretti (INAF-OAB), D.N. Burrows (PSU) , S. Campana (INAF-OAB),
G. Chincarini (UNIMIB, INAF-OAB), and G. Tagliaferri (INAF-OAB)
report on behalf of the Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed six days of Swift XRT data from GRB 060526
(Campana et al., GCN5162), with a total exposure of 70ks.  After the
flaring episodes between 200s and 400s interval from the trigger,
already reported in Campana et al. (GCN 5168), the light curve
presents a shallow decay with slope -0.7(+-0.1) until (1.1+-0.3)e5
seconds after the trigger (1.2+-0.3 days). Superimposed on the
shallow decay a small bump is present at 7 ks.

At (1.1+-0.3)e5 seconds the light curve breaks to a much steeper slope
of (-2.8+-0.1).  We note that this slope is very similar to the optical decay
slope of the last five data points obtained by the RTT150 telescope
(Khamitov et al., GGNs 5186, 5189, and 5193, slope ~ -2.75), and that the
X-ray break time also seems to correspond roughly to a break in the
general trend of the optical light curve (e.g., Thoene et al., GCN 5179;
Kann and Hoegner, GCN 5182; Kann and Thoene, GCN 5187;
although the slopes reported in these circulars are shallower than
those seen in the XRT light curve and in the last 5 RTT150 data points).
On the other hand, the optical light curve is quite complex
(Halpern, Amstrong, and Mirabel, GCNs 5176, 5188).

If interpreted as a jet break, the jet opening half-angle for this burst is
about 4.7 degrees x (Eiso/10^53)^(-1/8) x (n/10 cm^-3)^(1/8).
Using the total BAT fluence, we obtain Eiso = 2.3e52 ergs
(15-150 keV observed frame), which would correspond to 5.6 degrees
for the jet opening angle.  We did not extrapolate Eiso into the usual
energy band due to the limited energy range of the BAT and the single
power law fit to the BAT spectrum, but we expect that the jet angle
should be in the range of 4-5 degrees.  A lower density would reduce
this angle.

This Circular is an official product of the Swift XRT Team.

J. P. Halpern (Columbia U.), E. Armstrong (UCSD), &amp; N. Mirabal (U. Michigan) 
report on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"Using the MDM 1.3m telescope on Kitt Peak, we obtained a continuous R-band
time series of the afterglow of Swift GRB 060526 (Campana et al. GCN 5162), 
consisting of 40 10-minute exposures, from 11.0 to 18.2 hours after the burst.  
Preliminary photometry was performed using comparison stars in r' from the
SDSS calibration (Cool et al. GCN 5164).  In addition, wherever possible, we 
placed other GCN reported R-band photometry (Covino et al. GCN 5167; 
Khamitov et al. GCN 5173; Morgan &amp; Dai GCN 5175) on a common scale using the 
SDSS r' magnitudes of their indicated comparison stars.  As a result, we find 
that a power-law decay index of -1.18 +/- 0.05 fitted to the Khamitov et al. 
data alone from 5.6 to 8.9 hours also fits the MDM light curve very well, until 
about 16 hours after the burst.  At that time, a flare began that had a rise 
time of about 40 minutes, followed by a slower decay, and had not yet returned 
to the extrapolated power law when the observations were terminated at twilight.
The peak of the flare occurred around May 27 09:06 UT, and reached about 0.3 
magnitudes above the extrapolation.

In combination with the multiple episodes of gamma-ray and X-ray emission
(Campana et al. GCNs 5163, 5168; Markwardt et al. GCN 5174) and the long
plateau in the early optical light curve (Rykoff et al. GCN 5166), these
results indicate the possibility of extended and complex activity from
GRB 060526 that warrants intensive monitoring.

A preliminary version of the MDM optical light curve and incorporated
GCN data is available at
