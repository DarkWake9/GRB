SUBJECT: GRB 110820A: CQUEAN izY Observation
DATE:    11/08/21 08:14:40 GMT
FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

Myungshin Im, Won-Kee Park (CEOU/Seoul National Univ), 
Soojong Pak, Giseon Baek, and Youngseok Oh (Kyunghee University)

We observed GRB 100820A (Troja et al. GCN 12288) with i,z,and 
Y-filters using CQUEAN camera (the Camera for QUasars in the Early uNiverse) 
on the 2.1m telescope at the McDonald observatory. The observation 
started at 2010 August 21, 05:12:48 UT, about 11.5 hrs after the 
BAT trigger.

In a stacked i-band image (3 x 300 sec), we identify a faint object
within the error circle of the enhanced XRT position (Beardmore et al.
GCN 12291).

The position of the i-band source is

  RA=22:52:49.49
  Dec=70:17:53.6
  with a positional error of ~0.5".

We are carrying our further observations to examine variability 
of the source.
