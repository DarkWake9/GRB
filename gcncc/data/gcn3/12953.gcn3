We observed GRB 120211A (Sonbas et al., GCN 12920) in SDSS i,z-bands with a 1 m telescope at Mt. Lemmon, Arizona, U.S.
The obsevation started at 04:03:00 2012-02-12 UT, ~ 17 hours after the burst alert.
We took 4 frames for each filter alternatively with the exposure time 300s.
No afterglow candidate was found in the enhanced XRT position (Goad et al., GCN12922) in stacked images of both i and z.

We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for this observation.
