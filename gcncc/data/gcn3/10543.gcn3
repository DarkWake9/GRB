INAF-OAPd  report on behalf of a larger colaboration that a high-dispersion
optical spectrum (range  350-900 nm, resolution 0.02 nm) of the afterglow
associated to GRB  100316D (cf. GCN 10496) was obtained with the VLT telescope  
(+XShooter) at ESO-Paranal on March 23.04 UT. The spectrum of  the  
source located at R.A.=07:10:31.8 and Decl.=-56:15:20.2, J2000.0 (as  
measured on the XShooter acquisition image) shows very broad bumps   
with peaks measured at about 430nm and 670nm reminiscent of an  
emerging broad line type Ic supernova (in agreement with Chornock et al,
GCN 10541). Indeed, above 600 nm the spectrum of this source
shows some similarities with that of SN 1998bw (Patat et al. 2001,
ApJ, 555, 900) taken 7 days after outburst.

There are however major differences  with the spectrum of this  
transient, showing a significant flux deficiency in the range  
450-550nm in comparison with SN 1998bw .
