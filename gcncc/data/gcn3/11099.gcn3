A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 03:50:08.81 UT on 14 August 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100814A (trigger 303450610 / 100814160),
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Beardmore et al. 2008, GCN 11087)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 87.2 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of several pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 149 +/- 1 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.003 s to T0+157.57 s is
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 106.4 +13.9/-12.6 keV,
alpha = -0.64 +0.14/-0.12, and beta = -2.02 +0.09/-0.12
(Castor C-STAT 807 for 484 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.98  +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+6.784 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
