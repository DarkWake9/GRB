X.-H. Zhao (YNAO), D. Xu (WIS), J.-R. Mao, J.-M. Bai (YNAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 111117A (Mangano et al., GCN 12559) at
the 2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu telescope (GMG) equipped with YFOSC. The weather
was not optimistic but 1x600s R-band and 3x600s z-band images were
obtained, starting at 14:11:16 UT, 17 Nov. 2011 (i..e, 1.960 hrs after
the burst). No afterglow was detected within the XRT error circle for
both filters, to a 3sigma upper limit of R~22.2 mag, calibrated with
the USNO B1 catalog.

We thank Gui-Hua He, Jian-Quan He, and Yu-Xin Xin for performing these
observations.
