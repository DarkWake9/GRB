GRB 980326
     A. Guarnieri, C. Bartolini, A. Piccioni and G. Valentini
University of Bologna, communicate:  "A preliminary analysis 
of two combined 30 min. CCD frames of the GRB 980326 field 
obtained with the Bologna University 1.5-m telescope in R band
on March 27.84 UT with a seeing of 2".8 does not show the OT
(mag. limit of the plates about 22).  We can state that it was 
fainter than the second comparison star measured by Groot et al. 
(IAUC 6852), so its R magnitude was > 21.7.
