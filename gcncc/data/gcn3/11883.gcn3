Sushanta K. Mondal (ICSP), Sandip K. Chakrabarti (S. N. Bose Centre and ICSP),
Asit Choudhury (ICSP, Malda branch), Achintya Chatterjee (ICSP, Malda Branch),
and D. Bhowmick (ICSP)

Indian Centre for Space Physics observed the ionospheric perturbation
due to GRB 090424 (GCN No. 9316) through monitoring VLF signals from various
transmitters.
The final analysis with corrected time stamp
(http://www.bose.res.in/~chakraba/grb090424.html) suggests
that VLF signals were spreaded out for few seconds due to ionospheric effects.
