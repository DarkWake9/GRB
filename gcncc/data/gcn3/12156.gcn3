A. Zauderer, E. Berger, and W. Fong (Harvard) report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the position of GRB 110709A (GCN #12118) with the EVLA at
5.8 GHz and 22 GHz starting on 2011 July 10.12 UT (~12 hours after the
burst).  In ~20 min integration time on source at each frequency, no
radio source is detected within the XRT error circle (GCN #12123) to a
3-sigma limit of 60 microJy/bm (5.8 GHz) and 104 microJy/bm (22 GHz).

We acknowledge the EVLA staff for their support of these observations.
