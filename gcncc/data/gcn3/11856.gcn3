    We continued NIR observation of GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451
  using the KASINICS on the 1.8m telescope at Mt. Bohyun Observatory
  in Korea.

    The observation started at 2011 March 31, 14:45:20 UT, and we
  obtained a series of images in H and K.

    The NIR counterpart is clearly detected in both bands,
  with the K-band magnitude at 17.29 +- 0.03.
    Comparison with the K-band magnitude of the same object from
  the previous night data (Im et al. GCN 11850) shows the dimming
  of the object by 0.43  mag over one day.
    The H-band data also show variability, confirming the variability
  of the source reported earlier (Leval et al. GCN 11854)

    More NIR imaging is planned.
