K. Hornoch (Astronomical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic) & P. Kubanek (IPL UV Valencia & IAA CSIC Granada, Spain)
reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We acquired unfiltered CCD images of GRB 100302A XRT error box
(J.R.Cummings, GCN 10458) with Ondrejov 65cm telescope + CCD. AS the CCD
is equipped with IR-block filter its sensitivity in I band is very close to 0.

Observation started March 3 00:40 UT (4h47m after the BAT trigger).
During observation which run till 03:00 UT 45 of 3 minutes exposures were
obtained. On the combined image we do not identify any new object down to 
R ~22 magnitude. Particularly we do not see anything significant at the
proposed OT position (K.Y. Huang, GCN 10461).
