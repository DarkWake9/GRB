C. R. Klein and A. N. Morgan (U. C. Berkeley) report:

We observed the field of GRBs 110928A (Hoverston et al., GCN 12394) with the
1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, AZ. Observations began at 2011-Sep-28
02h03m59s, 12.5 minutes after the GRB. In mosaics (effective exposure time
of 468s) taken simultaneously in the J, H, and Ks filters, we do not clearly
detect any new sources in the BAT error circle down to the limit of the
2mass catalog.
