Using the data set from T-240 to T+878 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110201A (trigger #444230)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 11622).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 137.489, 88.610 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  09h 09m 57.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +88d 36' 36.9" 
with an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 97%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows 3 or 4 overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-2 sec, peaking at ~T_zero, and ending at ~T+30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 13.0 +- 2.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.8 to T+13.3 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.09 +- 0.11.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.0 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
