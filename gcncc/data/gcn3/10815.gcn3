P. Afonso (MPE Garching), A. Nicuesa, A. Rossi, S. Klose (TLS Tautenburg),
T. Kruehler, A. Yoldas and J. Greiner (MPE Garching), report on behalf 
of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 100528A discovered by SuperAGILE (Del Monte et
al., GCN #10810) and observed also by Fermi/GBM (Rau & van der Horst, 
GCN #10811),
simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al.2008, PASP 120, 
405)
mounted at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile).

Observations started at 07:49 UT on March 30, 54 hours after the GRB
trigger. At the position of the UVOT detection (Grupe et al., GCN #10813)
we detect and confirm the afterglow mentioned also by Xu et al. (GCN 
#10814).

Based on stacked images with a total integration time of 40 minutes in 
JHK and
50 minutes in g'r'i'z' we estimate the following preliminary magnitudes
(all in the AB system):

g' = 21.93+-0.08
r' = 21.56+-0.04
i' = 21.27+-0.05
z' = 21.36+-0.07
J  = 20.49+-0.10
H  = 20.25+-0.12
K  = 20.46+-0.21

All magnitudes given above are calibrated against SDSS and 2MASS field 
stars.
No correction has been applied for the large, uncertain Galactic foreground
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V)~ 0.22 in the direction
of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).
