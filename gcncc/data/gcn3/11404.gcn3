"Poonam Chandra (RMC), Dale A. Frail (NRAO) and S. Bradley Cenko (Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We
 observed the INTEGRAL long burst GRB 101112A (Gotz et al. GCN 11396) 
with the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) in 33.56 GHz frequency on 2010
 November 13 starting at 01:11:17 UT, around 3 hours after the detection of the 
GRB.  We have a
 possible detection of the radio afterglow within the  Liverpool 
telescope optical error circle (Guidorzi et al. GCN 11397) with a flux 
density of 149+/54 uJy. The peak flux position of the radio afterglow is
 J2000: RA 19:28:54.88, Dec 39:21:10.81. 

Note that this is the fastest response of a GRB alert by the EVLA which is currently in the commissioning phase. We thank the EVLA staff for scheduling our observations so promptly. The 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science
 Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities,
 Inc."
