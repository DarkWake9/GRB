S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and E. A. Hoversten (PSU)
report on the behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

      The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 100805A starting 112 s
after the BAT trigger (Hoversten, et al., 2010, GCN Circ. 11047).
Settled observations started at 130 s.  We detect the optical
afterglow (Hoversten, et al., 2010, GCN Circ, 11047) in all filters
except uvw2.  The refined UVOT position is

     RA (J2000) =  19:59:30.51  =  299.87713 (deg)
    Dec (J2000) = +52:37:40.1   =  +52.62783 (deg)

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.43 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence,
statistical + systematic).  This is 1.31 arcsec west of the
UVOT-enhanced XRT position (Goad, et al., 2010, GCN Circ. 11053).

     Preliminary magnitudes, and 3-sigma upper limits for detecting a
source in the finding charts and in the co-added images, are

     The quoted magnitudes and upper limits have not been corrected
for the expected Galactic extinction along the line of sight
corresponding to a reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.19 mag (Schlegel, et al.,
1998, ApJS, 500, 525).  All photometry is on the UVOT photometry
system described in Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).

     The non-detection in the UVOT uvw2 filter, and the observed UVOT
spectral energy distribution at 4895 s, is consistent with GRB 100805A
having a redshift of approximately z = 1.3, although we can not rule
out the non-detection in uvw2 being due to extinction in the host
galaxy.  The white light curve exhibits a power-law decay with an
index of alpha = -0.71 +/- 0.03, consistent with what was observed by
Cenko, et al. (2010, GCN Circ. 11051).
