TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB010921 Optical Observations

D. Q. Lamb, D. G. York, R. J. McMillan and D. Johnston report:

We have observed the improved HETE error circle for GRB020127 (= H1902)
(GCN 1229) using the ARC 3.5-m telescope at APO under excellent seeing
conditions but a very bright moon on 2002 January 28 beginning at UT
01:38 (4.43 hours after the GRB).  A series of images covering an area
somewhat larger than the entire improved HETE error circle was acquired
in SDSS r' and i' filters.

Visual inspection of the series of r' and i' images reveals no new
object brighter than the DSS limiting magnitude for this field (R ~
19.5).

This message is quotable.

[GCN OPS NOTE (28Jan02):  See errata notice in GCN# 1231.]
