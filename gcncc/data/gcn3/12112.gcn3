D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), S.Mereghetti, A.Paizis (IASF-Milano),  J.  
Borkowski (CAMK, Torun), E. Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, M. Beck, V. Savchenko  
(ISDC, Versoix),
on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team  report:

a  gamma ray burst lasting about 50 s has been detected by IBAS in the  
IBIS/ISGRI data at 04:43:22  U.T. of July 8.

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:

   RA:  340.1208 [degrees]
   DEC: +53.9597 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 1.6  arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a  20-200 keV peak flux of about 0.8 ph/ 
cm2 s  (2 s integration time), and a fluence of about 2e-6 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will be posted at http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
