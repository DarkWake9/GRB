B. E. Cobb (GWU), reports:

Using the ANDICAM instrument on the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at CTIO,
we obtained optical imaging of the error region of GRB 110407A
(GCN 11894, Wolf et al.) with a mid-exposure time of
2011-04-08 02:12 UT (~12.1 hrs post-burst). The total summed
exposure time amounted to 36 minutes in I.

No optical sources is detected at the position of
the optical afterglow of GRB 110407A (GCN 11901, Chuang et al.;
GCN 11904, Malesani et al.; GCN 11906, Kann et al.) to
a limit of I > 20.3. Optical photometry is calibrated against
Landolt standard stars.
