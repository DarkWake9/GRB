M. Jelínek, J. C. Tello, J. Gorosabel and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC
Granada), on behalf of a larger collaboration, report:

"Following the detection of GRB 120816A (Page et al. GCNC 13654), the
BOOTES-2/TELMA 0.6m telescope (+COLORES) in southern Spain started to
observe the field about one hour after the GRB, as soon as the night
started, obtaining a series of unfiltered images. In particular, a
combination of 15x60s frames gathered around 20:24:35UT (i.e. T0+66min)
provides a limit of R > 18 at the position of the reported optical
counterpart (Rau and Kanbach GCNC 13657)."
