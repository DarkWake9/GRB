Littlejohns (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester), P. D'Avanzo
(INAF-OAB) and V.D'Elia report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 10 ks of XRT data for GRB 111121A (D'Elia  et al. GCN
Circ. 12578), from 66 s to 24.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 180 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 9 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Evans et
al. (GCN. Circ 12579).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=1.85 (+/-0.09). At T+217 s  the decay
steepens to an alpha of 3.7 (+1.2, -0.7). The light curve breaks again
at T+378 s to a decay with alpha=0.93 (+0.07, -0.08),  before a final
break at T+9772 s s after which the decay index is 2.1 (+0.5, -0.4).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.71 (+/-0.08). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.2 (+/-0.4) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.2 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.88 (+0.15, -0.17)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 3.4 (+/-0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 4.6 x 10^-11 (6.9 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     3.4 (+/-0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.2 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 8.0 sigma
Photon index:	     1.88 (+0.15, -0.17)
