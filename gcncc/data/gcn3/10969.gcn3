F. Olivares E., J. Greiner, P. Afonso (all MPE Garching), 
and S. Klose (TLS Tautenburg) report on behalf of the GROND team:

GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405), the 7-channel imager mounted 
at the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope on La Silla, started follow-up observations 
of GRB 100724A (Swift trigger 429868; Markwardt et al. 2010, GCN 10968) on 
July 24 at 0:45 UT (about 3 min after the trigger).

Within the revised 2.4 arcsec XRT error circle we find an afterglow 
candidate at position RA, Dec (J2000) = 12:58:10.4, -11:06:09, visible 
in all bands. We conclude that the redshift is less than 3.5.

Observations are ongoing.
