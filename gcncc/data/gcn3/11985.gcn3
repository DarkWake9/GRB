Maohai Huang (NAOC), Bing Zhang (UNLV), Dong Xu (WIS), Jinsong Deng
(NAOC), Liping Xin (NAOC), Yulei Qiu (NAOC) report on behalf of
Herschel OT1_mhuang01 Open Time program:

This is an update of ESA's schedule to search and observe far infrared
after glowof GRB 110422A using photometers of PACS (70,110micron) and
SPIRE (250, 350, 500micron) instruments on-board Herschel Space
Observatory, with sensitivities of several mJy/beam.

We strongly encourage ground and space instruments to collect data across
full spectral range, especially in X-ray, optical, near/mid IR,
millimeter/submillimeter, and radio bands, of GRB 110422A on observing
days of Herschel.
