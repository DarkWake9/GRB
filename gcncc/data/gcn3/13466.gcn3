TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13466
SUBJECT: GRB 120714A: Swift-XRT observations
DATE:    12/07/14 09:44:51 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

D.N. Burrows (PSU), J.A. Kennea (PSU), S. Campana (INAF-OAB), G.
Cusumano (INAF-IASF PA), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and J.P. Osborne (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 120714A at 08:41:02.2 UT,
3255.5 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 167.98413,
-30.62769 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 11h 11m 56.19s
   Dec(J2000) = -30d 37' 39.7"
with an uncertainty of 4.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 46 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We
cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 6.09
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).
