GRB 120311B field (Marshall et al., GCN Circ 13038) was observed 
with the newly installed 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope at 
Nainital. Several images in R_c pass-band (300 sec each) were taken 
in two sessions starting at UT 21:11:10, 11-03-2012.

In the initial co-added R_c frame (3x300sec), we did not detect any 
new optical source within the XRT error-box (Osborne et al., 
GCN Circ. 13042) down to a limiting magnitude of ~ 20.5 mag. 
The photometry was done in comparison to nearby USNO- B1 stars.
