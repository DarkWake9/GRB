"We are monitoring the optical afterglow of GRB110205A (GCN 11630,
11631) in g', r' and i' filters using the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lulin,
Taiwan. The observations are started at 2011 February 5, 13:02 UT.  
Based on our r'-band photometry against with the SDSS catalog, the
temporal decay index between 40000 and 52740 sec after the burst is
about 1.9.  The brightness in r'-band at 52740 sec after the burst is
20.64 +/-0.05 mag.

The further monitoring observation and analysis are ongoing.
