Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR), Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120521B detected by SWIFT
(trigger 522586) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the European Southern Observatory,
La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 88.8s after the GRB trigger
(25.6s after the notice). The elevation of the field decreased from
12 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were poor.

In a clean exposure, taken between T0 + 473.1s and T0 + 563.1s,
we do not detect any afterglow with a limiting magnitude of R > 17.2.


Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.

N.B. Galactic coordinates are lon=305.4846 lat=+10.0434
and the galactic extinction in R band is 1.2 magnitudes
estimated from D. Schlegel et al. 1998ApJ...500..525S.
