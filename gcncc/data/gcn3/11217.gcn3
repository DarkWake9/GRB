J.C. Tello, J. Gorosabel, A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC, Granada) P.
Kubanek (IAA-CSIC and IPL-UV) W. Allen (Vintage Lane Obs.), Ph. Yock
and Kuan-Yu Lin (Auckland Univ.), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have carried out  observations of the  Swift GRB 100904A
(Ukwatta et al. GCNC  11203) on Sep 4.2982 - 4.3145 UT (~5.98 hr after
the onset of the burst, mean observing time) with the 0.6m Yock-Allen
robotic telescope (BOOTES-3) located in Blenheim, New Zealand.
Observations were carried out at high airmass (~ 7).

We do not detect any optical source within the Swift-BAT refined analysis
error circle (Ukwatta et al. GCNC 11207).
The 3 sigma limiting magnitude of the co-added unfiltered image (Texp=16x60s)
is R ~ 18.0, using USNO-B1.0 as photometric reference."
