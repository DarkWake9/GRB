Millimeter observations of SGR 1900+14
----------------------------------------
M. Bremer, IRAM (Grenoble) and A.J. Castro-Tirado, IAA-CSIC (Granada) 
and LAEFF-INTA (Madrid) report:

We have observed the position of the proposed SGR 1900+14 radio 
counterpart reported by Frail et al. 1999 (Nature 398, 127) with 
the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer on April 24, 2001 between 
UT 1:13 - 3:04 (i.e. approximately six days after the giant flare 
reported by Guidorzi et al. in GCN 1041). 

The source was not detected. The following fluxes and 1-sigma errors 
(corrected for atmospheric decorrelation) were measured on the 
phase center:

 92.772 GHz: -0.64 +- 0.60 mJy/beam  (beam: 10.4" x 5.2" by PA=-55 deg.)
217.829 GHz: -2.7  +- 2.8  mJy/beam  (beam: 4.5"  x 2.3" by PA=-47 deg.)

No bright sources were detected within the field of view of the 
primary beams (53" and 23", respectively).
