L. Elenin (KIAM),  A. Volnova (SAI MSU),  A. Pozanenko (IKI)  report on 
behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of IPN of hard intense GRB 111205A  (Hurley et al., 
GCN 12626; Golenetskii et al., GCN 12627) with 0.45-m telescope If ISON-NM 
observatory on Dec 8 (09:55:52 - 11:52:34 UT). We took several unfiltered 
images of  300 s exposure. All our images cover full IPN error box.  On a 
stacked image we do not find any new objects within IPN error box in 
comparison with DSS. We detect DSS source mentioned by Wolf & Hoversten in 
the XRT error circle (Wolf & Hoversten, GCN 12630).  However due to bad 
seeing we cannot resolve this source into separate sources of a double star 
(Kann et al., GCN 12636).

Photometry of the unresolved source based on several nearby USNO-B1.0 stars 
(R2 magnitudes) is the following:
