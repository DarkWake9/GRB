report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 08:46:00 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091208 (trigger=378554).  Swift could not slew to the burst
due to an Earth limb constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 0.274, +65.674 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 01m 06s
   Dec(J2000) = +65d 40' 25"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a FRED
structure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+49.7 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. A. Hoversten (hoversten AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
