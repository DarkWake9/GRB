We observed the field of Swift GRB 111208A
(Sakamoto et al., GCN 12628) with the Lightbuckets 0.43m
rental telescope LB-0002 in South Alpen, France. Ten 60 s
observations were carried out in the R filter starting
2011-12-08 at 17:04:45 UT (~ 31 ks after the GRB trigger).
This observation is in temporal coincidence with the Swift
XRT TOO observation which spanned from 24.3 ks to 34.9 ks
(Wolf et al., GCN 12631).

In the stacked R band image, we do not detect an optical
afterglow at the XRT location. Our upper-limit based on the
observation is given below.
