TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  11462
SUBJECT: GRB 101219A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    10/12/19 03:05:57 GMT
FROM:    Shashi Bhushan Pandey at ROTSE  <shaship@umich.edu>

S. B. Pandey (U Mich), W. Zheng (U Mich) and W. Rujopakarn (Steward),
report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 101219A (Swift trigger 440606; Gelbord J. M., GCN 11461),
producing images beginning 8.1 s after the GCN notice time. An automated
response took the first image at 02:31:48.0 UT, 12.0 s after the burst,
under fair conditions. We took 10 5-sec, 10 20-sec and 10 60-sec exposures.
These unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging
is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle, for both single
images and coadding into sets of 10. Individual images have limiting
magnitudes ranging from 15.7-17.2; we set the following specific limits.

start UT       end UT      t_exp(s)   mlim   t_start-tGRB(s)  Coadd?
