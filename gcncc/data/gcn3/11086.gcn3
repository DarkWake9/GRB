B. E. Schaefer (Louisiana State), E.S. Rykoff (UCSB), W. Rujopakarn 
(Steward), S. B. Pandey (U Mich), W. Zheng (U Mich), report on behalf of 
the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, 
responded to GRB 100814A (Swift trigger 431605). The first image was at 
03:55:01.1 UT, 289.8 s after the burst (4.1 s after the GCN notice time). 
The unfiltered images are calibrated relative to USNO A2.0. We detect a 
new object, not visible in the DSS (second epoch), nor in our first set of 
observations with coordinates:

     01:29:53.67      -17:59:41.58    (J2000), with positional uncertainty 
of 1" or better

A jpeg image is available at

object marked 29 is the candidate in question.

Continuing observations are in progress.
