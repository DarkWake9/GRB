S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift team:
 
Swift-BAT triggers 373679-373684 are not real.  They are due
to false positive detections in image-trigger mode while the 
the spacecraft star tracker was in loss-of-lock.

There is filtering code within GCN to prevent distribution
of Swift notices for image triggers that occur during star tracker
loss-of-lock intervals, but sometimes this filtering gets confused
(e.g. when the BAT_Position message is not received at GCN, or when
the messages carry over into the next orbit).  Receiving these
notices can be confusing because many notices of the sequence
you normally receive are missing.

Of the 69 messages received, 10 were distributed.  Please disregard
these notices.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
