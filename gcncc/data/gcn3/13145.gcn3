"At 01:20:31.51 UT on March 26, 2012, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 120326A (trigger 354417633 / 120326056) which was
triggered and detected by Swift (Siegel et al., GCN 13105).
The on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data,
is consistent with the locations seen by Swift.

The GBM light curve shows a single FRED-like event with a 
duration (T90) of about 12 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.584 to T0+13.824 s
is fit equally well by a Band and Comptonized Power Law function.

For the Band function, the parameters are: 
Epeak = 46.45 +/- 3.67 keV, alpha = -0.98 +/- 0.14, and beta = -2.53 +/- 0.15.
This results in a 1-s peak flux of 3.10 +/- 0.05 ph/s-cm^2 and a
yields a fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval 
of (3.539 +/- 0.174)E-06 erg/cm^2.  The C-Stat for this fit is
653.15 over 489 degrees of freedom.

For the Comptonized function, the parameters are: 
Epeak = 55.46 +/- 2.61 keV, and alpha = -1.21 +/- 0.08.
This results in a 1-s peak flux of 3.08 +/- 0.05 ph/s-cm^2.
Which yields a fluence (10-1000 kev) in this time interval of
(3.027 +/- 0.091)E-06 erg/s-cm^2.  The C-Stat for this fit is
654.83 over 490 degrees of freedom.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
