S.D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and P. Evans (U Leicester) for the Swift team:

Using the BAT data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we confirm that Swift-BAT trigger 525554 (Gehrels, et al., GCN Circ. 13401)
is due to noise and is not anything astrophysical.

We have 9ks of XRT data, starting at T+130s and going out to T+19ks.
There are no sources in the BAT error circle, with a 3-sigma
upper limit of 8e-4 ct/sec.
