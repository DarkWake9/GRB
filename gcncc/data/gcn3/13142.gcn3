U.Quadri, L.Strabla, R.Girelli and A.Quadri 
report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120326A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 518626) Goad et al (GCNC 13110), with the robotic 
telescope of (IAU station 565) Bassano Bresciano 
Observatory (member of ISSP), Italy.

The observations had started 19h 58m and ended 26h 08m  after the 
GRB trigger,with our schmidt telescope D=320 mm F/D=3.1.

Weather conditions were good.

We co-added some series of 20 exposures of 120s takings for the 
whole night between 26 and 27 March 2012.

We detected clearly the presence of the optical couterpart 
(e.g. Klotz et al. GCNC 13107) that confirms the rebrightening 
mentioned by Gorosabel et al.(GCNC 13112), 
at the following position: 

RA (J2000.0) =  18 15 37.19 
DEC(J2000.0) = +69 15 35.5

The CCD unfiltered magnitude during all through the 
observations has been 18.7 (+/- 0.2)
The magnitude has nearly been constant during 
this period.

Magnitudes were estimated with the UCAC-3 
catalog and are not corrected for galactic 
dust extinction.

Lightcurve analisis is in progress, 
further observations are planed.
