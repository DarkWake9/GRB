A.J. Levan (Warwick), K. Wiersema, N.R. Tanvir (Leicester) report
on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 111008A (Saxton et al. GCN 12423)
with Gemini-South in the r-band. Observations began at 03:12 UT, 5
hours after the BAT trigger. Within the refined XRT error circle
(Beardmore GCN 12425) we locate a single object at

RA(J2000) 04:04:48.24 
DEC(J2000) -32:42:33.4

with an error of 0.5" in each axis. Preliminary photometry against
USNO-B1 suggests R~22.8.  We suggest this may be the afterglow of
GRB 111008A. Further spectroscopic observations are in progress.

We thank the Gemini staff for the rapid and efficient execution of
these observations."
