report:  
A giant flare of SGR1900+14 was detected by BeppoSAX at 7:55:12 UT of
April 18, 2001. The peak flux measured by the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, 
after background subtraction and no dead time correction, is around 15400
c/s. The flare has an approximate duration of 40 s. The 5s pulsation is
apparent.  The Wide Field Camera #1 was switched off by rate protection at
a level of 1300 c/s before the flare peak.  A BeppoSAX TOO is in
progress.
