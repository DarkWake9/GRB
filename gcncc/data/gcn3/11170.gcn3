A. De Cia, P.M. Vreeswijk and P. Jakobsson (University of
Iceland) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100901A (Immler et al., GCN 11159)
with the NOT equipped with ALFOSC in good weather conditions.
Observations were carried out in the R filter for 15 minutes,
with mean time 12.13 hours after the GRB trigger.

We measure R=17.3 for the afterglow, not corrected for Galactic
extinction, calibrated against the USNO-B1.0 1127-0027231
reference star (R=15.37) used by Andreev et al., GCN 11166 and
GCN 11168.

We acknowledge the careful assistence of the NOT staff, in
