M. Stamatikos (OSU/NASA/GSFC) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 02:13:58 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120815A (trigger=531003).  Swift will execute a delayed slew
due to Earth-limb observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location
is RA, Dec 273.955, -52.134, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 15m 49s
   Dec(J2000) = -52d 08' 02"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single pulse 
with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+40.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. Pagani (cp232 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
