D.W. Fox, S.G. Djorgovski, and S.R. Kulkarni (Caltech) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have imaged the area surrounding Source A14 of GCN 1249, a
candidate X-ray afterglow for the dark burst GRB020127, using the
Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the Keck-II telescope.  In a
summed R-band image with 45 minutes total exposure in subarcsecond
seeing on March 13.3 (UT) we detect an extended object that we suggest
is the host galaxy of this GRB.  The corresponding X-ray source A14
may in this case be identified as the likely X-ray afterglow of
GRB020127, which is therefore located at:

    RA = 08 15 01.42, Dec = +36 46 33.9 (J2000)

with an uncertainty of roughly 1".  A smoothed image of a portion of
the ESI field may be found at

In light of this proposed identification, we suggest as well that the
coincident weak radio source reported in GCN 1250 was the radio
afterglow of this GRB."
