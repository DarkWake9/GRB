S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley), E. O. Ofek (Weizmann Institute), and P. E.
Nugent (LBNL/UC Berkeley) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the location of the MAXI GRB120127A (Song et al., GCN
12901) with the Palomar 48 inch Oschin Schmidt telescope as part of the
Palomar Transient Factory.  Observations began at 3:41 UT on 28 January
2012 (~ 23.3 hours after the MAXI trigger) and cover ~ 90% of the MAXI
error localization.

By comparing sources detected in our images with the USNO-B1 catalog,
2MASS point source catalog, and the Digital Palomar Optical Sky Survey
archival images, we find no new sources within the MAXI error
localization (aside from a number of known minor planets).  The limiting
magnitude of our imaging is R >~ 19.5 mag (calculated with respect to
field stars from the USNO-B catalog).
