INTEGRAL SPI-ACS GRB team, report:

On 2011 July 8 at about 13:59:46 UT, an extremely intense, long duration 
GRB was observed by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), MESSENGER, and Swift 
(BAT) (outside the coded field of view).  We have triangulated it to the 
following 3 sigma error box:
  -----------------------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg              Dec(2000), deg
-----------------------------------------------
Center:
  170.382 (11h 21m 32s)   -50.569 (-50d 34' 09")
Corners:
  170.638 (11h 22m 33s)   -50.604 (-50d 36' 14")
  169.949 (11h 19m 48s)   -50.926 (-50d 55' 34")
  170.126 (11h 20m 30s)   -50.534 (-50d 32' 02")
  170.810 (11h 23m 14s)   -50.209 (-50d 12' 32")
-----------------------------------------------

The error box area is 489 sq. arcmin.
The maximum distance between the box corners is 0.9 deg.
This error box may be improved.
