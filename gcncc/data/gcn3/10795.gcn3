The long GRB100522A (Swift/BAT trigger #422783 ; Troja et al., GCN 10784)
was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2010-05-22 03:45:52 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a single peak starting at T0, ending
at T0+4s with a duration (T90) of about 3 seconds.
The WAM detected only the first bright peak observed by
Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et al., GCN 10788) and Fermi/GBM(McBreen et al.,
GCN 10790).
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.39 (-0.18, +0.15) x10-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+1s was 1.50 (-0.27, +0.24)
photons/cm2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from T0 to
T0+4s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.26 (-0.18, +0.21) (chi2/d.o.f = 26.8/35).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
