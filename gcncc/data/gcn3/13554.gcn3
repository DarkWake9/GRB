We observed the location of GRB 120729A (Ukwatta et al., GCN Circ.
13530) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 12:14 UT on
2012-07-29, corresponding to 78 minutes after the burst trigger.
Exposures totaling 3.1 hours were made in reasonable weather conditions.
No source was detected, with a preliminary RMS of 1.8 mJy/beam at 
850 microns.

We thank Jeff Cox and Ruud Visser for their prompt support of these 
observations.
