The very long GRB 100413A (Swift/BAT trigger #419404 ;
Holland et al., GCN 10581)

was detected by the the Suzaku Wide-band  All-sky Monitor (WAM)
which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 2010-04-13 17:33:28 UT
(=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
 lasting to T0+220s with a duration T90 of about 160 seconds.
The fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.59 (-0.83, +0.21) x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
 The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+118s was 0.38 (-0.27, +0.14)
photons/cm^2/s in the same  energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-2s to T0+213s is well fitted by a power-law with exponential
cutoff model:
  dN/dE ~  E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
  alpha       -0.59 (-1.64, +1.27), and
  Epeak       364 (-55, +98) keV (chi^2/d.o.f. = 37.9/30).

All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level,
in which the systematic uncertainties are not included.
