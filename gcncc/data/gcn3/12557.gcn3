of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short hard intense GRB 111113A
(localized by IPN: Golenetskii et al., GCN 12556)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=18613.625s UT (05:10:13.625)

The light curve consists of a single hard peak with
a total duration of ~160 ms. There is a hint of a weaker
emission starting ~200 ms before the main pulse
and extending to ~T0+500ms;
The emission is seen up to ~10 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB111113_T18613/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (7.7 ± 1.0)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.016 s,
of (9.2 ± 1.8)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.128 s)
is best fitted in the 40 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.53 (-0.16, +0.18),
and Ep = 1480(-226, +265) keV,
chi2 = 20.7/23 dof.
Also, a noticeable counts excess over this model spectrum
is observed in the 20-40 keV range.


All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
