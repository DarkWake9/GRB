Daniele Malesani, Eliana Palazzi, and Simone Scaringi report:

We obtained an R-band image of the afterglow of GRB 100418A (Marshall et 
al., GCN 10612; Filgas et al., GCN 10617) with the X-shooter acquisition 
camera 34.63 hr after the GRB. The afterglow has decayed by 1.11+-0.03 
mag since our previous observation taken 8.37 hr after the GRB 
(Antonelli et al., GCN 10620).

We encourage further observations at all wavelengths of this interesting 
event. We acknowledge support from the ESO staff at Paranal, in 
particular Alvaro Alvarez, Claudia Cid, and Fernando Selman.
