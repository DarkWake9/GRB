We observed GRB111107A (GCN12534) with the Australian Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) on Nov 07 at 12 UT (~11 hours after the GRB
trigger). At 9GHz there is no sign of any emission from the GRB above
a 3ó limit of 200uJy. At 5.5GHz there appears to be a 4ó source at
300+/-40uJy at the UVOT location of the GRB (GCN 12538). In both cases
the measurement of the possible GRB flux is complicated by the
presence of one or more confusing radio sources in the field of view.
Further observations are planned. We thank the observatory staff for
scheduling and supporting these observations.
