J. Kelemen,(Konkoly Obs.)
on behalf of the GRB OT observing program at the Konkoly Observatory.

We observed the field of GRB 110402A using the enhanced Swift-XRT position
A.P. Beardmore et al. (GCN 11860) with a 60/90 cm Schmidt telescope located at
the Mountain Station of the Konkoly Observatory. Within the XRT error circle
we found an OT candidate at the position:

RA(2000) 13h 09m 36.64s
Dec(2000) +61d 15' 09.7" 

With an uncertainty of 0.15 arcsec.

For the photometry of the source on the coadded frames (total exp time 900
sec) nearby stars of the UCAC3 catalogue were used.

Time from 
the trigger    magnitude       Band

Further observations planned.
