TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  11250
SUBJECT: GRB100906A: non-detection at 15GHz
DATE:    10/09/07 10:08:45 GMT
FROM:    Guy Pooley at MRAO, Cambridge, UK  <ggp1@cam.ac.uk>

The AMI Large Array (Cambridge, UK) was used to observe the field
of GRB 100906A (Markwardt et al, GCN11227) in the band 13.5 to 17.2 GHz
from 2010 Sep 06 23h31m to Sept 07 03h35m (starting 9h42m after the
trigger). The weather conditions were very poor and the noise levels
consequently high; no detection of GRB 100906A was made, with a formal
flux density at the UVOT position from GCN11227 of 380 microJy 
and an rms noise of 136 microJy.

This message is quotable in publications.
