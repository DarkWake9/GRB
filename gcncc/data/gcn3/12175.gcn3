Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110719A (trigger #457553)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 12173).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 24.570, 34.578 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 38m 16.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +34d 34' 39.0" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 30%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED-like peak starting at ~T-5 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and returning to background around T+95 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 41.0 +- 7.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.0 to T+42.9 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.63 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.8 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.02 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
