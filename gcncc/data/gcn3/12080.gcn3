B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/IASFPA), J. Cummings (GSFC/UMBC), report on 
behalf of the Swift Team.

Swift-XRT performed further observations on the afterglow candidate 
announced in Sbarufatti et al. (GCN 12067). The source has faded with 
respect to the initial observation (1.2E-2 counts/s), and has dropped 
below the threshold for detection. The latest observations contain a 20 
ks exposure, corresponding to a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.3E-3 counts/s, 
confirming that the source was X-ray the afterglow of GRB 110604A.
