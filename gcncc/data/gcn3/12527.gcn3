D. Denisenko (IKI, Moscow), V. Gerke and S. Korotkiy (Ka-Dar
observatory, Russia) report:

Position of GRB 111103B (Grupe et al., GCN 12519; Barthelmy et al.,
GCN 12524; Goad et al., GCN 12525) was observed by 40-cm Djigit
telescope of Ka-Dar observatory's TAU station (Nizhniy Arkhyz,
Karachay-Cherkessia) equipped with SBIG STL-11K CCD from 15:35 UT to
16:04 UT on 2011 Nov. 03 (4.6-5.1 hr after the burst trigger). In
total, 10 unfiltered 120-sec exposures were taken.

There are no new sources detected in the error box of GRB 111103B on
the combined image, as compared to Red DSS plate of similar depth. The
limiting magnitude of the combined image (SNR=3) is R~20.2. The sum of
nine best frames (effective exposure of 18 minutes centered at 15:50
UT) is available at http://pics.livejournal.com/bigdenru/pic/000ak676/
(5'x5' crop).

We have also measured the light curve of the nearby star G 20-10 =
2MASS 17424702+0136326 (J=11.060+/-0.023, K=10.232+/-0.023) to check
for its variability. The star has remained constant within 0.01 mag
during our 0.5 hr observations. It is far from saturation with no more
than 13000 ADU on the individual images.
