GRB020410: second BeppoSAX NFI observation

On Apr. 12 at 17:00 U.T. a second BeppoSAX NFI observation has been
started, 54.3 hours after the burst. The unknown source previously reported is
detected again and its flux is decreased about a factor 2. This fact makes
more probable the connection with the WFC transient of April the 10th
whose nature is however still to be understood. Further analysis are in
progress.
