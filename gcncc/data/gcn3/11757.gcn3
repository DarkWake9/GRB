Using the data set from T-120 to T+293 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110223B (trigger #446677)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 11754).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 150.340, -68.329 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 01m 21.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -68d 19' 44.3" 
with an uncertainty of 2.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows the burst start with a small peak
at ~T-45 sec, a slightly larger peak at ~T+2 sec out to ~T+20 sec, with on-going
low-level emission out to ~T+150 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 54.0 +- 8.5 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-45 to T+20 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.65 +- 0.21.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.1 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.99 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
