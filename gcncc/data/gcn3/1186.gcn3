FROM:    Nestor Mirabal at Columbia U.  <abulafia@astro.columbia.edu>

N. Mirabal & J. P. Halpern (Columbia) report on behalf of the
MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team:

"We obtained R-band images on the MDM 1.3m for 2 hours on each
of the following nights, covering the positions of all ten
Chandra X-ray sources listed by Ricker et al. (GCN #1185):

Dec. 6.18
Dec. 7.24
Dec. 9.27

We detect constant optical counterparts of nine of the ten
sources.  The source CXOU J030458.7+034702 is not detected
in any of our images to an approximate limiting magnitude
R > 23.  Deeper optical images of this location would be
useful.

This message may be cited."
