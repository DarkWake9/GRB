Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of SGR Swift J1834.9-0846 (BAT trigger #501752)
(Hoversten, et al., GCN Circ. 12316).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 278.710, -8.770 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 34m 50.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -08d 46' 11.8" 
with an uncertainty of 3.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike with a width of ~0.016 sec
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.012 +- 0.001 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.000 to T+0.012 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
3.15 +- 0.63.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.8 +- 1.2 x 10^-9 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.49 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.34 +- 0.18 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
