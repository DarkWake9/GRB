Klotz A. (CESR-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC),
Boer M. (OHP-OAMP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of Swift J185003.2-005627 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 456014, Beardmore et al. 2011 GCNC 12083) with the
TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm) located at the European Southern
Observatory, La Silla observatory, Chile.

The observations started 53.6s after the GRB trigger
(10.2s after the notice), i.e 80s before the
first optical observation reported from TAROT Calern
(see Klotz et al. 2011 GCNC 12084).
The elevation of the field increased from 10 degrees above
horizon and weather conditions were good.

The first image is trailed with a duration of 60.0s
(see the description in Klotz et al., 2006, A&A 451, L39).
We do not detect any OT with a limiting magnitude of:
t0+53.6s to t0+113.6s : R > 15.4
