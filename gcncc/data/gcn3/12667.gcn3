report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 09:23:07 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111212A (trigger=509543).  Swift could not slew immediately
to the burst due to an observing constraint. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 310.404, -68.617 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 20h 41m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = -68d 37' 01"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a weak emission
with a duration of at least 20 sec, but a more detailed description 
will require the ground-linked data.  The peak count rate
was ~500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until T0+47.6
minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. A. Swenson (cswenson AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
