Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), Loris Magnani
(UGA), and Chris De Pree (Agnes Scott College) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100413A (Holland et al., GCN 10581) with the
0.9m SARA-North telescope at KPNO beginning at 06:57 UT on April 14, 2010
(13.4 hours after the trigger) at high airmass and continuing for 40
minutes.  At the location of the enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al.,
GCN 10584) we do not detect any new sources in stacked I-band images down
to a limiting magnitude of I ~ 19 (as compared to the USNO B1.0 catalog). 
No further observations are planned.
