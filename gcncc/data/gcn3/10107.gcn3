Nysewander report:

Skynet continued to observe the afterglow (Grupe et al., GCN 10097) of GRB 
091029 (Grupe et al., GCN 10097) with three of the 16" PROMPT telescopes at 
CTIO in BRI.

After peaking in brightness 5 - 6 minutes after the trigger (LaCluyze et 
al., GCN 10099) the afterglow continued to fade as a power-law of index 
approximately -0.5 (LaCluyze et al., GCN 10099) until at least 4.7 hours 
after the trigger.

At 4.7 hours after the trigger, the afterglow's magnitude was I = 18.52 +/- 
0.06 (statistical) +/- 0.41 (systematic; calibrated to 125 USNO B1 stars).

Skynet's most recent BRI light curve, calibrated to USNO B1 stars, can be
