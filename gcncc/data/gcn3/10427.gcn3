J. P. Norris (U. Denver), S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC), 
N. Gehrels (GSFC), and D. Grupe (PSU) report:
 
Temporal analysis of BAT data for GRB 100213A suggests
that the burst is likely a member of the short, hard class:

Structures in the burst's most intense pulse complex
are as short as ~ 10-25 ms, typical of most short bursts.

Spectral lag analysis of this most intense pulse complex
indicate a lag between BAT channels 4 (100-350 keV) and
2 (25-50 keV) of ~ 5 ms +- 15 ms.  For the whole event,
the lag between these same channels is ~ 15 ms +- 15 ms.

A Bayesian Block analysis reveals no significant emission
after the T90 duration of 2.4 s (reported in GCN circ. 10424,
Barthelmy et al.) for ~ 400 s following the BAT trigger time.
This is inconsistent only at the 2-sigma level with the finding
in Circ 10424 that there was "low level emission out to T+40 sec",
and we further note that this emission is only in the 15-25 keV band.
