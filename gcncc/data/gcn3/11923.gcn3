J.S. Deng, C. Wu, X. H. Han on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB110411A ( Grope et al., GCN 11918) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at  19:35:32 (UT), 81 sec after 
the burst. A series of White and R-band images were obtained. 
With the combination of all R-band images of 37*60 sec 
exposure time, we detected an new source nearby the 
errorbox  of X-ray counterpart ( Goad et al., GCN 11920 ).

The coordinates of new source are:

Ra:    19:25:45.65 
Dec:   67:42:39.1
Epoch: J2000

The uncertainty of the coordinates is about 1 arc. 

The brightness of this source is estimated to be about 
21 +/- 0.2 mag in the R band, at the mean time of 38 min 
after the burst, comparing to an USNO B1.0 R2 reference star, 
of which the coordinates are 
19:25:52.432 +67:43:44.07 J2000 R2=16.18mag.

We proposed that the new source be the optical 
counterpart of GRB 110411A.
