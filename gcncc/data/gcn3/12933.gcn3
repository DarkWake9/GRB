E. A. Hoversten (PSU) and E. Sonbas (NASA/GSFC/Adiyaman Univ.) report on behalf of the Swift team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 2885 seconds after the BAT trigger. The source identified by 
Guidorzi et al. (GCN Circ. 12932) is detected in the rapidly available 
2.7'x2.7' sub-image at

RA(J2000) =	02:52:24.06 = 43.10025
DEC(J2000) = -18:01:14.1 = -18.02057

with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.76 arc sec. This position is 5.21
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
18.31 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.15. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.03.
