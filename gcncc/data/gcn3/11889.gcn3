V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (SAI MSU) on behalf of 
larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed the field of GRB 110402A  (Ukwatta et al. GCN 11857) with Shajn 
telescope of CrAO  observatory  on Apr. 3 between (UT) 18:41 and 19:59 under 
seeing of about 2.6 arsces. We took several frames with exposure of 60s in 
R-band. On a stacked image we detected the optical counterpart (Mundell et 
al. GCN 11858, Leloudas et al. GCN 11859). The counterpart has coordinates 
(J2000) RA = 13h 09m 36.63s, Dec = +61d 15' 09.5'' with uncertainty of 0.1" 
in both coordinates which are fully compatible with initial counterpart 
coordinates (Mundell et al. GCN 11858). The photometry is based on the USNO 
B1.0 star 1512-0199231 (13 09 43.16 +61 14 38.5) assuming R=16.71.
