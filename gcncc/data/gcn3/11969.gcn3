A. A. Breeveld (MSSL-UCL) and V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 110422A
822 s after the BAT trigger (Mangano et al., GCN Circ. 11957).
An optical afterglow consistent with the optical position found by 
Klunko et al. (GCN 11958) and others is found in the UVOT, and is 
clearly fading. It is detected in initial exposures in both white and 
b, and also in v and u when the initial exposures are summed up.
Preliminary magnitudes and 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT 
photometric system (Poole et al. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 627) for the first 
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

The values quoted above are not corrected for the Galactic extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.03 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
