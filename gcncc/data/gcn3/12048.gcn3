Y. Yatsu, K.Kawakami, Y. Aoki, K. Tokoyoda, M. Hayashi, S. Song,
R. Usui, and N. Kawai (Tokyo Tech)  report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We observed GRB110530A (D'Avanzo et al, GCN12046)
with the optical three color (g, Rc, and Ic) CCD camera attached
to the MITSuME 50 cm telescope of Akeno Observatory, Yamanashi, Japan.
The follow-up observation was started at 15:31:02, ~2min after the BAT trigger.
And we detected a very faint object within the XRT error circle in R-band.
The measured R-band magnitude is shown below.
