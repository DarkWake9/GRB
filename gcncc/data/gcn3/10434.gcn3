Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100219A (trigger #412982)
(Rowlinson, et al., GCN Circ. 10430).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 154.202, -12.555 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  10h 16m 48.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = -12d 33' 19.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 71%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a roughly triangular shaped peak
starting at ~T-10sec, peaking at ~T+30 sec, and ending at ~T+50 sec
(possibly out to ~T+100 sec).  T90 (15-350 keV) is 18.8 +- 5.0 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+19 to T+45 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.7 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+31.89 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
