Kevin Hurley announces the opening of the 3rd Interplanetary Network
web site at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/index.html.  This site
presently has four parts.

1. A bibliography of over 3000 publications on gamma-ray bursts,

2. IPN data on all bursts triangulated up to February 1998,

3. A master list showing which spacecraft observed which bursts,

4. Preliminary IPN data on the latest bursts observed.




[GCN Operator's Note:  This circular is not about a specific burst,
but it is within the scope of the GCN Circulars.  This IPN information
will be of interest to the burst follow-up community.]
