Adria C. Updike (Dickinson College), Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University), Peter A. Milne (Steward Observatory) and G. Grant Williams
(MMT Observatory) report:

We observed the field of GRB 111225A (Siegel et al., GCN 12720) with the
0.6m Super-LOTIS telescope located at Kitt Peak National Observatory under
good conditions and airmass of 1.1.  Observations began 49 seconds after
the trigger.  The OT (Siegel et al. GCN 12720, Klotz et al. GCN 12722) is
marginally detected in 300 seconds of stacked images (with a midtime of
480 seconds after the trigger) with an R-band magnitude of 19.9 +/- 0.2
(on comparison to the USNO B1.0 catalog).  Observations are continuing.
