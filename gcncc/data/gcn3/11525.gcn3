At 21:26:17 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 110106B (trigger=441676).  There was a 3.8 minute delayed slew. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 134.196, +46.998 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  08h 56m 47s
   Dec(J2000) = +46d 59' 52"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows several peaks
with a total duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 21:31:44.2 UT, 327.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 134.15458, 47.00194 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 08h 56m 37.10s
   Dec(J2000) = +47d 00' 07.0"
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 102 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source is
fading at the present time. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 2.37
x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 332 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has
been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of
the XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated
on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically
complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.03. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is B. Sbarufatti (boris.sbarufatti AT brera.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
