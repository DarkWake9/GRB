The long GRB 101023A, (Swift/BAT trigger=436981:
Saxton, et al., GCN 11363; Stamatikos et.al, GCN 11367)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=82264.703s UT (22:51:04.703)

The burst light curve started, at ~T0-65s, with a weak
initial pulse, followed by a much brighter and harder
emission episode, peaked at ~T0+5s.
The total duration of the burst is ~100 s.
The emission is seen up to 2 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB101023_T82264/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (6.6 ± 0.5)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+4.096s,
of (7.1 ± 0.5)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of major part of the burst
(from T0 to T0+29.952 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -1.07 (-0.07, +0.08),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.5 (-0.3, +0.7),
the peak energy Ep = 200(-16, +17) keV (chi2 = 73/57 dof).

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+0.256 to T0+6.400 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 2 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.84 (-0.07, +0.08),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.8 (-0.4, +0.2),
the peak energy Ep = 239(-17, +18) keV (chi2 = 56/57 dof).

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
