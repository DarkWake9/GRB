GRB110825A (=Fermi GBM trigger 335932012) was observed by AGILE MCAL
(outside the coded field of view of SuperAGILE), Fermi GBM, MESSENGER
GRNS, Odyssey HEND, Suzaku WAM, and Swift BAT (outside the coded field 
of view).  We have triangulated it to a preliminary, 3 sigma error
box whose area is 252 square arcminutes and whose coordinates are:

           RA                               DEC                         

CENTER:   44.896 o= 2 h 59 m 35.1 s      15.407 o= 15 o 24' 25"
CORNERS:  45.160 o= 3 h 00 m 38.3 s      14.528 o= 14 o 31' 39"          
          44.959 o= 2 h 59 m 50.1 s      15.336 o= 15 o 20' 11"           
          44.834 o= 2 h 59 m 20.1 s      15.478 o= 15 o 28' 42"         
          44.595 o= 2 h 58 m 22.7 s      16.428 o= 16 o 25' 40"

This preliminary error box has been posted at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/110825A;
it can be improved.

A Swift ToO has been carried out, and the results of that observation,
as well as the details of the burst, will be reported in forthcoming
GCN Circulars.
