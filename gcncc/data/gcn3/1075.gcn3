At 12:21:07.75 UTC (44467.75 s UT) on 29 June, the HETE FREGATE and 
WXM instruments detected and localized a bright GRB. The coordinates 
(J2000) of the 29 June burst are:

R.A. = 248.158 deg. (16h32m38s.3)

Dec. =  -18.723 deg. (-18o43'24")

The error circle for this localization is 15 arcmin in radius.

The burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was ~20 s, with two peaks 
separated by ~12 s. A total of ~11600 counts above background were 
detected during that interval, corresponding to a fluence of ~2 x 
10-6 ergs cm-2 . The peak flux was >3 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie >10 x 
Crab flux).


Follow-up observations of this transient are encouraged.

Additional information on this burst detection (including light 
curves), as well as for the HETE mission, will be available at:
