The wide field "Pi of the Sky South" apparatus, installed in the private
observatory of Alain Maury in San Pedro de Atacama
(http://grb.fuw.edu.pl/pi/index.html#spda_site.htm) observed the position
of GRB 111209A ( SWIFT trigger #590336 ).
Three 10s images of this field have been taken at 01:59:03 - 01:59:51 UT
( 5 hours 13 min 5 sec before the first BAT alert ). No new object can be
  seen within the error box and the limit on 3 coadded images is 12.7 mag.
After receiving the trigger from SWIFT, the field was observed 480 seconds
after the GRB. The field has been observed in time period from 7:20:09 to
7:44:25 UT, no new object brighter than 10.2 mag was observed on 10s 
images. The limit on 20 coadded images is 10.7 mag.
Limits are based on the reference star magnitudo in V filter.

We acknowladge great support received from Alain Maury at SPdA Observatory.
