"Comparison of optical R-band observations of the error box of 
GRB980326 (IAUC 6851) taken at the AAT at Mar 27.42 UT (480s), 
the CTIO 4m-telescope at Mar 28.04 UT (600s) and the 
ESO 3.5m NTT at Mar 28.01 UT (ESO1, 600s) and Mar 28.17 UT 
(ESO2, 600s) shows a clearly variable object located at RA 08:36:34.28, 
Decl -18:51:23.9 (J2000).  Differential photometry with respect
to three local stars shows a decrease between the AAT and ESO1 
of 1.2(1) mag, AAT and CTIO of 1.6(1) mag and AAT and ESO2 of 1.7(1) mag. 
The three local standards have coordinate end-figures: 1) 36:35.41, 51:41.6; 
2) 36:31.00, 51:17.3; 3) 36:34.03, 50:53.2.  Their R-band magnitudes are: 
1) 18.4(1); 2) 21.7(1); 3) 20.3(1), as determined with respect to 
Landolt SA 98, no. 626, 624, 634, 590.  At the time of the AAT observation 
(Mar. 27.42 UT) the R-band magnitude of the variable was R=21.7, 
equal to that of comparison star 2.
