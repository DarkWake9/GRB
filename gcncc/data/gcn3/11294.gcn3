V. Mangano (INAF-IASFPA), W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC),
J. R. Cummings (NASA/UMBC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC),
E. A. Hoversten (PSU), C. B. Markwardt (NASA/GSFC) and
B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/IASFPA) report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 03:58:08 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 100924A (trigger=434843).  Swift did not slew to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 0.671, +7.015 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 00h 02m 41s
   Dec(J2000) = +07d 00' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a multi-peaked
structure with a duration of about 90 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~5457 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 13:21 UT on 2010 September 25. There will thus be no XRT
or UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is V. Mangano (vanessa AT ifc.inaf.it). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
