K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, and E. Montanari,
C. Guidorzi, and F. Frontera, on behalf of the Beppo-SAX GRBM
team, report:

Ulysses and the BeppoSAX GRBM observed GRB010629 (HETE-II observation
in GCN 1075).  As observed by Ulysses, its duration was approx.
20 s, its 25-100 keV fluence was approx. 9 x 10^-5 erg/cm^2,
and its peak flux over 0.5 s was 1.4 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2 s. 

Triangulation gives an annulus centered at RA(2000),
Decl. (2000) = 198.208 deg., -37.333 deg., with radius 47.083 +/-
0.130 deg.  (3 sigma).  One circle of the annulus roughly bisects the
HETE-II error circle with intersection points RA(2000), Decl(2000)=

16 h 33 m 12 s, -18 o 55' 58" and
16 h 32 m 02 s, -18 o 31' 06"

The other circle of the annulus lies slightly outside the error 
circle, but comes close to grazing it at RA(2000), Decl(2000)=

16 h 31 m 43 s, -18 o 50' 07" .

Thus the combined HETE/IPN error region has a total area
of about 350 sq. arcmin., or approximately one-half that 
of the HETE error circle alone.

This annulus may be improved somewhat.
