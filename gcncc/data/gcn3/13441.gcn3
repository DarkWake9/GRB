report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of GRB 120711A (Gotz et al. GCN 12434;
Lacluyze et al. GCN 12430) using the GMOS-S spectrograph on Gemini-South.

Observations began at 2012-7-11 10:08 UT, about 7.5 hr post-burst.
The data were obtained at high air-mass and on the boundary of twilight,
so the signal-to-noise is rather poor.  Nevertheless,
in the spectrum we identify lines of MgII (2797/2804A) and
FeII (2374/2383/2587/2600A) at a common redshift of z=1.405.

This therefore provides a robust lower-limit to the redshift of the GRB.
Furthermore, given the lack of other absorption features, in particular
any matching a redshift z~3 (Elliott et al. GCN 13438), we tentatively
identify z=1.405 as the most likely GRB redshift.
