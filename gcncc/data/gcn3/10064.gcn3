Markku Nissinen (Taurus Hill Observatory) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus
Hill Observatory) report:

We used Global-rent-a-scope GRAS004 Epsilon 250 telescope with ST-8XE CCD 
at RAS Observatory Mayhill H06 (New Mexico, USA) for follow-up observations
of GRB091024 (D.Palmer et al. , GCN 10062). The observations were started 
on October 24, at 09:44 UTC (48 min after the burst) and stopped on October, 
at 09:58 UTC. One unfiltered 120 seconds image and one unfiltered 600 seconds image 
were taken. We detected a very dim uncatalogued optical afterglow object at the position
of RA 22h 36min 59s.68 and DEC +56o 53' 22".6   with respect to POSSII F
(J2000) which is in good correlation with Carole Mundell et al. observation 
(GCN 10063). Upper limit for our observations is >18.7 mag. Quoted upper 
limit has been derived using POSSII F and USNO-B1.0 field stars as reference.
