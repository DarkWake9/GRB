Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100719A (trigger #429357)
(Margutti, et al., GCN Circ. 10963).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 112.319, -5.857 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 29m 16.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = -05d 51' 24.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 57%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a few overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-5 sec, peaking at ~T+2 sec, and ending at ~T+80 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 36.0 +- 9.2 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.9 to T+35.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.69 +- 0.25.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.3 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+2.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
