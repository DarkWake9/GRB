D. Frederiks and D. Svinkin on behalf of the Konus-Wind team,
report:

1. The further analysis of the Konus-Wind detection (GCN 11869)
of GRB 110402A (GCN 11857, 11866) confirms the zero spectral
lag in the initial hard pulse reported with the Swift-BAT data
(Barthelmy and Norris, GCN 11870).
The following lag values between the Konus-Wind light curves
are obtained:
-------------------------------------------------------------
LC1(keV)     LC2(keV)   Search Interval(s) Scale   Lag(ms)
-------------------------------------------------------------
G2(70-300)   G1(18-70)   -0.512:+0.320     8 ms   +3.5 ± 12.5
G3(300-1160) G1(18-70)   -0.512:+0.280     8 ms   +3.2 ± 12.3
G3(300-1160) G2(70-300)  -0.340:+0.320     4 ms   -0.3 ± 4.8
-------------------------------------------------------------
The errors are given on 1 sigma level.

2. The total burst fluence S=(1.6 ± 0.5)x10-5 erg/cm2 reported
in GCN 11869 is divided between the hard initial pulse and
the softer extended emission as follows:
T0(-0.512 : +2.816) -> S1=(5.7 ± 1.9)x10-6 erg/cm2 (initial pulse)
T0(2.816 : +65.792) -> S2=(9.9 ± 2.9)x10-6 erg/cm2 (extended emission)

The K-W spectrum of the latter part (measured from T0+8.448s
to T0+65.792s) can be fitted in the 20-5000 keV range
by the simple power law function with the index of (1.81 ± 0.13),
chi2 = 93.4/78

The errors are given on 90% confidence level.

All times are given relative to K-W T0=781.989s UT.
