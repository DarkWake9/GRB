FROM:    Kim Page at U.of Leicester  <kpa@star.le.ac.uk>

K.L. Page and P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT 
team:

Using promptly downlinked data we find an X-ray source with an enhanced 
position: RA,Dec = 249.3547, -23.9618 (degrees) which is equivalent to:

RA  (J2000.0) = 16 37 25.13
DEC (J2000.0) = -23 57 42.4

with an uncertainty of 3.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This location 
is 67.6 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, inside the BAT error 
circle. It is not yet possible to determine whether the source is fading.
