RE:    BATSE on-board trigger changes

The BATSE on-board transient event trigger energy range was changed
from channels 2+3 (~50-300 keV) to channels 3+4 (>100 keV) on 19 May,
1998 14:39:54 UT.  The revised trigger definition will be enabled for
the next several months to increase the chance of detecting Terrestrial
Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs).  The higher trigger energy range will also
help to decrease the number of Solar Flare events.  This triggering 
change has been enabled previously and it was found that there is only 
a small decrease in the sensitivity to classical GRBs.
