GRB020322: BeppoSAX/NFI Observations

A BeppoSAX TOO observation of GB020322 has started about 7.5
hours after the GRB.
A preliminary analysis of Quick Look data of MECS(1.6-10 keV) image in the
first orbit shows a relatively bright unknown source well inside the WFC
error circle.

The position is:

RA = 270.206
Delta = 81.103

The error radius is 1.5 arcminutes.
