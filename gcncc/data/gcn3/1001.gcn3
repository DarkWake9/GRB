We have observed the error box of GRB010220 (GCN 953) with the 0.84m
telescope of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional at San Pedro Martir
(Mexico) equipped with the SITE CCD on 22 Feb at 3:00 UT (28.15 hours
after the burst).
We obtained three 120sec exposures in the R band and 8 120sec exposures
in the
B band.

No obvious counterpart has been detected and no sources lay at the
position of the radio source reported by Berger et al. (GCN 958). The
position however is very close to a bright star that may hidden any
faint object.

By unsaturated stars common to the USNO-A2.0 we estimate the 3-sigma B
and R upper limits at ~23.
