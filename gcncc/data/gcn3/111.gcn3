"The Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) onboard BeppoSAX has detected bursts
from a direction consistent with the new Soft Gamma-ray Repeater
SGR1627-41 (Kouveliotou et al., GCN #107 and IAUC 6944). 
Two events were triggered on June 17.90091 (consistent with BATSE 
trigger n. 6834) and 18.15556.
The duration of the events is about 90 and 40 milliseconds respectively.
The spectral index, assuming a power law function, is (3.0+/-0.3) and
(2.5+/-0.3) respectively in the 40-700 keV energy band.  These detections
are in agreement with those reported by BATSE and with the harder energy
range of the GRBM.
Data analysis is in progress to find out other bursts from the same source."
