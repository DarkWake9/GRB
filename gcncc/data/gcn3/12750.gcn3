D. Xu (WIS/NAOC),  J. McCormac (Queen's Univ. Belfast), and P.
Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 111228A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 12737) with
the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the AFOSC
optical camera. A 600s R-band image was taken with mean time 01:32 UT
on 2011-12-29 (9.8 hr after the burst trigger).

We clearly detected the afterglow (Ukwatta et al., GCN 12737; Xin et
al., GCN 12738; Klotz et al., GCN 12742) at a magnitude R = 19.01 +/-
0.05, calibrated with the USNO-B1 1083-0199833 star (R2 = 17.28 mag;
also used by Klotz et al., GCN 12746 and Nascimbeni et al., GCN
12748).

Further observations are ongoing.
