We observed the  Swift GRB 110213A (D'Elia et al., GCN 11705)  with AZT-33IK 
telescope of Sayan observatory (Mondy) starting Feb.13  (UT) 11:26.
In a few first images of exposure 60 s we clearly detect the UVOT afterglow 
with a preliminary brightness estimation R ~ 18.0 at 0.2566 days after 
burst.
The photometry is based on USNO-B1 field stars.

Observation is continuing.
