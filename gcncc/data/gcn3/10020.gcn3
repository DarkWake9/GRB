Aquib Moin (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy / Australia Telescope
National Facility), Dale A. Frail (National Radio Astronomy
Observatory), Steven Tingay (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy),
Jean-Pierre Macquart (Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy) report:

We observed the UVOT-enhanced XRT position (GCN 9936) of the Fermi
LAT/GBM burst GRB090926a (GCN 9933, 9972) at 5.5 GHz with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between 05:00:00 UT and 10:00:00 UT on
October 01, 2009. The ATCA was in its most compact configuration giving
a synthesized beam of 138 x 78 arcsec.

We did not detect a radio source at the XRT position of the GRB090926a
(GCN 9936). The radio flux density at the GRB position found out to be
-0.271 ± 0.727 mJy/beam.

No further observations are planned.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra
telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope
which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a
National Facility managed by CSIRO.
