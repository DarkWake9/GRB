Ondrejov,
report:

We have observed the entire error box of GRB020124 (HETE trigger 1896)
with the
Wide Field Camera (f=109mm, 1:1.7) of the BART robotic telescope. 38
unfiltered
optical CCD images with the FOV of 7.2 x 4.8 deg each have been
obtained  between
January 24.91365 and 24.99903 UT (11.5  - 13.5 hours after trigger).

No new objects down to magnitude of 15.0 were found in the GRB error box
in
comparison with the GSC catalogue.

This is the first time when the BART robotic telescope has sussesfully
responded
to the HETE GRB trigger without any human intervention. The observation
delay
was caused by waiting for the night and for good weather conditions.
