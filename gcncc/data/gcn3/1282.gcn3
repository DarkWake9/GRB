 We have observed the field of GRB020317 (= H1959 ) with the KISO
observatory 1.05m schmidt telescope at 2002 March 18. All images
(R-band) were taken with the 2kx2k CCD camera ( 50' x 50' field of
view). These images cover with the whole HETE-2 error circle reported
in GCN Notice (HETE Ground Analysis seq_num: 5).

Our data;
Date  Time (UT)     Exposure   Limiting mag.(R, SN=3)  seeing size
03-18 12:43 - 12:58 300sec x 3 20.8  5.0"
03-18 17:19 - 17:55 300sec x 6 18.1  7.5" (Bad weather condition)

# Limiting magnitude was estimated by comparison with
# U0975_06481732(10:23:25,+12:42:05,R(USNO)=16.1).

 We detected six point sources which are not in DSS-2 image. Two
sources were identified with minor planets using Minor Planet Checker
: http://scully.harvard.edu/~cgi/CheckMP. Four souces are not
identified. Because of the bad weather condition, we cannot find
their time variability.

Coordinates of these sources are:

   RA(J2000) DEC(J2000) mag.(R)
1  10:24:25  +12:51:55  18.0   <= minorr planet
2  10:24:09  +12:48:33  17.3   <= minorr planet
3  10:23:10  +12:33:17  19.6
4  10:22:40  +12:32:02  18.5
5  10:22:39  +12:44:02  19.0
6  10:22:20  +12:36:55  19.1

Astrometric uncertainties are 1 aresec, and photmetric uncertainties
are 0.1 mag. for 19 mag. objects.
