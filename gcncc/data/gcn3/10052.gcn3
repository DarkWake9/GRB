MASTER II robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, 2x400 
mm, 8 square degrees, 2x16Mpx Apogee CCD) located
at Kislovodsk  was pointed to the  GRB 091020 (Racusin et al., GCN 10048) 
by internet   3422 s after the GRB time. The 
large delay  was caused with   technical problems on site.

We see bright optical counterpart (~17.5 mag) on the firrst images at UVOT 
position.

We have 130  images with 180 sec synchronous exposition each and 19.5 
magnitude limit during ~4 hours in two polarization.

The power low decay with alpha ~= 1.3 during  2.5 hours is observed. 
This is the preliminary result.
The reduction is continued.
