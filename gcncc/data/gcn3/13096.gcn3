Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120324A (trigger #518507)
(Zhang, et al., GCN Circ. 13090).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 291.081, 24.140 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 24m 19.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +24d 08' 23.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 82%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows many overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-190 sec with a weak precursor peak, the main peak at ~T+33 sec, and
ending at ~T+180 sec (and possible as long as ~T+330 sec at the 2-sigma level).
T90 (15-350 keV) is 118 +- 10 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-150.5 to T+142.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.04.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.01 +- 0.03 x 10^-5 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+33.68 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 5.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
