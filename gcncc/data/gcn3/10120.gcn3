J.A. Kennea, C. Pagani, E.A. Hoversten (PSU), P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U.
Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using 289 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT images, we find a
possible afterglow candidate with an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources to
the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 72.61610, -72.51970 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000):  04 50 27.87
Dec (J2000): -72 31 10.9

with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence), 72 arcseconds
from the BAT position reported by Hoversten et al. (GCN #10117).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

Currently we cannot confirm any fading in this afterglow candidate.
Observations are on-going.
