TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  11103
SUBJECT: GRB 100816A: ROTSE-III Optical Limits
DATE:    10/08/16 01:42:21 GMT
FROM:    Shashi Bhushan Pandey at ROTSE  <shaship@umich.edu>

S. B. Pandey (U Mich), report on behalf of the ROTSE collaboration:

ROTSE-IIIc, located at the H.E.S.S. site at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia,
responded to GRB 100816A, possibly a short duration burst, (Swift trigger
431764; Oates, S. R., GCN 11102), producing images beginning 6.8 s after
the GCN notice time. An automated response took the first image at
01:00:05.7 UT, 1334.3 s after the burst, under fair conditions. We took 10
5-sec, 10 20-sec and 10 60-sec exposures. These unfiltered images are
calibrated relative to USNO A2.0 (R). Imaging is on going.

Comparison to the DSS (second epoch) reveals no new sources within the
3-sigma Swift/BAT error circle or the XRT error circle. Individual images
have limiting magnitudes ranging from 16.2-17.9; we set the following
specific limits.
