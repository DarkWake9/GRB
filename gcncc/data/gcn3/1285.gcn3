GRB020321: BeppoSAX/NFI Observations

A BeppoSAX TOO observation of GB020321 has started about 6
hours after the GRB.
A preliminary analysis of MECS(1.6-10 keV) image of the first orbits shows
a possible unknown source in the WFC error circle. The object, very faint,
seems to be fading.

The position is:

RA = 242.76
Delta = -83.70

The error radius is 2 arcminutes.

A more refined off-line analysys is required to confirm and improve the
detection.
