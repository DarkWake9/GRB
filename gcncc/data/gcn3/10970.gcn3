F. Olivares E., J. Greiner, P. Afonso (all MPE Garching), and S. Klose 
(TLS Tautenburg), report on behalf of the GROND team:

The afterglow candidate reported by Olivares et al. (GCN 10969) is clearly 
fading. Between mid-times of 00:49 UT and 01:14 UT the object faded by 1.3 
magnitudes, corresponding to a power-law decay index of about 0.7. We 
therefore confirm this object to be the afterglow of GRB 100724A.
