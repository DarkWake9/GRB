E. A. Hoversten (PSU) reports on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 120215A
110 s after the BAT trigger (Hoversten et al., GCN Circ. 12954).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 12957) is detected in the initial UVOT  
exposures.
The optical source reported by LaCluyze et al. (GCN Circ. 12956) was not
seen in the first orbit of observations, however our upper limits are  
higher than
their detections. Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT
photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373)  
for the first
finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:

The magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic  
extinction
due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.08 in the direction of the burst
(Schlegel et al. 1998).
