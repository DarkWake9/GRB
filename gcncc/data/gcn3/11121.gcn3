D. Malesani, J.P.U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), D. Xu (Weizmann Inst.), P. 
Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), L. Buchhave, T. Hansen (NBI), report on behalf of a 
larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 100814A (Schaefer et al., GCN 
11086; Beardmore et al., GCN 11087) with the NOT equipped with ALFOSC. 
Observations were carried out in the R band, with a mean time August 
17.13 UT (2.97 days after the burst).

The optical afterglow is well detected, with R=19.5 compared to several 
USNO stars in the field. The error is about 0.3 mag, completely due to 
the scatter in the calibration stars.
