Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100823A (trigger #432420)
(Mangano, et al., GCN Circ. 11135).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 20.706, 5.848 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 22m 49.4s 
   Dec(J2000) = +05d 50' 52.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 92%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED peak starting at ~T-2 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and ending at T+150 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
16.9 +- 3.5 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.2 to T+18.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.19 +- 0.18.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.1 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.14 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.0 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
