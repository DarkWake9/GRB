Adria C. Updike (Dickinson College), Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University), Peter A. Milne (Steward Observatory), and G. Grant Williams
(MMT Observatory) report:

We observed the field of GRB 111029A (Troja et al., GCN 12498) with the
robotic Super-LOTIS telescope under good conditions beginning 142 seconds
after the BAT trigger.  Our observations consisted of 5 10-sec images, 5
20-sec images, and 30 60-sec images in the R band.

Stacked images reveal no new sources in the XRT enhanced error circle
(Evans et al., GCN 12502) brighter than 19.5 magnitudes in R as calibrated
relative to the USNO B1.0 catalog.
