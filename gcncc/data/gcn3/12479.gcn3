Paul Vreeswijk, Annalisa De Cia (U. Iceland), Dong Xu (WIS), Daniele
Malesani (DARK), Páll Jakobsson (U. Iceland) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

Using ALFOSC on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) we have obtained R
(3 x 300 s) and I-band (5 x 400 s) imaging of the field of the Swift
GRB 111022B (Holland et al., GCN 12472), starting on 2011 October
23.097 UT (roughly 9.3 hours after the burst). The seeing during the
observations was around 1".

We do not detect any object within the enhanced XRT error circle
(Beardmore et al., GCN 12478), down to limiting magnitudes of about
R>23.2 and I>21.9 (calibrated against the USNO-B1 catalog).

We are grateful to the NOT observer, Terese Hansen (U. Copenhagen),
for obtaining these observations.
