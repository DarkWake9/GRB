Y. Urata (NCU) and K.Y Huang (ASIAA) on behalf of EAFON report;

"We observed the location of the GRB100414A optical afterglow
(Cucchiara et al. 10608) with CFHT on the night of April 19 (5.2 day
after the trigger) and 20 (6.2 day). The g', r' and i' band images
show the afterglow clearly. We estimate preliminary magnitudes of
r'=22.46+/-0.05 (5.19 day) and r'=22.84+/-0.05 (6.17 day) against the
SDSS field stars. Combined with the photometric results reported by
Filgas et al (10607) and Cucchiara (10606), the optical afterglow
light curves are well described by a simple power law decay with the
temporal index about 2.5."
