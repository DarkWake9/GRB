Using the data set from T-61 to T+242 sec from telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100213A (trigger #412217)
(Grupe, et al., GCN Circ. 10411).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 349.379, 43.370 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 17m 31.0s 
   Dec(J2000) = +43d 22' 13.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 59%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows four spikes between ~T-0.7 and ~T+2.5 sec
plus a low level tail out to ~T+40 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 2.4 +- 0.4 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.7 to T+2.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.34 +- 0.15.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.7 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.01 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
