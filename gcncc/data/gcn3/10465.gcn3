A. Cucchiara, D. B. Fox (PSU) report on behalf of
a larger collaboration:

"On March 3.40 UT we observed the field of GRB 100302A (Cummings et
al., GCN 10458) with the Gemini-N telescope and the GMOS spectrograph.

In our 300s i'-band acquisition image we clearly identify a source
inside the XRT refined error circle (Goad et al. 10460).
Using 3 USNO-B1 stars we calibrated our photometry and obtained

i' = 22.01 +- 0.05 mag

This value is significantly below the detection reported by
Huang et al. (GCN 10461) confirming that this is the afterglow
of GRB 100302A.

We also performed a single 1200s spectroscopic observation.
No absorption or emission features have been detected over
the 4000-9000A coverage of our spectrum.

We thank the Gemini staff for performing this observation,
in particular Andrew Stephens."
