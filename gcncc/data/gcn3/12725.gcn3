L.P. Xin,  J.Y. Wei, Y. L. Qiu,  J. Wang, J.S. Deng, 
C. Wu, X. H. Han on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB 111225A ( Siegel  et al., GCN 12720)
with Xinglong TNT telescope from 10:50:40  (UT), about 7 hour  after 
the burst.  

Preliminary analysis shows that the brightness of the optical afterglow counterpart ( Siegel  et al., GCN 12720, Klotz et al. GCN 12722, 
Adria et al. GCN 12723) has decayed to about R~20.4 mag 
relatively to USNO B1.O R2 mag, at the mean time of 7.7 hour 
after the burst.

More observations are encouraged.

Thanks for the observation assistant of TNT telescope at Xinglong observatory.
