Swift Team:

At 03:53:22 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 091029 (trigger=374210).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 60.183, -55.994 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 04h 00m 44s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 59' 37"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a double-peaked
structure with a duration of about 50 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~18 sec after the trigger. 

The XRT began observing the field at 03:54:41.9 UT, 79.3 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 60.17774, -55.95574 which
is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 04h 00m 42.66s
   Dec(J2000) = -55d 57' 20.7"
with an uncertainty of 4.4 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 138 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the
BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are
received; the latest position is available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of
1.14e+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). 

The initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 1.80e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10
keV). 


UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 90 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in
the rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at
  RA(J2000)  =	04:00:42.58 = 60.17742
  DEC(J2000) = -55:57:20.0  = -55.95555
with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.70 arc sec. This position is 2.3
arc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is
20.31 with a 1-sigma error of about 0.18. No correction has been made for the
expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.02.

regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
