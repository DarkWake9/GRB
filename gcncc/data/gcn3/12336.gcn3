DATE:    11/09/15 14:10:25 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Using  promptly downlinked XRT event data for GRB 110915A, we find an
enhanced XRT position of the afterglow: RA, Dec: 310.8242, -0.7241
which is equivalent to:
   RA (J2000)  = 20 43 17.81
   Dec (J2000) = -00 43 26.7
with an uncertainty of 3.4 arc sec (radius, 90% confidence). Analysis
of the promptly available data is online at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper/503219.

Position enhancement is is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476,
1401) and Evans et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
