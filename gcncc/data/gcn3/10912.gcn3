"At 18:32:28.47 UT on 25 June 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100625A (trigger 299183550 / 100625773).
which was also detected by the SWIFT-BAT(Holland et al. 2008, GCN 10884)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 125 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows of 2 closely spaced narrow pulses
with a duration (T90) of about 0.32 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.128 s to T0+0.192 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.64 +0.12/-0.11 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 509.2 +77.5/-61.5 keV

(C-stat value 710 for 609 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (8-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.32 +/- 0.05)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-0.128 s in the 8-1000 keV band
is 15.09 +/- 0.59 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
