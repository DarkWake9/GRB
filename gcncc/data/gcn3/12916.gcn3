Using the BAT data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of the outburst from LS I +61 303 (trigger #513505)
(Burrows, et al., GCN Circ. 12914).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 40.059, 61.235 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 40m 14.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +61d 14' 05.9" 
with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single, roughly symmetric pulse
starting at ~T+0.00 sec and ending at ~T+0.070 sec. 
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.040 +- 0.011 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.020 to T+0.064 sec is best fit by a blackbody
model.  The blackbody temperature is 5.69 +- 1.22 keV.  Chisq is 41.2 with 59 DoF.
The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.0 +- 3.2 x 10^-9 erg/cm2.  The 1-sec peak
photon flux measured from T-0.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 0.30 +- 0.19 ph/cm2/sec.
A simple power law fit yeilds an index of 3.92 +- 0.24 with a Chisq of 49.4 with
57 DoF.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
