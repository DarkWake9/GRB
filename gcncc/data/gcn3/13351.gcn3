team report:

The long GRB 120528B (MAXI/GSC detection and localization:
M. Morii et al., GCN 13346) was detected by Konus-Wind
in the waiting mode starting at T0(KW)= 65508 s UT (18:11:48),
~20s before the T0(MAXI).

The burst light curve shows a single pulse with a total duration of ~30s.

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence
of (2.9 ± 0.8)x10-6 erg/cm2 (in the 20 - 1200 keV energy range).

Modelling the K-W 3-channel time-integrated spectrum
(from T0(KW) to T0(KW)+26 s)
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
yields alpha = -0.41 ± 1.22, and Ep = 201 ± 112 keV

All the quoted errors are estimated at the 1 sigma confidence level.
