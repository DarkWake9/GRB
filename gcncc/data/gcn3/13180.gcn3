We observed GRB120327A (GCN13123) with the Australia Telescope Compact 
Array for 40 mins centered on 17:55UT on March 31 2012 (T0+4.625days).

We find an unresolved radio source at ra=16:27:27.4, dec=-29:24:54.0 
with a flux of 0.72+/-0.03 mJy. This position is consistent with the 
optical position of GCN13138.

Further observations are planned.

These observations were obtained as part of ATCA project C2689. We thank 
the observatory staff for their support and scheduling the observations. 
The Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for 
operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
