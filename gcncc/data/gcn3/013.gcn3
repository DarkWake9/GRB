GRB 971214 Optical Observations                                     #013


S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni, J. S. Bloom (Caltech), R. Goodrich (WMKO), 
and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of the Caltech GRB collaboration:  
"Analysis of the spectra of the proposed optical transient counterpart (OT) 
of GRB 971214, obtained at the Keck-II 10-m telescope on 17 Dec 1997 UT, 
shows a possible detection of an extended emission line at a wavelength of 
7567 A.  It is also intriguing that a faint emission line at a similar 
wavelength (7533 A) has been detected from a faint galaxy about 4.5 arcsec 
north of the OT (see our previous email on GCN3).  If this line emission from 
the OT is real, it can be interpreted as the [O II] 3727 line at z = 1.03.  
However, we emphasize that this marginal detection has to be checked with 
additional data."
