Brajesh Kumar, Vijay Bhatt and S. B. Pandey (ARIES Nainital, India, on
behalf
of larger Indian GRB collaboration).

The swift GRB 120211A (trigger =514586, Sonbas et al., GCN 12920) was
observed 
with the 104-cm telescope at ARIES Nainital. We took a sequence of images
starting at 13:31:26 UT on 11 Feb in R_c and I_c pass-bands with an
exposure
time of 300 sec each.

Photometry of the co-added R_c frame (300 sec x 4), in comparison to the
nearby
USNO- B1 stars, did not detect any new source within the XRT error-box down
to
a limiting magnitude of ~ 20 mag.
