TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1016
SUBJECT: GRB 010326 optical observations

I have obtained CCD images centered on the position of GRB 010326,
11:50:59.1 -23:32:44 (J2000), with the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory 0.9-m reflector, on 2001 March 26 from 08:18 to 08:50 UT. A
Johnson V filter was used, for a total of 1800 sec of integration, with a
field of view of 13' x 13'.

A preliminary comparison of the CCD frames with the 2nd-generation red
Digitized Sky Survey images of the same field discloses no obvious new
objects.
