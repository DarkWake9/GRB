S. R. Oates (MSSL-UCL) and T. N. Ukwatta (GSFC/GWU) report on behalf  
of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of
GRB 100621A 85s after the BAT trigger (Ukwatta et al., GCN 10870).
We detect a source at the enhanced Swift XRT position
(Evans et al. GCN 10873) and at the location of the GROND source
(Updike et al. GCN 10874). This source is also observed in the
DSS and observed to be constant during the first 7000s and is
thus likely to be the host galaxy, which is also suggested by Updike
et al. (GCN 10874).

The magnitudes and 3-sigma upper limits for the finding chart  
exposures (FC)
and summed images for this possible host galaxy are:

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction along the line of sight of E_(B-V) = 0.03 mag.
All photometry is on the UVOT photometric system described in Poole et
al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).
