report on behalf of the X-shooter GRB collaboration:

We continued with the analysis of X-shooter's spectrum
(Groot et al. GCN 10441) obtained for the afterglow of
GRB 100219A (Rowlinson et al. GCN 10430). Additionally to
the strong Ly-alpha absorption reported in the previous GCN
and the SiII and SiII* absorptions suggested by Cenko et al.
(GCN 10443) we detect several other absorption features,
including SII, OI, OI*, CII, CII*, SiIV, CIV, FeII, AlII and
AlIII at a redshift of 4.6667 +/- 0.0005. We also detect an
intervening system at z = 2.1810 +/- 0.0005 through the
identification of FeII, MgII and MgI. A second intervening
system might be present at z = 1.7980 +/- 0.0005 identified
by faint MgII and MgI absorptions. Further analysis is ongoing.
