M. De Pasquale (UNLV), D. Gruber (MPE), J. M. Burgess (UAH), J. McEnery 
(NASA/GSFC), S. T. Holland (STSCI), S. Razzaque (GMU/NRL) and J. L. 
Racusin (NASA/GSFC), on behalf of the Swift, Fermi-GBM, and the Fermi-LAT 
teams:

GRB 120624B, detected by Fermi-GBM (GCN 13377), Fermi-LAT (GCN 13379), 
Swift-BAT (GCN 13381), and Konus-Wind (GCN 13382) has very high fluence 
(1.9e-04 erg cm-2) and peak flux. The fluence of GRB 120624B in among the 
top 1.5% of bursts detected by Swift-BAT and the top 0.55% detected by 
Fermi-GBM.

The GRB position is unfortunately within the Swift Moon constraint. 
Swift-XRT/-UVOT follow-up observations are planned when if comes out of 
Moon constraint on June 27.4.

The refined BAT localization (GCN 13384) has an error radius of 1 arcmin 
(90% containment). There are 13 SDSS galaxies with r>24 within the BAT 
error circle. Analysis of the prompt emission suggests that the redshift 
of this event is z > ~0.3 if this burst obeys the Amati relation, with 
E_iso > ~4e+52 erg.

We strongly encourage follow-up observations of GRB 120624B.
