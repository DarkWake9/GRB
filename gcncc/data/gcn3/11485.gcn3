SUBJECT: GRB 101224A - UVOT-enhanced XRT position

K.L. Page, P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad (U. Leicester) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Upon analysis of the first downlink of Swift-XRT data for GRB 101224A, a 
faint source was detected within the BAT error circle (Krimm et al., GCN 
Circ. 11484). With the current data, it cannot be confirmed whether this 
source is fading.

Using 1245 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 1 UVOT image, we find an 
astrometrically corrected X-ray position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and 
matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 
285.92460, 45.71350 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  19 03 41.91
Dec (J2000): +45 42 48.5

with an uncertainty of 3.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received.  The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).
