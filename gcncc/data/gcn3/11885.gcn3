We observed GRB 110402A (Ukwatta et al. GCN 11857) in R, I, z,
and Y-bands using the 1 meter telescope at Mt. Lemmon, AZ, USA.
The observations started at Arpil 2, 04:18:22UT(245.4 min after the BAT trigger),
with the total integration time in each filter at 3 x 300 sec.
A faint source is identified at the positon reported in Mundell et al. (GCN 11858).
A preliminary analysis shows that the R-band magnitude is R=21.0 +- 0.3,
calibrated using R2 magnitude of USNO-B1 stars in the vicinty.

We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for his assistance for this
observation.

[GCN OPS NOTE(05apr11):  This circular was delay in distribution
by ~10 hours waiting for a new accont to be enetered.]
