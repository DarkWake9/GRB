P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift performed a second epoch observation of the INTEGRAL GRB 110206A 
(Mereghetti et al. GCN Circ. 11654), collecting 4.8 ks of data from 
T0+253 ks to T0+277 ks. The X-ray source reported by Evans et al. (GCN 
Circ. 11657) has clearly faded, confirming that this is the afterglow. 
The decay can be modelled as a single power-law decay with an index of 
1.1 (+0.2, -0.1).

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
