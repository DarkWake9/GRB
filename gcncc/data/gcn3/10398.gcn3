SUBJECT: GRB 100205A: BOAO/LOAO zYJK observation 
DATE:    10/02/09 14:50:50 GMT
FROM:    Myungshin Im at Seoul Nat U  <mim@astro.snu.ac.kr>

  M. Im, Y. Jeon, W. Park (CEOU/Seoul National Univ),
  H.-I. Sung (KASI) and Y. Urata (NCU) on behalf of EAFON team.

   We observed the GRB100205A (GCN 10361 Racusin et al.)
  with J and K-band using KASINICS instrument on the 1.8m telescope
  at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO), Korea,
  starting from 2010-02-05, 17:28:13 UT. We also observed the GRB
  with z and Y filters using the LOAO 1-m telescope,
  starting from 2010-02-05, 10:37:51 UT.

   We do not detect the afterglow at the reported position
  (GCN 10361.; GCN 10366, Tanvir et al.) in any of the bands
  with the upper limits summarized below.
   Our non-detection in K suggests that the afterglow candidate
  faded since the report of the K-band detection (GCN 10366;
  GCN 10374 Cucchiara et al.), confirming that it is
  an afterglow. The values for J and K-bands are preliminary,
  and we are refining the photometry. The data analysis of
  the 2nd night follow-up observation (z,Y) is on-going.

   We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for his assistance for this
   observation.
