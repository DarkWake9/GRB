A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), 
D. Baker (U. Leicester/U. Hertfordshire)  report for a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the short GRB 110112A (Stamatikos et al.
GCN 11553) with ACAM mounted on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT)
on La Palma. Observations began 15.5 hours after the GRB.  Within
the XRT localization (Evan et al. GCN 11556) we detect a faint,
possibly extended source at a position of

RA(J2000) 21:59:43.84 
DEC(J2000) 26:27:24.0

with an error of ~0.5" in each axis The source has a magnitude of
i~22, calibrated against nearby stars from the USNO B1 catalog.
This magnitude is fainter than that inferred for a candidate afterglow
of Xin et al. (GCN 11554), suggestive of fading between the two
epochs.  We note that the positions of the two objects are only
marginally consistent with each other, and suggest that the source
observed in our WHT observations is a candidate host galaxy for GRB
110112A, although with a single epoch we cannot constrain any
possible afterglow contribution at this time."
