P.A. Price, M.P. Hunt and D.W. Fox (Caltech) report on behalf
of the REACT GRB collaboration:

We have observed the error-circle of GRB 020409 (GCN #1347) with the
Palomar 200-inch telescope + LFC at 2002 Apr 11.15 UT and Apr 12.14 UT
(30.5 and 54.5 hours after the GRB, respectively) in Steidel R.  Our
images cover the entire error-circle down to a limiting magnitude of
R ~ 24 mag, with a small region with slightly less sensitivity.
We do not find any afterglow counterpart upon visual inspection of
the subtracted images.
