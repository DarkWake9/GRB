S. Foley (MPE) and S. Xiong (UAH)
report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers 338548960 (110924391)
at 09:22:38.40 UT on 24 September 2011 and 338618869 (110925200)
at 04:47:47.46 UT on 25 September 2011, tentatively classified as GRBs,
are in fact due to solar flares. Trigger 338470366 (110923481) at
11:32:44.46 UT on 23 September 2011 is too weak to classify reliably."
