A. Melandri, B. Sbarufatti and R. Margutti (INAF-OAB) reports on behalf
of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 9.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 110319A (Melandri  et al.
GCN Circ. 11807), from 47 s to 23.4 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data
comprise 33 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken
while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)
mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Goad et al.
(GCN. Circ 11808).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=3.7 (+0.6, -0.3). At T+151 s  the decay
flattens to an alpha of -0.63 (+0.07, -0.65). The light curve breaks
again at T+4335 s to a decay with alpha=0.98(+0.11, -0.10).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 3.4 (+0.4, -0.3). The
best-fitting absorption column is  2.4 (+0.7, -0.6) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 2.6 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.33 (+0.13, -0.14)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.16 (+0.32, -0.18) x 10^21
cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.3 x 10^-11 (5.0 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.16 (+0.32, -0.18) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 2.6 x 10^20 cm^-2
Excess significance: 10.8 sigma
Photon index:	     2.33 (+0.13, -0.14)
