SUBJECT: GRB 100628A: Swift XRT detection of a possible X-ray afterglow

R.L.C.  Starling (U. Leicester) and S. Immler (CRESST/GSFC/UMD) report on 
behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 8.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 100628A (Immler  et al. GCN
Circ. 10895), from 93 s to 18.8 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. A source is detected at the 3-sigma 
confidence level within the BAT refined error circle (Barthelmy et al. GCN 
Circ. 10896) at the position:
RA (J2000)  = 15 03 52.95
Dec (J2000) = -31 39 41.7
with an error of 5.2 arcsec (radius, 90% containment). This is 91.8 arcsec 
from the BAT refined position.

The possible source has a count rate of 0.0023+/-0.0007 count/s. We cannot 
determine whether the source is fading at this time.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
