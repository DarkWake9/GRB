P. Goldoni (APC/Univ. Paris 7 and SAp/CEA), and
N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) report on behalf of the X-shooter GRB GTO
collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 110128A (Grupe et al., GCN
11603; de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 11605) with the ESO VLT equipped
with X-shooter.

Observations lasted for two hours, with a mean time 2011 Jan 28.345 UT
(6.55 hr after the GRB). Sky transparency was non optimal, but the
seeing was around 0.9".

We detect a broad damped Lyman alpha feature, and other absorption
lines of OI, CII, SiIV, CIV, SiII and FeII at a common redshift of z=2.339.Â 
We also find an absorption feature at about 4960A which we tentatively
identify as an intervening CIV system at z=2.20.

We acknowledge excellent support from the astronomers at the VLT,
Dieter Nuernberger and Alvaro Alvarez.
