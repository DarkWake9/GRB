Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration report:

We re-observed the optical transient associated with
GRB 010921 (GCN ##1107,1108) with the Palomar 200-inch
telescope in Sloan g'r'i'z' on 2001 Oct 19.1 UT.  Magnitudes
of the counterpart were measured relative to stars in the
field calibrated with the Palomar 60-inch telescope and
the USNOFS 1.0-metre telescope (GCN #1100).  We find that,
at this epoch, the counterpart has a spectral flux distribution
that peaks between the r' and i' bands, and falls away on
the red and blue sides as ~ nu^3.5 and ~ nu^-2.1 respectively.

This spectral flux distribution finds a natural explanation
in terms of a supernova underlying the GRB afterglow (Bloom
et al. 1999; Reichart 1999; Galama et al. 2000).  If this
interpretation is correct, the source should continue to
fade beyond R ~ 22 mag over a timescale of a few weeks.

We strongly encourage further monitoring of this source,
especially in the blue and near infrared.

This message may be cited.
