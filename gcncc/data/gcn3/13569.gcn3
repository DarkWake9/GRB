P.A. Evans, K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and J.L. Racusin (NASA/GSFC) report
on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 2.5 ks of Photon Counting mode XRT data on GRB 120803A
from 155 s to 5.8 ks after the BAT trigger (Racusin et al., GCN Circ
13565). We find a single, uncatalogued X-ray source at RA,Dec =
269.5140, -6.7628 which is equivalent to:

   RA(J2000)  = 17h  58m 03.36s
   Dec(J2000) = -06d 45' 46.2"

with an uncertainty of 4 arc sec (radius, 90% containment). This
source is  4.2 arcmin from the original BAT position (GCN Circ 13565)
but only 2 arcmin from the refined BAT position (Ukwatta et al., GCN
Circ 13568), inside the refined BAT error circle.

The spectrum of this object can be modelled by an absorbed power-law
with a photon index of 1.1 (+0.9, -0.5). The absorption is consistent
with the Galactic value of 2.3e21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005).

The source has a mean count-rate of 0.014 (+/- 0.0029) ct/sec, we cannot
tell at this time whether the source is fading. Further observations are
planned.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
