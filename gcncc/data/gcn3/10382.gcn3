P.A. Evans and H. A. Krimm (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) report on behalf of the
Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 1.3 ks of XRT data for GRB 100206A (Krimm et al. GCN
Circ. 10376), from 82 s to 1.3 ks after the BAT trigger. The data are
entirely in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for
this burst was given by Goad et al. (GCN. Circ 10378).

The light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay
index of alpha=1.9 (+0.9/-0.7).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.0 (+1.2, -0.9). The
best-fitting absorption column is 3.5 (+5.3, -0.0) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.3 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al.
2005). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum is 4.6 x 10^-11 (7.4 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1.

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.9, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 1.9 x 10^-7 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.9 x
10^-17 (4.7 x 10^-17) erg cm^-2 s^-1.
