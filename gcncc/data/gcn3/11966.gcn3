Veli-Pekka Hentunen, Markku Nissinen and Tuomo Salmi (Taurus Hill
Observatory, Varkaus, Finland) report:

Taurus Hill Observatory's (A95) Celestron C-14 (OTA) telescope 14"
FL 3910 mm with NextGEN 0.5X optical reducer and SBIG ST-8XME 
camera were used to detect GRB 110422A optical afterglow. The 
observations were started at 2011-04-22 20:26:30 (UT) and stopped at 
2011-04-22 20:57:20 (UT) (~5 hours after the trigger). Six unfiltered 
observations with 300s exposure time were made. The afterglow was 
detected at following position RA 7 28 10.98 and DEC +75 06 25.4 
consistent those given by Elunko E. et al. (GCN 11958) to within positional
errors.

The following magnitudes were obtained from the observations using 
NOMAD1 1651-0051346 (R = 16.040) as the comparison:

Tmid(s)+T0  Filter          Exp (sec)     Mag      Mag err   Limit (sigma 3)
