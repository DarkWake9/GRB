Rajarshi (IUCAA) and Kuntal Misra (STScI)report:

We imaged the field of GRB100206A (Krimm et al. GCN 10376,
Goad et al GCN 10378) using the 2-m telescope of the IUCAA
Girawali Observatory. Four 15-min exposures in R-band were
taken on 06 Feb 2010 starting at 15:46 UT.  The stacked
1 hour exposure shows no optical transient to a limiting
magnitude of R ~22.  The extended source reported by Miller
et al (GCN 10377) is however clearly detected.
