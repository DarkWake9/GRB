Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110208A (trigger #445038)
(D'Ella, et al., GCN Circ. 11674).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 22.487, -20.561 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  01h 29m 56.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 33' 40.5" 
with an uncertainty of 1.8 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single peak starting at ~T-2 sec,
peaking at ~T+0.5 sec, and ending at ~T+20 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is
37.4 +- 7.9 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.5 to T+40.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.08 +- 0.31.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.7 +- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.46 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.6 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
