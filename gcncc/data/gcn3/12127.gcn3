Using the data set from T-239 to T+733 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110709A (trigger #456939)
(Holland, et al., GCN Circ. 12118).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 238.895, 40.918 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  15h 55m 34.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +40d 55' 06.4" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 91%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows at least 8 peaks starting at T-5 sec,
with the brightest peak at ~T+34 sec, and returning to background
at ~T+100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 44.7 +- 1.0 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-4.3 to T+65.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.24 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.0 +- 0.02 x 10^-05 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+34.31 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 6.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
