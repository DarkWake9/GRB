SUBJECT: GRB 110112B:  A short GRB detected by INTEGRAL

S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA-Saclay), J. Borkowski (CAMK, 
Torun), E. Bozzo, C.Ferrigno, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), on behalf of the 
IBAS Localization Team report:

A short gamma ray burst lasting about 0.5 s has been detected by IBAS in 
the IBIS/ISGRI data at 22:24:54.6 UT of January 12.

The detection significance was slightly below the threshold for automatic 
alert delivery.

Its refined coordinates (J2000) are:
  RA:  10.599  [degrees]
  DEC: 64.406  [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin (90% c.l.).

A preliminary analysis gives a   20-200 keV fluence of about  1e-7 
erg/cm2 and a peak flux of about 5 ph/cm2 s  (0.1 s integration time)

A plot of the light curve will be posted at

NOTE: Automatic distribution of sky coordinates of low significance 
INTEGRAL IBAS triggers is currently under testing. This service will soon 
be made available to the interested users.
