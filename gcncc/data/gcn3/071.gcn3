report:

Monitoring of the time-variable radio source (GCN 63, IAUC 6896, GCN
70) coincident with a supernova candidate proposed by Galama et
al. (GCN 60, IAUC 6895) has continued with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array at 20, 13, 6 and 3 cm.  The radio source may have reached
a peak on May 7 1998 at 6 and 3 cm of 45 and 49 mJy, respectively.  A
radio light curve, spectra, and individual maps are available at
