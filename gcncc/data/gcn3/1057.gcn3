SUBJECT: SGR 1900+14: No evidence of extended X-ray emission

D. W. Fox and D. L. Kaplan (Caltech) report:  

"Our earlier report of a pulse phase-variable PSF width in Chandra
observations of SGR 1900+14 (GCN 1049) was in error.  Appropriate
treatment of the background counts relative to source counts reveals
that the one-dimensional PSF is consistent with a Gaussian of fixed
standard deviation equal to 0.41(1) arcseconds throughout the pulse
phase.  We therefore retract our claim of detection of extended X-ray
emission in this data."
