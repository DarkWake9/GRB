S. Meehan, L. Hanlon, M. Topinka (UCD Dublin), P. Kubanek (FZU AV CR 
Prague), report on behalf of a large collaboration:

We imaged the field of IGR J17062-6143 detected by Swift (trigger 
525148) with the Watcher robotic telescope (D=40cm) located at Boyden 
Observatory, Bloemfontein, South Africa.

The first on-target observation started 300 seconds after the BAT 
trigger time of 22:42:31 UT and before the earliest PROMPT observations 
reported in GCN 13390. The initial airmass was 1.2 and conditions were 
non-photometric.

The initial two exposures were taken in the Clear filter and were 30 
seconds long.

We detect a source at the position of the UVOT source (GCN 13386) in the 
first image with R-band magnitude of 14.8 ± 0.3 (4-sigma) with the 
limiting magnitude in the frame being 15.6 mag (2-sigma upper limit). In 
the second image the source is not detected, but the limiting magnitude 
is 15.1. These results are not sufficient to confirm fading behavior as 
seen at later times by PROMPT (GCN 13390) and GROND (ATEL 4214). Later 
images obtained by Watcher are being analysed.

Magnitudes were estimated using the nearby USNO-B1 stars as references 
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
