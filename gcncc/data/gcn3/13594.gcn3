Using the data set from T-239 to T+330 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120805A (trigger #530031)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 13588).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 216.536, 5.853 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  14h 26m 08.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = +05d 51' 09.7" 
with an uncertainty of 2.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 37%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping peaks starting at
~T-8 sec, peaking at ~T+8 sec, and returning to baseline around T+110 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 48.00 +- 22.63 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-15.39 to T+32.61 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.20 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.2 +- 1.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+8.11 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.37 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
