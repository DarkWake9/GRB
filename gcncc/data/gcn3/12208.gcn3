TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  12208
SUBJECT: Swift triggers 458268 and 458269 are not astrophysical
DATE:    11/07/28 03:38:40 GMT
FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>

S. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift Team reports:

The startracker on Swift has lost lock, so erroneous ACS information
has caused the two recent BAT triggers (458268 and 458269) to misidentify
two known sources as unknown sources.  Please disregard these two sets
of GCN/Swift Notices.

Further GCN/Swift trigger notices are being blocked to world distribution.

The Flight Operations Team is currently recovering the Startracker to 
normal operations.
