(KIAM) report on behalf of larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 120121A  (Page et al.,  GCN 12885)
with 0.45-m telescope ISON-NM observatory on Jan. 21. We took several
unfiltered images of  60 s exposure on Jan. 21, starting (UT) 12:29:25.  We
do not detect any object within the XRT error circle (Page et al., GCN 12886
), down to 19.7m (calibrated against the USNO B1.0 catalog).
