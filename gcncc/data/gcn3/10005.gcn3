TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  10005
SUBJECT: SuperAGILE GRB is 091010 and not 090910
DATE:    09/10/10 05:42:54 GMT
FROM:    Marco Feroci at IASF/INAF  <sa.grb@iasf-roma.inaf.it>

Marco Feroci (INAF/IASF Rome) reports:

I made a mistake in the name of the GRB, that is GRB 091010
instead of GRB 090910, as cited in the previous circular.

The burst trigger time indicated in GCN #10004 was correct.

I apologize for the confusion.
