David Gruber (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 13:49:27.63 UT on 06 September 2010, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 100906A (trigger 305473769 / 100906576)
which was also detected by the Swift-BAT (Markwardt et al. 2010, GCN 11227)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position. 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 95 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows several bright peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 105 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0 to T0+122 s is 
best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 106.0 +17.5/-20.2 keV, 
alpha = -1.34 +0.08/-0.06, and beta = -1.98 +0.06/-0.07. 
(Castor C-stat 1044 for 479 d.o.f.)

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(2.64E-05 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+10.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 14.45 +/- 0.29 ph/s/cm^2.


The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
