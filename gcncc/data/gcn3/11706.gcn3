S. B. Cenko (UC Berkeley) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the error circle of GRB110213A (D'Elia et al., GCN
11705) with the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope.  Observations began
at 05:19 UT (~ 2 minutes after the burst trigger time) and were taken in
the r' filter.  We detect a bright source at the location of the UVOT
afterglow, with coordinates:

   02:51:51.43   +49:16:23.3

Using several USNO-B1 field stars for comparison, we measure a magnitude
of R ~ 17.1 at this time.  Observations are ongoing.
