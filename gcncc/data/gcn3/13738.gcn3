The wide field "Pi of the Sky South" telescope, installed in
the private observatory of Alain Maury in San Pedro de Atacama 
(http://grb.fuw.edu.pl/pi/index.html#spda_site.htm) observed coordinates 
of the GRB 120909A, starting 10 s exposure 94 s after the reported SWIFT 
BAT detection. No new source was identified. The limiting magnitude is 
11.6, based on the reference star magnitudo in V filter.
