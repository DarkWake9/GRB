"G. Fitzpatrick (UCD) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

Apologies, the event fluence (10-1000 keV) should be (3.84 +/- 0.13)
E-06 erg/cm^2. This is consistent with the value reported by
Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al, GCN 11127).

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
