J. P. Halpern & N. Mirabal (Columbia U.) report on behalf
of the MDM Observatory GRB team:

"Using the MDM 1.3m telescope, we obtained R-band images
covering the error box of GRB 010629 as defined by the
overlap of the HETE error circle (Ricker et al. GCN #1075)
and the IPN annulus (Hurley et al. GCN #1076) beginning on
June 30 3:35 UT and ending at 7:50 UT.  These images are
deeper than the DSS.  We don't see any new object, but an
asteroid passed through the error box.  Moving west at a
rate of 27"/hour, it was located at 16:32:17.9, -18:49:59
(J2000) on June 30 4:34 UT.

Concerning the possible high proper motion star reported by
Henden (GCN #1077), we see both it and its neighbor 10" to
the west.  Therefore, it is a `new' object, but one of many
that are near the limit of the DSS.

The proximity of the moon has prevented useful follow-up
coverage from being made."

This message may be cited, although we can't imagine why.
