A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired single V-band images with the NOFS 1.0m
telescope from 011020 0537-0703 UT, forming a mosaic that
covers the central 32x32arcmin of the HETE error box (GCN 1109).
Our images go somewhat fainter than the DPOSS limit.

We find no new source down to the DPOSS limit within
our field.  There is one bright asteroid about 9arcmin NW of
the field center, near a pair of bright stars, moving towards the east.
