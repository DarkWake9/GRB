At 02:57:46 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 111109A (trigger=507342).  Swift did not slew due an
observing constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 118.196, -41.599, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  07h 52m 47s
   Dec(J2000) = -41d 35' 54"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a few peaks with a
total duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+49.2 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is C. Pagani (cp232 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
