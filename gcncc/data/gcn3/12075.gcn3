The bright GRB 110604A (IPN and Swift/BAT ; Barthelmy et al., GCN 12063) 
triggered the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which covers an energy
range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 14:49:42 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows a multi-peaked structure starting at
T0-13s, ending at T0+31s with a duration (T90) of about 27 seconds. There 
is a possible precursor at T0-13s with a duration of about 1 second. The
fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.96 (-0.12, +0.10) x10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+2s was 7.68 (-0.98, +0.75) photons/cm^2/s
in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum including the precursor
from T0-13s to T0+31s is well fitted by a single power-law with a photon index
of 2.49 (-0.15, +0.17) (chi^2/d.o.f = 14.0/15).
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
