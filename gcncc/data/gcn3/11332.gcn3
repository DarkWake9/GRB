Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 101011A (trigger #436094)
(Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circ. 11331).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 48.274, -65.990 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 13m 05.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -65d 59' 23.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 87%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows an initial FRED-like pulse starting
at ~T-0.3 sec, peaking at ~T+0.6 sec, then followed by several other weaker 
peaks lasting out to ~T+90 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 71.5 +- 18.3 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.4 to T+84.2 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.24 +- 0.14.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.3 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
