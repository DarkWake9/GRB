Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of the BAT short hard burst GRB 101219A (trigger #440606)
(Gelbord, et al., GCN Circ. 11461).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 74.586, -2.527 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  04h 58m 20.7s 
   Dec(J2000) = -02d 31' 37.1" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 94%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks starting at ~T-0.1 sec
and ending at ~T+0.6 sec.  At the 2-sigma confidence level, there may be
extended emission out to T+30 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.6 +- 0.2 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.0 to T+1.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.63 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.6 +- 0.3 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
