FROM:    Jens Hjorth at U.Copenhagen  <jens@astro.ku.dk>

J. Hjorth, on behalf of Javier Gorosabel (who is in transit) and the
Danish/Spanish GRB collaboration, reports observations of the likely
optical afterglow of GRB 020322 obtained with the NOT on Mar 23 2002 UT.

A smoothed R-band image (6 x 900 sec) is posted at

By comparison with the image posted by Bloom et al. (GCN #1296)
it is evident that the likely optical afterglow (object b,
cf. GCN ##1294,1296,1298,1299) had faded to below R ~ 24 at
the time of observations.
