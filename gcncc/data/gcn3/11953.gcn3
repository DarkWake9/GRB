B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/IASFPA) and V. Mangano (INAF/IASFPA) report on 
behalf of the Swift XRT team:

Further observations of the field of GRB 110420B (Sbarufatti  et al.
GCN Circ. 11944) have shown that the X-ray source reported by Sbarufatti 
et al. (GCN Circ. 11947) has not faded.  Moreover, the position is 
marginally consistent with the known X-ray source 1RXS J212024.5-411816. 
Therefore we conclude that the XRT source is not the burst afterglow.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
