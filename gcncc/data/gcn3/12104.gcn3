Using the data set from T-120 to T+182 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of SGRB 1E 1841-045 (trigger #456505)
(Melandri, et al., GCN Circ. 12103).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 280.349, -4.953 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 41m 23.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -04d 57' 09.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.2 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T-0.01 sec
and ending at ~T+0.04 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.036 +- 0.012 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.004 to T+0.032 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.89 +- 0.4.  The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.48 sec
in the 15-150 keV band is 1.1 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.

We note the recent activity of this source: Swift BAT trigger 445776
on 11 Feb 2011, and trigger 455904 on 23 Jun 2011 (GCN 12079 & 12082).
