E. Berger (Harvard), D. Fox (Penn State) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:


We observed the candidate optical afterglow of GRB 110918A reported by
Tanvir et al. (GCN12365) with the GMOS-N spectrograph on Gemini-N,
Mauna Kea.  Observations began at 20-Sep-2011 12:51 UT.  The trace is
well detected and consistent with being a power-law continuum,
confirming that this source is very likely the afterglow of the burst
detected by the IPN (Hurley et al. GCN12357, see also Cenko et
al. GCN12367).  We identify absorption features of MgII (2796A/2804A),
MgI (2853A) and CaII (3935A/3970A) at a common redshift of z=0.982 (based
on a provisional wavelength calibration).


We thank the Gemini staff, particularly Jen Holt, for obtaining
these observations.
