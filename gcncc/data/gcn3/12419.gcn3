A. Zauderer, E. Berger, A. M. Soderberg (Harvard), and D. A. Frail 
(NRAO) report:

"We observed the BAT error circle of GRB 111005A (GCN #12415) with the 
EVLA on 2011 October 5.98 UT (15.4 hours after the burst) at a frequency 
of 5 GHz.  We detect two sources within the error circle at the 
following coordinates (J2000):

EVLA-S1:
RA = 14:53:07.78
DEC = -19:44:12.2

EVLA-S2:
RA 14:53:11.64
DEC -19:43:30.8

EVLA-S1 coincides with the disk of the z=0.01326 galaxy ESO 580-49 
(Levan et al. GCN #12414), and is located about 2.5 arcsec from its 
bulge.  It is therefore a possible counterpart of GRB 111005A.  EVLA-S2 
is detected in the NVSS survey with a 1.4 GHz flux density of 5.7 mJy 
and is thus unlikely to be related to GRB 111005A.

Additional observations to check for variability of EVLA-S1 are in 
progress."
