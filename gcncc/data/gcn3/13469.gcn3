David Gruber (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 13:42:25.61 UT on 12 July 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120712A (trigger 363793348 / 120712571).
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Page et al. 2012, GCN 13454).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 42 degrees.

This burst was also independently detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.

The GBM light curve consists of two overlapping peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 23 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3 s to T0+16 s is
well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 124 +/- 26 keV, 
alpha = -0.6 +/- 0.2, and beta = -1.80 +/- 0.02.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(4.43 +/- 0.05)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+9.3 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
