A.J. Levan (U. Warwick), N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester), M. Hrudkova (ING) report for a larger collaboration:

"We obtained observations of GRB 120521C (Baumgartner et al. GCN 13318) with the William Herschel Telescope equipped with ACAM in the r and z-bands. Our observations started at 00:01UT, 39 minutes after the burst trigger. We do not detect any afterglow candidates within the XRT error circle. Provisional limits, calibrated against SDSS suggest r>24.0, z>22.5"
