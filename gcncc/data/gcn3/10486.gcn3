M. H. Siegel (PSU) and W. H. Baumgartner (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf  
of the
Swift/UVOT team:

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 3200 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow  
candidate
has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image  
covers 100%
of the XRT error circle (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 10485). The  
typical 3-sigma
upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of  
sources
generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of  
sources is
typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for  
the expected
extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.03.
