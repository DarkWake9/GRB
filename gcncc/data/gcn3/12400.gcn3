A. N. Morgan, C. R. Klein and J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) report:

We observed the field of GRB 110928A (Hoversten et al., GCN 12394)
with the 1.3m PAIRITEL located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations
began at 2011-Sep-28 02h03m59s UT, ~12.5 min after the Swift trigger.
In  mosaics (effective exposure time of 678.6 s) taken simultaneously
in the J, H, and Ks filters, we do not detect any source within the
XRT error circle (Evans et al. GCN 12398).

Deeper NIR observations are underway. All magnitudes are given in the
Vega system, calibrated to 2MASS. No correction for Galactic
extinction has been made to the above reported values.
