A. Zauderer, E. Berger (Harvard), and D.A. Frail (NRAO) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the Swift burst GRB 110731A (GCN 12215) with the EVLA
beginning on 2011 Aug 1.15 UT (0.68 days after the burst).
Observations were performed at 5.75 and 22 GHz for about 30 min
at each frequency.  No radio source is detected in coincidence
with the optical afterglow (GCN 12215), to a 3-sigma limit of
~50 microJy at 5.75 GHz.  Additional observations are planned."
