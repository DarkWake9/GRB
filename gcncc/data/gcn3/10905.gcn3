N.R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) and A.J. Levan (U. Warwick) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We re-observed the location of the short-hard GRB 100625A using
GMOS on Gemini-South on 2010-06-28 beginning at 09:21 UT
(approximately 63 hours post-burst).

The source we previously identified within the XRT error circle
(Levan et al. GCN 10887) is still detected with no obvious fading.
We therefore concur with Berger et al. (GCN 10897) that this source,
which is marginally extended, is a good candidate to be the host
galaxy of the GRB.

We thank the staff of Gemini South, in particular Fredrik Rantakyro,
for their assistance with these observations.

[GCN OPS NOTE(29jun10): Per author's request, the "North" in the Subject-line
was changed to "South".]
