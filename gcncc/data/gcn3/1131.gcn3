report on behalf of the LOTIS collaboration:

Super-LOTIS observed the HETE/IPN error box of GRB 010921
(GCNC #1096, #1097) on 09/22/2001 starting at 03:05 UTC, 
21.8 hr after the burst. Super-LOTIS is a 0.6 m telescope 
located at Kitt Peak. These observations were made with a 
clear filter and an effective integration time is 1000 s. 
We detect the afterglow reported by Price et al. (GCNC #1107) 
at 2 epochs. The magnitude of the afterglow is calibrated 
against R band secondary standards reported in GCNC #1100 
by Henden.
