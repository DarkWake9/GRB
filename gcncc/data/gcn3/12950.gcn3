Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 09:11:23.50 UT on 12 February 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120212A (trigger 350730685 / 120212383) which
was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Sonbas et al. 2012, GCN 12930).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 53 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of a single peak
with a duration (T90) of about 9.2 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.1 s to T0+6.1 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.83 ± 0.06

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(1.407 ± 0.120)E-07 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.64 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 3.3 ± 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
