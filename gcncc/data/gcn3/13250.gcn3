We imaged the field of GRB 120422A detected by SWIFT
(trigger 520658) with the Zadko robotic telescope (D=100cm)
located at the observatory - Gingin, Australia.

The observations started 3.6h and finished 4.8h
after the GRB trigger.

Weather conditions were good but a poor seeing
of 3.5 arcsec does not allow to separate the
GRB afterglow (Cucchiara et al. GCNC 13245) and
the SDSS galaxy J090738.51+140108.3.

We added the r, g, i SDSS images to create an
equivalent of the Zadko unfiltered image.
The star R=16.37 at ra=136.9080750 dec=+14.0119528
J2000 was used as reference. The flux ratio
of the reference star and the galaxy shows that an
additional component at R=21.1 should be present
in the galaxy on the Zadko image.
