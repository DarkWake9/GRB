(Harvard) report:

"We re-observed the peculiar Swift event GRB110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451
(GCNs 11823, 11824) with the EVLA on March 30.49 UT.  At the two
frequenciescentered at 4.94 and 6.69 GHz we find that the
previously-detected radio
source (GCN 11836) has significantly brightened (~10-sigma confidence
level).

This provides the first clear evidence connecting the quiescent optical
source at z=0.35 (GCNs 11827, 11830, 11833, 11834), which is positionally
coincident with the brightening radio source, and the transient
X-ray/gamma-ray source (which is localized to only 1.7" radius accuracy; GCN
11826)."
