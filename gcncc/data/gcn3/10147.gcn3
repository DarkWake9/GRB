TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  10147
SUBJECT: GRB091109: Correction to GCN 10139
DATE:    09/11/09 19:08:33 GMT
FROM:    Angelo Antonelli at Obs. Astro. di Roma  <a.antonelli@oa-roma.inaf.it>

L.A. Antonelli, S. Covino, P. D'Avanzo, report on behalf of the REM team:

"We have to correct the position of the object reported in our previous GCN
10139: due to a typo the R.A. position of the putative NIR afterglow of
GRB091109 reported is RA(J2000) 20:37:02.02 instead of RA(J2000) 20:37:02.2.

However, we note that the correct position is still about 2" far away from the
UVOT position (Oates, GCN 10143). The observed source in the REM H band early
images is very faint and close to the detection limit of our images. So due to
the misplacement with the UVOT position the observed object may be a background
fluctuation not related to GRB091109. A detailed analysis is in progress."
