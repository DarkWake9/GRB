report:

We re-observed the optical afterglow candidate (Rossi et al.
GCN Circ. 10008) of the SuperAGILE GRB 091010 (Donnarumma
et al. GCN Circ. 10004) with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope South
(FTS) on October 16, 09:27:33 UT (6.3 days post burst)
with the Ri' filters.

The source is still clearly detected in both filters.
Comparison with our previous values obtained at 1 day
post burst (Guidorzi et al. GCN Circ. 10017) shows that
the source did not fade appreciably.
We derived an upper limit to the possible power-law
decay index of alpha<0.5 (90% confidence) from 1 to
6 days post burst, flux~t^(-alpha).
Given that a comparably shallow and long-lasting decay
has never been observed, we can confidently rule out
this source as the optical afterglow of GRB 091010.
