We observed the field of GRB 100213A detected by Swift
(trigger #412217; Grupe et al., GCN Circ. 10411) with the 14-inch
Goddard Robotic Telescope (GRT) located at the Goddard Geophysical
and Astronomical Observatory (http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggao/).

Total 49 images of 60 sec exposures were taken in the R filter 
starting from February 13 23:42:02 (UT) about 1.2 hours after 
the trigger and stopped on February 14 01:28:00 (UT).  We do 
not detect the optical afterglow both in the individual images 
and the combined image inside the XRT position 
(Beardmore et al., GCN #10418).  The estimated three sigma upper 
limit of the combined image (total exposure of 1800 sec; excluding 
bad quality images) is ~17.5 mag using the USNO-B1 catalog.
