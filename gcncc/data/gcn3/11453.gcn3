Using the data set from T-240 to T+963 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 101213A (trigger #440285)
(Sakamoto, et al., GCN Circ. 11448).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 241.297, 21.905 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  16h 05m 11.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +21d 54' 17.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 31%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two overlapping peaks.  The first peak is starting 
at ~T-5 sec and peaking at ~T+0.  The second peak is peaking at ~T+15 sec, and roughly 
exponential decaying out to ~T+100 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 135 +- 38 sec 
(estimated error including systematics).  
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.1 to T+197.1 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.53 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 5.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.26 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
