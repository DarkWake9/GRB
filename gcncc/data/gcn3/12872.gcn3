The long GRB 120119A (Swift-BAT trigger #512035:
Beardmore et al., GCN 12859)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=14674.872s UT (04:01:34.872)

The burst light curve shows a multi-peaked pulse
with a total duration of ~61 s.
The emission is seen up to ~7 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120119_T14674/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (4.7 ± 0.6)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 256-ms peak flux, measured from T0+16.384 s,
of (3.9 ± 0.5)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+49.152 s)
is best fitted in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.85 (-0.16, +0.20),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.34 (-0.22, +0.15),
the peak energy Ep = 153(-19, +21) keV,
chi2 = 73.5/84 dof.

The spectrum of the initial pulse
(measured from T0 to T0+16.384 s) is best fitted
is best fitted in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
with the GRB (Band) model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.92 (-0.13, +0.14),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.41 (-0.35, +0.16),
the peak energy Ep = 192(-21, +29) keV,
chi2 = 72.4/84 dof.

Assuming the redshift z=1.73 (Cucchiara & Prochaska, GCN 12865;
Pancoast et al., GCN 12866; Milisavljevic et al., GCN 12867)
and a standard cosmology model
with H_0 = 71 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.27, Omega_Lambda = 0.73,
the isotropic energy release E_iso is (3.6 ± 0.5)x10^53 erg,
the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso_max is (5.1 ± 0.7)x10^52 erg/s,
and Ep_rest is (265 ± 35) keV.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
