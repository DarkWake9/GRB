E. Berger and R. Chornock (Harvard) report on behalf of a larger 
collaboration:

"We obtained a second epoch of i-band imaging of the short GRB 100206A
(GCN 10376) with GMOS on the Gemini-North 8-m telescope starting on
2010 Feb 12.28 UT.  Digital image subtraction of the new observation
relative to our previous i-band epoch from 2010 Feb 7.23 UT (GCN
10395) using the ISIS software package does not reveal any fading
sources to a 3-sigma limit of i>24.7 mag within the XRT error circle
(GCN 10378), in coincidence with the nearby bright galaxy at z=0.41
(GCN 10389), or in coincidence with the nearby fainter galaxy (GCNs
10386,10395).  We therefore place a limit of i>24.7 mag on the
brightness of the optical afterglow at 15.7 hours after the burst."
