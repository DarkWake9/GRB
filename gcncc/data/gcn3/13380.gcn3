A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 07:24:25.34  UT on 24 June 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120624A (trigger 362215467 / 120624309).
The burst was also detected by the 3rd Interplanetary Network (Golenetskii
et al. 
2011, GCN 13376). The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 90.2 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single FRED-like pulse 
with a duration (T90) of about 0.7 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.448 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.83 (+0.02/-0.02) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 3800 (+200/-180) keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(6.5 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 0.064-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 78.245 +/- 2.4 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak = 3700 (+200/-220)
keV, 
alpha = -0.83 (+0.02/-0.02) and beta = -3.4 (+0.4/-0.8).

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
