SUBJECT: GRB 120403B: AAT nIR observations
DATE:    12/04/04 14:53:57 GMT
FROM:    Rhaana Starling at U of Leicester  <rlcs1@star.le.ac.uk>

Rhaana Starling, Klaas Wiersema (U. Leicester), Stuart Ryder (AAO), Peter Barnes (U. Florida) and Christopher Stockdale (Marquette Univ.) report:

We began observations of the field of GRB 120403B with IRIS2 on the 4m Anglo-Australian Telescope on 2012-04-04 at 08:34:00 UT, 
12 hours after the BAT trigger (D'Elia et al., GCN Circ. 13203). We performed near-infrared photometry in the Ks, H and J bands, 
totalling 2x9 minutes in each filter. 

We do not detect any source within the UVOT-enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCN Circ. 13205) down to limiting magnitudes of
Ks > 19.4 mag
H  > 20.0 mag
J  > 20.9 mag.
Calibration was carried out using 8 2MASS field stars. No correction for Galactic extinction has been applied.


These observations were obtained under programme AAT/11B/21.
