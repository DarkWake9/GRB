Adria C. Updike, Ginger Bryngelson, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson
University) and Peter A. Milne (Steward Observatory) report:

We observed the field of GRB 100802A (Troja et al., GCN 11031) with the
3.5m WIYN telescope at KPNO equipped with WHIRC on August 3, 2010
beginning 26 hours and 13 minutes after the trigger and continuing for 26
minutes in the K band under good conditions.  We do not detect the
afterglow (Siegel & Troja, GCN 11032; Cenko, GCN 11040) or any source
within the enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 11036) to limiting
magnitude of K > 18.8 upon comparison to the 2MASS catalog and field
stars.  No further observations are planned.
