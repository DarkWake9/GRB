A. Volnova  (SAI MSU), A. Pozanenko (IKI),  O. Vozyakova (SAI MSU), B. 
Satovski (Astrotel),  M. Im (Seoul National Univ), M. Ibrahimov (MAO) report 
on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 100814A (Beardmore et al. GCN  11087) 
with AZT-22 telescope of Maidanak observatory. Several images in R  were 
obtained starting on Aug. 14 (UT) 22:56:44. We clearly the afterglow 
(Schaefer et al. GCN  11086; Beardmore et al. GCN  11087). The photometry of 
stacked image against USNO-B1.0 field stars  is following

 t-T0,       Filter,   Exposure,    OT,       Upper limit (3 sigma)
(mid, d)               (s)
0.81185   R         30*60         18.75+/-0.01          23.4

the photometry error is statistical only.
