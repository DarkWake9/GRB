report:

We observed the field towards SGR 1900+14 in the I-band using the 
Tautenburg Schmidt telescope equipped with the Schmidt focus CCD camera
(14 frames, 2 min exposure time each). Observations were performed on
April 19, 1:12 UT - 2:19 UT, i.e., about 18 hours after the giant 
gamma-ray flare discovered by BeppoSAX and Ulysses (Guidorzi et al., GCN
#1041; Hurley et al., GCN #1043). Of the 14 frames obtained we finally
added 8 to construct an image. The other frames are affected by a cloudy
sky.

At the position of the fading radio source discovered after the strong 
outburst in 1998 (Frail et al. 1999, Nature 398, 127; see also Fig. 1 in
Vrba et al. 2000, ApJ 533, L17) we detect no object down to a limiting
magnitude of about I=21.
