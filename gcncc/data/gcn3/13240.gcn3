FROM:    Scott Barthelmy at NASA/GSFC  <scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>

S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) on behalf of the Swift-BAT team:
 
Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we confirm that BAT trigger 519874 (Barthelmy, et al., GCN Circ. 13238)
is due to noise in the BAT detector (specifically a cosmic ray shower
in the instrument).
