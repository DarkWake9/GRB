  A.J. van der Horst (NASA/MSFC/ORAU) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM 
Team:

"The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger 306355274 at 
18:41:12.49 UT
on 16 September 2010, tentatively classified as Distant Particles, is in 
fact
a GRB. The source location is close to the Earth's limb, which gave rise to
the original classification. The GBM light curve consists of a ~0.5 s short
spike on top of lower level emission extending for ~20 s.

The on-ground location of GRB 100916A, using the GBM trigger data, is
RA = 152.0, Dec = -59.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to 10h 08m, -59d 23'),
with an uncertainty of 3.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, 
statistical
only; there is additionally a systematic error which is currently estimated
to be 2 to 3 degrees). The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 142 
degrees."
