GRB 020405, U-band observations
---------------------------

A. J. Castro-Tirado, J. Gorosabel (Instituto de Astrofísica  de
Andalucía, IAA-CSIC, Granada), T. Augusteijn (Isaac Newton
Group of Telescopes) and José María Castro Cerón (ROA,San Fernando) 
report:

We have observed the central region of the GRB 020405 error box
(Hurley et al., GCN Circ. 1325) with the Prime Focus Camera at the
4.2-m William HerschelTelescope at the ORM in La Palma, providing
a 16'.2 square field of view. A comparison of  the  U- and R-band
images obtained on Apr 6.104-6.122 UT reveals an extremely blue
object at the position of the optical candidate proposed by Price et al.

(GCN Circ. 1326) thus supporting the relationship with the GRB.
This U-band detection would imply that the redshift  is < 2.1 .

This message can be cited.
