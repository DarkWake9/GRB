Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100619A (trigger #424998)
(Cannizzo, et al., GCN Circ. 10863).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 84.618, -27.012 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 38m 28.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = -27d 00' 42.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 75%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two well separated peaks.  The first
s compsed of several overlapping pulses which starts at ~T-3 sec, peaks at
~T_10 sec, and returns to background at ~T+20 sec.  The second peak starts
~T+55 sec, peaks at ~T=85 sec, and ends at ~T+120 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV)
is 97.5 +- 3 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.9 to T+105.7 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.83 +- 0.06.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+87.22 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 4.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
