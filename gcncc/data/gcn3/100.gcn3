TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: GRB980611

K. Hurley, UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, on behalf of
the 3rd Interplanetary Network, resports:

We have obtained a slightly refined, but still preliminary IPN
annulus for GRB980611 (BATSE 6816).  The annulus is centered at
RA(2000)=330.015 degrees, Dec(2000)=-10.611 degrees, and has
a radius of 79.520 +/- 0.029 degrees.  This annulus intersects
the LOCBURST error circle, but the two RXTE sources lie outside
the annulus by 0.66 and 0.81 degrees.  Therefore it is highly
unlikely that either is related to the GRB.  An image may be
found at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/980611/.
