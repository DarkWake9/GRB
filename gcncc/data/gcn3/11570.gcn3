report:

In light of the continuing uncertainty about the nature of GRB 101225A,
we performed a search for any periodic signal in the BAT and XRT light curves
for this event.Â  In neither case do we find any significant periods in the data: from
~0.01 Hz (100 s periods) to ~100 Hz (0.01 s periods) in the case of BAT (data from
50-900 s post-trigger), and from ~0.004 Hz (250 s periods) to ~1 Hz in XRT (2nd orbit
data).
