Johan Bregeon, Julie McEnery and Masanori Ohno report on
behalf of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) collaboration.

Based on an on-ground analysis, the Large Area Telescope (LAT),
on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, detected high energy
emission above 100 MeV, with greater than 10 sigma significance, from
the Swift detected burst GRB 110731A (Oates et al, GCN 12215).

The preliminary LAT location of the ground automated analysis
is (Ra,Dec) = (280.39,-28.53)+/-0.20 d (68% cont.) which is consistent
with the Swift localization and within 0.1d  from the optical
counterpart position.

Further analysis is ongoing.

The Fermi LAT point of contact for this burst is Johan Bregeon
(johan.bregeon@pi.infn.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the
energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of
an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and
many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.
