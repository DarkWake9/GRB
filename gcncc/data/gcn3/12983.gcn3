Using the data set from T-239 to T+326 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120224A (trigger #515976)
(Saxton, et al., GCN Circ. 12980).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 40.937, -17.779 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 43m 44.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 46' 42.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.4 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 29%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows two peaks, the first starting
at ~T-20 sec, peaking at ~T-6 sec.  The second (and stronger peak) 
starts at ~T-3 sec, peaks at ~T+1 sec, and ends at ~T+13 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 8.13 +- 1.99 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.08 to T+8.26 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.25 +- 0.36.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.4 +- 0.5 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
