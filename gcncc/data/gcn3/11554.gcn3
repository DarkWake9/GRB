L.P. Xin, T. M. Zhang, Y.L. Qiu, J.Y. Wei, J. Wang, J.S. Deng, 
C. Wu, X. H. Han on behalf of EAFON report:

We began to observe GRB110112A (stamatikos et al., GCN 11553 ) 
with Xinglong TNT telescope at 10:08:35.375 (UT), 6 hours after 
the burst. 16 images in R-band were obtained with an exposure 
time of 300 sec for each frame. 

After combining all these images, a new marginal source was 
found within the errorbox  of X-ray counterpart 
( stamatikos et al., GCN 11553). 

Its coordinates ( RA and Dec ) are 21:59:43.8 26:27:25.9 (J2000)
with an uncertainty of  about 1 arcsecond.

The brightness of the source is estimated to be about 
19.6 +/- 0.3 mag which is derived from USNO B1.0 R2 mag 
at the mean time of 6.5 hour after the burst. 

Further observations and confirmation are encouraged.
