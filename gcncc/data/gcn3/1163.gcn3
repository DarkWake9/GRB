with P.A. Price, B.P. Schmidt and T.S. Axelrod (RSAA, ANU) report:

We have observed the field of the afterglow of GRB 011121 (GCN #1150)
with the newly-commissioned Infra-Red Imager and Spectrograph (IRIS2)
on the Anglo-Australian Telescope at 2001 Nov 28.7 UT.  Preliminary
reduction of 40 individual 60 sec images in Ks with 1.8 arcsec seeing
reveal a faint source at the position of the afterglow (GCN #1155),
on the outskirts of a galaxy centered approximately 1.5" E and 0.7" S
(ie 9 kpc at z=0.36).  At the resolution and depth of our observations,
we cannot distinguish between this source being distinct from the
galaxy or corresponding to an extension of the galaxy.  We estimate
our limiting magnitude as K = 19.1 mag.
