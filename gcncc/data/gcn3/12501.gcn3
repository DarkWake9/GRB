C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara) reports on behalf of a
large collaboration:

The 2-m Faulkes Telescope North robotically followed
up Swift GRB 111029A (Troja et al. GCN Circ. 12498)
from 09:49:03 UT, corresponding to 263 s after the
BAT trigger time.
Within the XRT error circle we do not find any source
in the R and i' filters down to the following magnitudes:

Mid time from  Total Exp   Filter    Magnitude
trigger (s)    (s)
-------------------------------------------------
  908            120         R > 21.8
1118            100         i' > 20.5
-------------------------------------------------

Magnitudes have been calibrated from R2 and I nominal
values of nearby USNOB1.0 stars.
