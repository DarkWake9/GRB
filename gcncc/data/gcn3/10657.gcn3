J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), C. Zurita (IAC),  A. de Ugarte Postigo (INAF- 
OAB),  on behalf of a larger collaboration report:

"We have observed the field of Swift trigger 420256 (Hoversten et al.,  
GCNC 10654) with the 80-cm IAC80 telescope on the observatory of  
Teide, Tenerife, Spain. The observations were conducted in the R-band  
on April 23.1453-23.1906 UT (0.75-1.84 hours post burst) with a total  
exposure  time of 3000s.

Visual comparison to the DSS reveals no new sources in the co-added  
image within the Swift/BAT error circle brighter than R=19 (USNO-B1.0  
calibration)."
