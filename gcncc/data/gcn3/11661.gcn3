GRB110205A:  CARMA 3mm Observations

Ashley Zauderer, Edo Berger (Harvard) and Dale Frail (NRAO) report:

We observed GRB110205A (GCN 11629) with CARMA at 3 mm (93 GHz) starting 
2.1 hours after the burst for a total on-source time of 2.3 hours.  No 
millimeter emission is detected in coincidence with the optical 
afterglow position (GCN 11629) to a 3-sigma limit of 0.6 mJy.

We thank the CARMA observatory staff for support of these observations.
