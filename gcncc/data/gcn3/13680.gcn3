C. Pagani (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

At 22:41:45 UT, August 17, 2012, Swift began a Target of Opportunity observation of GRB 120817B (Golenetskii et al. GCN 13670).

We have analysed 2.8 ks of XRT data, beginning 67 ks after the GRB trigger. The data are entirely in Photon Counting mode. No new source is detected in the XRT data. The 3-sigma upper limit is 0.005 counts/sec which is 2.7e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for a typical GRB spectrum.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
