Using the data set from T-240 to T+962 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120211A (trigger #514586)
(Sonbas, et al., GCN Circ. 12920).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 87.781, -24.795 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  05h 51m 07.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -24d 47' 43.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.1 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 64%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows 2 or 3 overlapping peaks starting
at ~T-10 sec, peaking at ~T+42 sec, and ending at ~T+140 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 61.7 +- 6.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-2.34 to T+64.10 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.50 +- 0.22.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 8.1 +- 1.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+40.97 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
