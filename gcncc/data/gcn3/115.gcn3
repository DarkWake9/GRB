K. Hurley, Space Sciences Laboratory, on behalf of the Ulysses
Gamma-Ray Burst Team and C. Kouveliotou, USRA, M. Kippen, P. Woods, UAH,
on behalf of the Gamma-Ray Observatory BATSE team, report:

"We have obtained a refined IPN annulus for this soft gamma repeater (IAUC
6944 and GCN 110).  Its center is at (equinox 2000.0) R.A. = 22h01m40s,
Decl. = -10o09'.8, and its radius is 76.769 +/- 0.028 deg.  This annulus
is contained within the previous one.  Considerable further refinement
of this position is possible.  An image may be found at
