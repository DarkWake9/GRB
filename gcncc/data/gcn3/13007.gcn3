Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120305A (trigger #516997)
(Stratta, et al., GCN Circ. 13004).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 47.549, 28.495 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 10m 11.8s 
   Dec(J2000) = +28d 29' 41.2" 
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 92%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single FRED-like spike starting
at ~T+0.00 sec, peaking at ~T+0.02 sec, and returning to baseline
at ~T+0.20 sec.  At the ~2-sigma level, there is possible emission out to ~T+20 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.10 +- 0.02 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T+0.00 to T+0.136 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.00 +- 0.09.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.0 +- 0.1 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.43 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
