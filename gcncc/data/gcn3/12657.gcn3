SUBJECT: GRB 111210A: Gemini-North candidate counterpart
DATE:    11/12/11 00:42:50 GMT

N. R. Tanvir (U. Leicester) and A. J. Levan (U. Warwick) report on
behalf of a larger collaboration:

We obtained short exposures of the field of GRB 111210A (Siegel et
al. GCN 12650) with Gemini-North using the GMOS instrument,
beginning at 2011-Dec-10 15:16UT, approximately 39 minutes post-burst. 
Within the refined XRT position (Goad et al. GCN12652) we find a faint
source which is visible in both z and r filters.  Calibrated against nearby
USNO stars we find a magnitude of r~23, with an estimated error
of +/-0.2 random and +/-0.3 calibration.

Our astrometry gives a position (conservative uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec) of:

RA(2000)= 12 45 54.40
dec(2000)= -07 09 57.4

We thank the Gemini staff, particularly Kristin Chiboucas and
Rachel Mason, for assistance with these observations.
