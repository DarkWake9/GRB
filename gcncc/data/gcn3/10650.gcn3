Poonam Chandra (RMC) and Dale A. Frail (NRAO)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We used the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) to observe the Swift GRB
100418A (Marshall et al., GCN 10612) on 2010 Apr 21 UT.

We detect the GRB afterglow with a flux density of 458 +/- 20 uJy
at the GROND optical afterglow position (Filgas et al, GCN 10617).

The EVLA is undergoing active commissioning and as such these results
should be considered preliminary. Further observations are planned.
