Using the data set from T-60 to T+123 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT short GRB 110112A (trigger #442039)
(Stamatikos, et al., GCN Circ. 11553).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 329.936, 26.470 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 59m 44.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +26d 28' 10.6" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 87%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a single spike starting at ~T-0.1 sec
and ending at ~T+0.5 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.5 +- 0.1 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.1 to T+0.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.14 +- 0.46.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.0 +- 0.9 x 10^-8 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.28 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
