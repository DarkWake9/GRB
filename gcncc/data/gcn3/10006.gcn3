R. Margutti (INAF-OAB) &  C. Guidorzi (U. Ferrara) report on behalf
of the Swift XRT team:

We have analyzed the first orbit data (1.8 ks exposure) of the
Swift ToO observation of the SuperAGILE detected (Donnarumma et al.,
GCN Circ. 10004; Feroci, GCN Circ 10005) burst GRB 091010.

The Swift observation started on 2009 Oct 10 at 14:48:26 UT, about
43 ks after the SuperAGILE trigger.
We detected a single, uncatalogued X-ray source within the SuperAGILE
error box at RA, Dec =298.6661, -22.5181 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000):  19h54m39.86s
Dec (J2000): -22:31:05.2

with an uncertainty of 4.3 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).
The source lies 72 arcsec from the SuperAGILE position.

The source has a count rate of about 5.7E-02 count s^-1.
At the moment it is not possible to determine whether the source is
fading given the current statistics.

Burst Advocate for this burst is R. Margutti
(raffaella.margutti AT brera.inaf.it).
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
