TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13362
SUBJECT: GRB 120612A: Swift/UVOT observations
DATE:    12/06/12 18:08:11 GMT
FROM:    Craig Swenson at PSU/Swift  <cswenson@astro.psu.edu>

C.A. Swenson (PSU) and C. Pagani (U Leicester) report on
behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB
120612A 148 s after the BAT trigger (Pagani et al., GCN Circ.
13357).  No new optical afterglow consistent with the XRT posistion
(Evans et al., GCN Circ. 13359) is detected in the initial UVOT
exposures.

We note that there is a DSS source, which complicates the UVOT
analysis, located at RA, DEC = 126.72113, -17.57439.  This source
lies 3.05 arcsec from the XRT position and may or may not be related
to GRB 120612A, though we see no sign of variability in the source
in the first 1500 s of UVOT observations.  The source is also listed
in the USNOB catalog with a color of (B-R) = 0.728, corrected for
Galactic reddening.

Follow-up observations are encouraged to determine a redshift for
the DSS source to determine whether this is potentially the host galaxy.
