report on behalf of the TAO project team:

We observed GRB 101023A (Saxton et al., GCN 11363) with
the near-infrared camera ANIR mounted on the miniTAO 1.0m
telescope at the University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory
on the summit of Co. Chajnantor (5640m altitude) in
the northern Chile.

The J-, H-, and Ks-band observations started from
2010-10-24 02:48 UT (3hours after the burst), and total
exposure time was 540sec for each band. The afterglow was
detected in all the three bands at the position reported
by Levan et al. (GCN 11366). The seeing was 0.9-1.0arcsec
throughout the observations, and the image of the afterglow
was clearly separated from the nearby bright star.

AB magnitudes are are listed below, where the flux calibrations
were carried out using 2MASS stars within the FoV.

Band   Mid-UT    AB-Mag
----------------------------
Ks      02:53:05  19.40 +/- 0.10
H       03:07:41  20.28 +/- 0.27
J       03:24:36  19.92 +/- 0.14
