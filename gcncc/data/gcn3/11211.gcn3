A. de Ugarte Postigo (DARK/NBI),  S. Martin Ruiz (ESO),
G. Petitpas (SMA), and A. J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC)
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We have observed the field of GRB 100901A (Immler et al.
GCNC 11159) from SMA in the 345 GHz band starting on
September 3rd at 9 UT (43.5 h after the burst). The
observing conditions were very good, with a water vapour
of PWV~1 mm. However, preliminary analysis does not show
any new source at the position of the afterglow down to
a 3-sigma limit of 2.25 mJy."
