J. R. Cummings (NASA/GSFC/UMBC), N. Gehrels (NASA/GSFC),
H. A. Krimm (NASA/GSFC/USRA), D. M. Palmer (LANL) report on
behalf of the Swift Team:

At 11:15:19UT, BAT detected GRB 100115A during a preplanned Swift
slew maneuver. A source was found in ground analysis of event data
collected for the BAT Slew Survey at RA, Dec 3.333, -0.817, which is

RA (J2000) 00 13 19.9
Dec (J2000) -00 49 01

with an estimated 90% containment uncertainty of 4 arcmin radius.

The burst was a single FRED pulse with a T90 of about 3 seconds.
There was no detectable flux above 100 keV.

A Swift TOO has been approved.
