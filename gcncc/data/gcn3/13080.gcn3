report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of GRB 120320A (Markwardt et al., GCNC 13071),
detected by Swift/BAT, with the 0.6m BOOTES-4/MET telescope at the Lijiang
Astronomical Observatory, China. Unfiltered images were obtained
starting 13:48:44UT at high airmass (2h12m after the burst, limited by the
local horizon). The resulting limiting magnitude (63 x 180s) is 16.3 when
calibrated with the R1Mag value of USNO-B1.0 catalogue stars."
