 We observed the central part of the error region of GRB011212 (GCN
#1194) with the Gunma Astronomical Observatory's 150-cm telescope.
Starting at 2001 December 12.547 UT, five 120-s exposures were made
(last two were affected by a cloud) in R band at a square region
within the four corners of (R.A., Dec.) = (04:59:35.5, +32:03:19),
(04:59:43.6, +32:13:52), (05:00:33.4, +32:12:09), and (05:00:25.3,
+32:01:36) (J2000). Five 120-s exposures were made at the same
position from 2001 December 13.545 UT as well as other two fields,
which covered the entire HETE + RXTE/ASM joint error region except for
a small southernmost part (Decl. < +31:57:20). Combined images of each
pointing were as deep as DPOSS plate limit. Comparison with the DPOSS
image did not show an optical afterglow candidate brighter than 20.5R
mag.
