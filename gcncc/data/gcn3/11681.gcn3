E. Berger, W. Fong (Harvard), and J. Mulchaey (OCIW) report:

"We inspected our Magellan/LDSS3 r- and i-band images (GCN #11676) at the
location of the refined XRT error circle (GCN #11678). We detect a single
point source in coincidence with the new XRT position in both filters.  The
position of the optical source is (J2000):

RA = 01:29:50.86
DEC = -20:35:33.5

with an uncertainty of about 0.3" in each coordinate.  The i-band magnitude
is about 21.8 mag.  At present we do not have any evidence
for fading of this source."
