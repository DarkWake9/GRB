A. Henden and P. Nelson (Ellinbank Observatory, Australia)
on behalf of the AAVSO International GRB Network, report:

The Ellinbank 320mm f/5 Newtonian with an ST-8E CCD were used on 020321 UT
to image the BeppoSAX WFC error circle for GRB020321
(Gandolfi, GCN 1281; Guidorzi et al., GCN 1284).
A total of 30 x 30 sec images in Rc were taken from 12:22 to 12:47 UT
(8.2hrs after the burst), covering a 20x30 arcmin field that
includes the entire BeppoSAX error circle.

The ESO R and AAO R plate scans from the USNO PMM pixel database
were used to blink the resultant coadded image.  The limiting
magnitude is estimated to be Rc=19.  Two faint objects, near the
limiting magnitude, do not appear on the ESO or AAO plates, and
are not included in the minor planet database.  These two objects
are at:
    16:11:30.00  -83:39:12.1  J2000
    16:12:52.00  -83:40:13.9

with position errors of about 0.5arcsec.  These may be artifacts
of the processing, but are the only objects inside of the WFC error
circle that do not also appear on the photographic plates.  In particular,
we find nothing new at our limiting magnitude inside the recent
NFI error circle (Gandolfi, GCN 1285).

The AAVSO would like to thank the Curry Foundation for supporting the
AAVSO International GRB Network.
