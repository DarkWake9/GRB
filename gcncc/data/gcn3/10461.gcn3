GRB 1000302A : A possible afterglow candidate

K.Y. Huang (ASIAA), H.Y. Hsiao, and Y. Urata (NCU)
on behalf of the EAFON team.

We took several R and I band images for the GRB 1000302A field
(Cummings et al. GCN 10458) with Lulin 1-m telescope in Taiwan.
The observations started at 16 mins after the bursts. Our R-band
combined image (300sx5) shows a marginal source (R~ 21) in the XRT error
circle. However, the source is clearly detected (I~ 19.9) in our
single I(300s)-band image taken around 44 mins after the burst.

No observations will be made with LOT becasue of morning
twilight. Further deep observations are encouraged to confirm
variability of this candidate. The brightness of the
candidate were calibrated with a nearby USNOB star.
