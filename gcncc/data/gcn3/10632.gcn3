TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR

SUBJECT: GRB 100414A: Confirmation of the X-ray afterglow

K.L. Page (U. Leicester) and J.K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC) report on behalf of the 
Swift-XRT team:

A second Swift-XRT observation of the Fermi-detected GRB 100414A (GCN 
Circs 10594 and 10595) was performed on 2001-04-19, 5.7 days after the 
trigger. The source reported by Page et al. (GCN Circs 10601, 10605) is no 
longer detected, with a 3-sigma upper limit on the count rate of 4.5x10^-3 
count s^-1 (corresponding to an observed flux of 2.5x10^-13 erg cm^-2 
s^-1). This non-detection sets a lower limit on the decay slope of alpha > 
1.5.

With this fading, we can confirm that this source is the X-ray afterglow of GRB 
100414A.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
