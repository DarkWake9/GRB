We reobserved the entire 90% confidence RXTE_ASM localization
of GRB971024 (Trigger No. 6448, GCN notice of 24 Oct 97 22:41:47 UT)
with the USNO, Flagstaff Station 1.0-m telescope in the R band, 48 hours
after our first set of observations (which were obtained 14-14.5 hours
after the GRB event).  The two sets of frames (both approximately as deep as
the DSS in this region) were blinked against each other.  No significantly
variable objects (approx.  1 mag) were detected to approximately R = 19
(in our previous notice, the first set of frames were blinked against DSS,
and no significantly brighter objects in our frames were found).
