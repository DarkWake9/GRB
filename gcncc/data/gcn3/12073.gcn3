"At 15:21:32.549 UT on 10 June 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110610A (trigger 329412094 / 110610640),
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Marshall et al. 2011, GCN 12065).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
This burst was also detected by INTEGRAL SPI-ACS and Suzaku WAM.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 40 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0.0 s to T0+39.4 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.97 +/- 0.05 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 189.9 +/- 14.0 keV.
The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(8.70 +/- 0.35)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+33.7 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 5.97 +/- 0.25 ph/s/cm^2.

A Band function fits the spectrum equally well with
Epeak = 170.0 +/- 19.8 keV, alpha = -0.93 +/- 0.07
and beta = -2.23 +/- 0.20.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
