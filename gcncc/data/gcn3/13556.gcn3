L. Elenin (KIAM), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko (IKI) report on behalf of 
larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 120802A (Holland et al., GCN 13555) with 
0.45-m telescope Ïf ISON-NM observatory  starting on  Aug. 02 (UT) 08:13:18, 
i.e. 12.5 minutes after burst  trigger.  We took  several unfiltered images 
of 30 s exposure.  We do not detect any source within XRT error circle 
(Holland et al., GCN 13555) in any co-added frames.   The preliminary 
photometry of  co-added frames is based  on the USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby 
stars:

T_start,     Exposure, OT,  Upper Limit (3sigma)
