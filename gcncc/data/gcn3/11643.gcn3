  Myungshin Im (CEOU/SNU), and Yuji Urata (NCU) on behalf
  of a larger collaboration

   We are taking images of the field around GRB 110205A (GCN 11629)
  in B and R filters using the 1.0m telescope at Mt. Lemmon, AZ, USA,
  starting at 2011 February 5, 05:19:11 UT (roughly 3.28 hrs
  after the burst alert).

    We clearly identify the afterglow (GCN 11630 et al.) in all the
  image taken so far..
   The first image of the observation shows that the afterglow
  is at R = 18.0 +- 0.1 (Vega), calibrated against a star in the
  USNO B-1 catalog at RA=10:58:34.2 and Dec=+67:31:45.3.

   The observation and the further analysis of the data are
  onging. We thank the LOAO operator, Jae-Hyuck Youn, for his assitance
  of the observation.
