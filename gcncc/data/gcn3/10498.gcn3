report on behalf of the Swift Team:

At 13:37:41 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered
while entering the SAA.  We are almost certain that this is not a GRB
nor anything else astrophysical. 

The XRT began observing the field at 13:39:58.7 UT, 137.2 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Due to the passage of Swift through the SAA no further
data were taken until T+1481 seconds. In 340-s of data obtained after
this time there are no X-ray sources. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter
starting 1481 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate
has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25%
of the BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6
mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of
the BAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18
mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to
E(B-V) of 0.02.
