(YNAO) report:

We observed the field of GRB 111228A (Ukwatta et al., GCN 12737) at the
2.4m Gao-Mei-Gu (GMG) telescope equipped with YFOSC. Observations
started at 16:31:38 UT on 2011-12-28  (i.e., 47 mins after the burst) and 
4x600s R-band images were obtained in a seeing of
~3.36". We found the afterglow was decaying. The results are as follows:
mid time (UT)                            magnitude (err)
 2011-12-28 16:36:38                     17.11 (0.01)  
 2011-12-28 17:19:14                    17.42 (0.01)  
 2011-12-28 17:44:57                    17.56 (0.01)  
 2011-12-28 17:56:15                    17.62 (0.01). 

The magnitudes were calibrated with the USNO-B1 #1083-0199833 star (R2 = 17.28 mag; also
used by Klotz et al., GCN 12746; Nascimbeni et al., GCN 12748; Xu et
al., GCN 12750; Hentunen et al., GCN 12754).

Further observations are planned.

We thank the GMG staff, especially Y.-X. Xin, Fen He, and Gui-Hua He for
performing these observations.
