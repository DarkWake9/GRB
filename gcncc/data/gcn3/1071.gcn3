TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT

SUBJECT: IPN detection of SGR1900+14

K. Hurley, on behalf of the Ulysses GRB team, T. Cline, on behalf
of the Ulysses and Konus - Wind GRB teams, and E. Mazets and S.
Golenetskii, on behalf of the Konus-Wind GRB team, report:

Ulysses and Konus observed a burst on 2001 June 25 at 51801 s UT (Earth
crossing time) whose origin is probably SGR1900+14.  It had a duration
of ~2 s, a 25-100 keV fluence of 2.8 x 10^-6 erg/cm^2, and a peak flux
over 0.25 s of 3.9x10^-6 erg/cm^2 s.  Triangulation gives an annulus
centered at RA(2000), Decl(2000) = 17.530 deg, +33.050 deg, with radius
85.548 +/- 0.027 deg.  The center line of this annulus passes ~0.018
deg from SGR1900+14.  In addition, the Konus data indicate that the
source of this event is located in the north ecliptic hemisphere, which
is consistent with the location of SGR1900+14, and the spectrum of the
burst is soft.  This may signal a resurgence of activity from this
SGR.
