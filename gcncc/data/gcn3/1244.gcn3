TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1244
SUBJECT: SN 2002ap (SN/GRB?)
DATE:    02/02/05 17:55:39 GMT
FROM:    Paul Vreeswijk at U of Amsterdam  <pmv@astro.uva.nl>

P. Vreeswijk (University of Amsterdam) and S. Smartt (Institute of
Astronomy, Cambridge) report that images taken by Gerry Gilmore and
Rosie Wyse on the Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma on Feb. 2.9 UT have
allowed an accurate projection of the position of SN 2002ap on the
pre-discovery images reported in IAUC 7816. Within the new errors,
the SN is not coincident with the V = 21.2 object reported as a
possible progenitor. The difference in position between SN 2002ap and
this object is 1.7 +/- 0.3" where the error is dominated by the error
in the position of the faint object. There is no object in the pre-
discovery images at the SN position, to limiting magnitudes (5-sigma, 
2" aperture radius) of U = 20.8, B = 22.1, V = 22.0, and I = 20.8.
