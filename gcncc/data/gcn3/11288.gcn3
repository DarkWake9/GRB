Swift Team:

At 05:03:25 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 100917A (trigger=434360).  Swift did not slew to the burst
location due to a moon observing constraint. The BAT on-board calculated 
location is RA, Dec 289.265, -17.104 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 19h 17m 04s
   Dec(J2000) = -17d 06' 15"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a weak peak 
with a duration of about 4 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~400 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT position. 
There will thus be no XRT or UVOT data for this trigger. 

This trigger will be in moon constraint until approximately 06:30 UT
 on the 19th of September. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is O. M. Littlejohns (oml2 AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
