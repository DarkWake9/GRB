L. Elenin (KIAM), A. Volnova (SAI MSU), I. Molotov (KIAM), A. Pozanenko 
(IKI) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of  GRB 120811C (Barlow et al., GCN  13622) with 
0.45-m telescope of ISON-NM observatory  starting on  Aug. 12 (UT) 03:25:07. 
We took  several unfiltered images of 30 s exposures.  The optical afterglow 
(Denisenko et al., GCN 13623) is marginally detected in co-added frames at 
coordinates (J2000) 13:18:43.98 +62:18:03.4 with uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec 
in both coordinates.  A preliminary  photometry of co-added frames is based 
on the USNO-B1.0 (R2)  nearby  stars is following:

T_start,     T0+,           Exposure,  OT,              UL (3 sigma)
(UT)           mid, d         (s)

03:25:07   0.5095      1800           21.5 +/-0.5   21.2
