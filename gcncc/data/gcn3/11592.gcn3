A. Goldstein (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 22:21:00.17 UT on 19 January 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110119A (trigger 317168462 / 110119931)which was 
also detected by the Swift/BAT (E. Troja et al. 2011, GCN 11581). The GBM 
on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.  The angle from
the Fermi LAT boresight is 71 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of ~100 s of variable outburst followed
by a small bump ~175 s after T0.  The entire burst has a duration (T90) 
of about 219 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-16.4 s 
to T0+62.5 s is best fit by a Band function with Epeak = 126.3 +/- 16.8 keV, 
alpha = -0.60 +/- 0.13, and beta = -1.95 +/- 0.09
(C-Stat 1348 for 357 d.o.f.).

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(1.36 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+31.4 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.5 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
