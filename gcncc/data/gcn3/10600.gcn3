The full data set for this burst has been downlinked.
Using the data set from T-239 to T+963 sec, we report final analysis
of BAT GRB 100413A (trigger #419404) (Holland, et al, GCN Circ 10581
and Stamatikos, GCN Circ 10585).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 266.223, 15.835 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 44m 53.6s 
   Dec(J2000) = +15d 50' 04.6" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 48%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows multiple overlapping peaks in two main
clusters of peaks.  It starts at ~T-45 sec, with the first cluster ending
at ~T+40 sec.  The second cluster starts around T+90 sec, peaks around T+100 sec,
and ends at ~T+250 sec.  The emission does not return to background
between the two clusters.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 191 +- 14 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-3.4 to T+227.4 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.25 +- 0.07.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.2 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+116.78 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.7 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
