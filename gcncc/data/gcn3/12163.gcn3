C. Pagani, A. P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), J. A. Kennea (PSU) and J. R.
Cummings (GSFC/UMBC) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

We have analysed 584 s of Photon Counting (PC) XRT data for Swift
J1822.3-1606 (Cummings et al. GCN Circ. 12159),  a probable SGR.  The
XRT observations started 1.2 days after the  BAT trigger.

A bright, uncatalogued X-ray source is detected inside the BAT error
circle at RA, Dec 275.5763, -16.0742 which is equivalent to:
  RA(J2000)  = 18h 22m 18.32s
  Dec(J2000) = -16d 04' 27.2"
with an uncertainty of 3.6 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 113 arcseconds from the BAT position.
