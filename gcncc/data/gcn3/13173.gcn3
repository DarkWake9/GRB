S. D. Barthelmy (GSFC) and T. Sakamoto (GSFC/UMBC) 
on behalf of the Swift team:
 
Swift trigger 518853 (reported in GCN 13166) is not due to a new galactic
transient, nor is it a GRB.  This trigger was the result of a large
roll angle error and an on-board misidentification of GX 301-2 as IGR12349-6434.
