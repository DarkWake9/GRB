P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov, D. Svinkin, and T. Cline on behalf
of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short hard GRB 110529A (GBM trigger 328322924, GCN 12044)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=2920.249s UT (00:48:40.249)

The burst light curve consists of a single sharp pulse
with a total duration of ~0.57 s.
The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB110529_T02920/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of (5.1 ± 1.1)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0,
of 7.0(-3.0,+2.2)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 5 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is best fitted
in the 20 keV - 5 MeV range by the GRB (Band)
model, for which:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.43 (-0.36, +0.89),
the high energy photon index beta = -1.7 (-0.3, +0.2),
the peak energy Ep = 428(-226, +363) keV,
chi2 = 14.3/26 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
