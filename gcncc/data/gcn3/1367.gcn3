A.Sergeev (IC AMER, Terskol), S.Karpov (BNO), V.Petkov (BNO),
S.Barabanov (INASAN, Moskow), N.Karpov (IC AMER, Terskol) report:  

     We have obtained R-band images of the error box of GRB 020409
(Piro 2002, GCN 1347) using the IC AMER 2m telescope at peak Terskol and
MPAE two-channel focal reducer. 
Twelve 600s images were taken on 2002 April 10 at 19:33 UT.  The second
epoch three 600s images were taken on 2002 April.   
We find no evidence that any object in the BeppoSAX  error box varies by
more than approximately 0.5 mag  The limiting magnitude of  this search is
approximately R = 22.
