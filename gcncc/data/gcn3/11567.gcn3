O.M. Littlejohns (U. Leicester), M. De Pasquale (MSSL-UCL), and D.C.
Morris (GWU/GSFC) report, on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift XRT and UVOT instruments began observing the field of INTEGRAL
burst GRB 110112B (Mereghetti et al., GCN circ 11562) 55.8 ks after the
burst trigger. No candidate afterglow is detected in the INTEGRAL error
circle.

UVOT and XRT observed the field of view from 55.8 ks until 67.3 ks after
the trigger. UVOT observed in white filter, with a total exposure time
of 3.6 ks. The three sigma upper limit for any new source in the field
of view is 22.2 mag. XRT observations have a total exposure time of 4.9
ks, and yield a three sigma upper limit of 2.0e-3 counts/second for any
new source in the field of view.

This circular is an official product of the Swift Team.
