Using the data set from T-240 to T+302 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100206A (trigger #411412)
(Krimm, et al., GCN Circ. 10376).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 47.168, 13.175 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 08m 40.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +13d 10' 30.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 51%.
 
The mask-weighted light curves a single spike starting at ~T+0.0 and
ending at ~T+0.2 sec.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 0.12 +- 0.03 sec (estimated error
including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-0.008 to T+0.124 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
0.63 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.44 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 1.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
