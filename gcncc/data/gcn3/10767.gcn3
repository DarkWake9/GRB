SUBJECT: GRB 100514A: optical afterglow confirmation

V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI)  report on behalf of larger GRB 
follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 100514A (Markwardt  et al. GCN 10759) 
with Shajn telescope of CrAO between (UT) May 15  00:04:38 and  15T01:10:33 
under good weather conditions and mean seeing of  2 arcsec. Inside the 
enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al. GCN 10762) we detect the object with 
coordinates

RA(J2000):  21 55 17.46
Dec(J2000): +29 09 36.13

with uncertainties of 0.3" in each coordinates.

The photometry of the object based on USNO-B1.0 star 1191-0563318  (J2000) 
RA= 21:55:19.80 Dec= +29:10:10.0  (assuming  R2=19.25)  is following:

T0+      Filter,   Exposure, mag.
(mid, d)              (s)

0.2390   R       57x60     23.2 +/- 0.2

The afterglow candidate reported by Marshall and  Markwardt (GCN 10766) is 
fading by ~2 mag. within 5.7 hours, and hence we confirm the afterglow.
