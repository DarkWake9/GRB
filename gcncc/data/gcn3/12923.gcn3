Kenshi Yanagisawa, Daisuke Kuroda, Yasuhiro Shimizu, Kiichi Okita
(OAO/NAOJ), Michitoshi Yoshida (Hiroshima-U), Kouji Ohta(Kyoto-U),
and Nobuyuki Kawai(Tokyo Tech.) report on behalf of the MITSuME
collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB120211A (Sonbas et al., GCNC 12920) in
Ks-band with a wide-field NIR camera at Okayama  Astrophysical
Observatory (Japan). The camera has an effective aperture of 0.91m.

Observations started from 12:08 UT on 11th Feburuary, 10.1 min after
the BAT trigger, to 13:22 UT.  The total exposure of 60 min was
successfully obtained.

In our co-add image, we did not find any new point source within the
enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al., GCNC 12922) down to limiting
magnitude of  Ks= 15.5(Vega, S/N=3). The photometric calibration was
made against 2MASS field stars.
