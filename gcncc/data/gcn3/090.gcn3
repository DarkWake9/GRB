GRB980519 I-band observations

F. J. Castander, R. Evans, D. E. Reichart, D. Q. Lamb
and W. Wild, University of Chicago, report:

"We made I-band observations of the BeppoSAX WFC error 
circle for GRB980519 (GCN #75) on May 21.34 - 21.36 UT and 
May 22.27 - 22.38 UT, using the 41-inch telescope at Yerkes 
Observatory. On May 21.35, we detected the optical transient 
reported by Jaunsen et al. (GCN #78) at about I = 21.9 mag, 
near the limiting magnitude of the image. On May 22.33, we did 
not detect the optical transient down to an image limiting 
magnituide of I = 21.0 mag. These magnitudes are tied to 
the Bloom et al. (GCN #87) calibration standards.
