At 16:32:28.76 UTC (59548.76 s UT) on 31 March 2002, the HETE FREGATE 
and WXM instruments detected event H1963, a long (~50 sec) GRB. A GCN 
Alert Notice was issued at 16:39:31 UT. A preliminary localization 
was reported as a GCN Position Notice at 17:12:51 UT, ~40 min after 
the burst. The ground analysis has produced a refined location which 
can be expressed as a circle with a 90% confidence radius of 8 
arcminutes centered at:

RA = 13h 16m 22s.7, Dec = -17o 55' 23" (J2000)

In the FREGATE 8-40 keV band, H1963 had a duration of ~20 seconds.  A 
total of 2320 net counts were detected during that interval, 
corresponding to a fluence of ~4 x 10-7 ergs cm-2. The peak flux 
averaged over 0.85 s was ~1 x 10-7 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie 4 x Crab flux). 
In the WXM 2-25 keV band, the localization SNR was >9.
