The long bright GRB 110428A localized by Fermi-LAT (Vasileiou et al.,
GCN 11982) was observed the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) which
covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV at 09:18:30 UT (=T0).

The observed light curve shows double-peaked structure starting at
T0-2s, ending at T0+10 s with a duration (T90) of about 5 seconds. The
fluence in 100 - 1000 keV was 1.31 (-0.43, +2.03) x 10^-5 erg/cm^2.
The 1-s peak flux measured from T0+4 s was
9.91 (-0.34, +1.19) photons/cm^2/s in the same energy range.

Preliminary result shows that the time-averaged spectrum from
T0-2s to T0+10s is well fitted by a power-law with exponential cutoff
model :
dN/dE ~ E^{-alpha} * exp(-(2-alpha)*E/Epeak) with
alpha 1.11 (-0.22, +0.19), and Epeak 195.5 (-14.4, +15.9) keV 
(chi2/d.o.f. = 15.8/20).
All the quoted errors are at statistical 90% confidence level.
