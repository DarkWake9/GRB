The short hard GRB 101219A, (Swift/BAT trigger=440606:
Gelbord, et al., GCN 11461; Krimm et.al, GCN 11467)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=09094.716s UT (02:31:34.716)

The total duration of the burst is ~0.6 s.
The emission is seen up to 10 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB101219_T09094/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of (3.6 ± 0.5)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.032s,
of (2.8 ± 0.8)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the major part of the burst
(from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.22 (-0.25, +0.30),
and Ep = 490(-79, +103) keV, chi2 = 27.6/30 dof.

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+0.064 s) is best fit
in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a power law
with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.05 (-0.45, +0.60),
and Ep = 426(-100, +173) keV, chi2 = 9/10 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
