Dale A. Frail (NRAO) and Poonam Chandra (RMC) report on behalf of a
larger collaboration:

"We used the Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the field of view
towards the Swift burst GRB 091127 (GCN 10197, 10199, 10201) at a
frequency of 8.46 GHz. Data was taken at two epochs: November 29.22
and November 30.21 UT. No radio source was detected at the position of
the optical afterglow with typical 3-sigma upper limits of 300 uJy. A
bright double-radio source in the field makes deeper observations
difficult. No further observations are planned.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities, Inc."
