Using the data set from T-70 to T+22 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110107A (a ground-found burst)
(Cummings, GCN Circ. 11545). 
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows low level multiple overlapping peaks
starting at ~T-70 sec and ending at ~T+22 sec. The event-by-event data captured
during the slew stops at T+22 sec.  Using the on-board raw rates, there is
a weak indication that the burst continued out to ~T+45 sec.  
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-70 to T+22 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.58 +- 0.03.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is at least 
5.8 +- 0.5 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
