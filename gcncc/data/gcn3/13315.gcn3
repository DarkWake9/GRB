of the Konus-Wind team, report:

The short-duration hard GRB 120519A
(IPN localization: Golenetskii at al., GCN 13313)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=62298.004s UT (17:18:18.004)

The light curve shows a series of overlapping pulses
with a total duration of ~1.2 s.
The emission is seen up to ~7.5 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120519_T62298/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.7(-1.1,+1.5)x10-6 erg/cm2,
and a 16-ms peak flux, measured from T0,
of 1.3(-0.4,+0.5)x10-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is well fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.5 (-0.3, +0.3),
and Ep = 740(-240, +450) keV,
chi2 = 22.9/22 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
