M. H. Wieringa (ATNF), E. Berger (Caltech), P. A. Price (Caltech and RSAA,
ANU), S. R. Kulkarni (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report:

"We observed the NFI error circle of GRB 020321 (GCN #1285) for 12 hours
centered on 2002, Mar 21.90 UT with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) at 4.8 and 8.7 GHz.  At 8.7 GHz we detect two possible candidates
within the NFI error circle above a 5-sigma flux density of 190 microJy:

1. RA=16:11:14.2, DEC=-83:41:13.8  (J2000)
2. RA=16:11:27.8, DEC=-83:40:29.5  (J2000)

Further observations at both frequencies are required to establish
variability, and identify one of these sources as the radio afterglow of
GRB 020321.

We have also searched the positions of these radio candidates in the
Magellan/Baade 6.5-m telescope + LDSS2 data from 2002, Mar 22.28 and 23.41
UT (GCN 1305).  We find no sources at these positions down to the limiting
magnitude of R~24 mag."
