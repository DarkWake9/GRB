3 Robotic telescopes MASTER II was pointing to the GRB111215A (Oates et
al., GCN CIRCULAR NUMBER:  12681). Two very wide field cameras
was observed Swift error box before, during and after GRB trigger time.

MASTER II  robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru)
located in Tunka(Siberia) was pointed to the  GRB111215A 26 sec s after
notice time and 381 sec after GRB time at 2011-12-15 14:10:29.44 UT in two  
polarizarions.  On our first (80s exposure) set we haven`t found optical
transient  within SWIFT error-box (ra=23 18 12 dec=+32 28 47 r=0.050000).
  The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 18.8 mag

  MASTER II  robotic telescope
located in MASTER-Amur was pointed to the  GRB111215A 214 sec s after
notice time and 567 sec after GRB time at 2011-12-15 14:13:35.289 UT in
two diagonal  polarizarions. On our first (110s exposure) set we haven`t
found optical transient  within SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 17.5 mag

MASTER II  robotic telescope
located near Kislovodsk was pointed to the  GRB111215A 7655 sec s after
notice time and 8007 sec after GRB time at 2011-12-15 16:17:35.91 UT
(time delay is so long  due to weather conditions). On
our first (180s exposure) set we haven`t found optical transient  within
SWIFT error-box.
The 5-sigma upper limit has been about 18.1 mag

Two   MASTER Very Wide Field Cameras located at Tunka
(D=68 mm, 420 square degrees, 11 Mpx) was observed  GRB error box
with 5 s exposure  befoure, during and after GRB Trigger Time
without time gap between images.

Our unfiltered images are calibrated relative to Tycho stars (V).
The magnitude limit of the each emage is  12.0 m at the edge of FOW.

We do not detect OT.
The video from MASTER VWF cameras is available at

The reduction is continuated.
