S. T. Holland (CRESST/GSFC/USRA) and
G. Stratta (ASDC)
report on the behalf of the Swift UVOT team:

     The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 100614A starting 123 s
after the BAT trigger (Stratta, et al., 2010, GCN Circ. 10837).
Settled observations started at 139 s.  No white observations were
taken due to the presence of the bright A0 star HD 159607 (V = 7.4)
located 11.5 arcmin from the XRT source.  We do not find any new
source, relative to the DSS, USNO-B1.0, or 2MASS at the position of
the XRT afterglow (Osborne, et al. 2010, GCN Circ. 10849).
Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits for detecting a source in the u-band
finding chart, and in the co-added images, using a 2.5 arcsecond
radius circular aperture, are

Filter    T_start   T_stop   Exp(s)      Mag
--------------------------------------------
u (fc)       139      339      246    >21.0

v            445   12,065     1218    >21.4
b            395     7165      549    >21.8
u            139     6960      897    >21.7
uvw1         494   13,145      675    >21.2
uvm2         770   12,970     1102    >21.4
uvw2         421     7365      484    >21.1
--------------------------------------------

The quoted upper limits have not been corrected for the expected
Galactic extinction along the line of sight corresponding to a
reddening of E_{B-V} = 0.03 mag (Schlegel, et al., 1998, ApJS, 500,
525).  All photometry is on the UVOT photometry system described in
Poole et al. (2008, MNRAS, 383, 627).
