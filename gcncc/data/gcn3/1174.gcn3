D. W. Fox and P. A. Price (Caltech), with S. S. Eikenberry (Cornell),
report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the HETE-II error circle for XRF011130 (GCN 1169) with
the Palomar Hale Telescope + Wide-Field Infrared Camera during an
instrument commissioning run on December 1.39 UT.  Preliminary
reduction of a subset of the data covering the location of the VLA
source at RA 03:05:24.71, Dec +3:46:13.1 (J2000; uncertainties 1.1" in
each coordinate; see GCN 1173) reveals no K'-band counterpart to a
limit of roughly K'=18.5 mag.  We note also the absence of any optical
counterpart to the VLA source in archival DPOSS images (limits of
approximately g=20.5 mag, r=20.7 mag, and i=20.3 mag) and in our Dec
1.24 UT NEAT images (limit of R=18.5 mag; see GCN 1170)."
