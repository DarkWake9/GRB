Adria C. Updike, Dieter H. Hartmann (Clemson University), and Chris De
Pree (Agnes Scott College) report:

We re-observed the field of GRB 100418A (Marshall et al., GCN 10612) using
the 0.9m SARA telescope located at KPNO beginning 1.44 days after the
trigger.  Observations consisted of 40 minutes in the R band.  We detect
the afterglow (Filgas et al., GCN 10617) at R = 19.3 +/- 0.1, fading 1.0
mag from our previous detection (upon comparison to USNO B1.0 catalog
field stars).  Further observations are planned.
