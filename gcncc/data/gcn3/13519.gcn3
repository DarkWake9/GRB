We observed the location of GRB 120724A (D'Avanzo et al., GCN Circ.
13510) using the SCUBA-2 sub-millimeter continuum camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  The observation started at 07:48 UT on
2012-07-24, corresponding to 69 minutes after the burst trigger.
Exposures totaling 1.7 hours were made in reasonable weather conditions.
No source was detected, with a preliminary RMS of 3.3 mJy/beam at 
850 microns.

We thank Jeff Cox and Antonio Chrysostomou for their prompt support of 
these observations.
