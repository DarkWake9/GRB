R.J. Smith (Liverpool), A Melandri (INAF-OAB), N. Tanvir (Leicester), C.G. Mundell (Liverpool) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

The 2-m Liverpool Telescope followed up GRB110520A (SWIFT trigger 453747; De Pasquale et al. GCN 12020) and obtained a 1200sec r' integration centred 1.36 hours after the SWIFT burst time.
We do not detect any optical transient to a 3 sigma detection limit of R > 23.5, based on comparison to nearby USNO-B catalogue stars.

No further observations are planned.
