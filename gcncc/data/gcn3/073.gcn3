Marco Feroci and Jean in 't Zand 
on behalf of the BeppoSAX Mission Scientist report:

The BeppoSAX-WFC position of GRB980515 has been revised using the
Final Observing Tape.

The revised burst position is:

R.A. = 319.3527 (21h 17m 25s), Decl. = -67.2550 (-67o 15' 18") Eq. 2000.0

We give an error radius of 4 arcmin.  This is somewhat larger than the usual
3 arcmin because of low statistics of the burst.
This position lies at 3.8 arcmin from the latest distributed position,
and 2.6 arcmin from the first distributed position.
