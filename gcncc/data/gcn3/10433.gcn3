J. S. Bloom (UC Berkeley) and P.  E. Nugent (LBNL) report:

"We co-added 27 archival images from the DeepSky* project at Palomar Observatory covering the field of GRB 100219A (Rowlinson et al. 2010, GCN Circ. 10430). The images were obtained between 2004-2007 from the Palomar-Quest Consortium at the Oschin Schmidt telescope.  The limiting magnitude of the stack is approximately R ~ 22.5 mag.

In the combined image we detect a faint (R = 21.0 +/- 0.3 mag relative to nearby USNO catalog stars) slightly extended source, outside the current XRT error circle to the North by ~3.7".  The approximate (+/- 1") coordinates of the source are:

RA = 10:16:48.52, DEC = -12:33:57.5  (J2000)

Within the errors, this is coincident with the UVOT source reported by Holland et al. (GCN 10432). This is a potential (lowish redshift) host candidate of the event and we encourage spectroscopic follow-up."
