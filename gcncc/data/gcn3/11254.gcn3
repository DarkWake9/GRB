The optical counterpart of GRB 100906A (GCN 11227) was observed with
Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National
Observatory, Turkey), starting at Sep 06, 19:28 UT, i.e. ~5.64 hours after
the burst, using TFOSC.

Three series of BRI frames were made under moderate weather conditions. The
afterglow is clearly detected in all images.

Assuming the star at RA = 01:54:46.82, Dec. = +55:37:55.3 to have USNOB1.0
R2MAG = 15.70, we estimated the following magnitudes for the OT on combined
images of every set:

 t-t0     band   mag   err	
 6.048 h    R   18.80  0.02
 9.610 h    R   19.08  0.02
13.554 h    R   19.69  0.04

The color of the afterglow changes from (B-R)=1.21 to (B-R)=1.31 at the
beniginning and at the end of our observations.
