on behalf of EAFON report

"We made a further optical afterglow observation with r'-band using
the Lulin 1m telescope. The stacked image made from 7 frames with 600s
exposure shows the afterglow clearly.  The brightness calibrated
against with the SDSS catalog is r'=22.49+/-0.12 at 1.53 days after
the burst. This is consistent with the extrapolation of the simple
power-law decay with the temporal index of about 1.9 from our previous
report (GCN 11648)."
