Malesani (DARK/NBI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have observed the field of the AGILE GRB 110915B (Del Monte et al. GCNC
12341) using the 1.5m OSN telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory (Granada,
Spain). The observation consisted of 46 x 120s exposures in R-band. In the
combined exposure we detect an uncatalogued source inside the error box of
the XRT afterglow candidate (D'Avanzo et al. GCNC 12348) at the following
coordinates (J2000, +/- 0.5"):

R.A.: 05:10:13.14
Dec.: +01:55:59.1

The preliminary magnitude of the object at an average epoch of Sep. 16.166
UT (9.59 hr after the burst onset) is R = 22.8+/-0.30, as compared to the
USNO-B1.0 star at coordinates 05:10:09.720, +01:56:40.12, for which we
assume R = 17.61.

Further analysis is ongoing.
