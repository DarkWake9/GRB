A. Volnova (SAI MSU), A. Pozanenko (IKI), B. Satovski (Astrotel), M.
Ibrahimov (MAO) report on behalf of  larger GRB  follow-up
collaboration:

We observed the field of the Swift GRB 100725B (Baumgartner et al.,
GCN 10983) with AZT-22 telescope of  Maidanak observatory in R-band on
Jul.25 between (UT) 16:36:55 - 17:51:54 under good waether conditions
(seeing 0.7"). We took 9 images with exposure 300 seconds. We do not
detect any sources in enhanced XRT error circle (Goad et al. GCN
10986). The upper limit (3 sigma) of stacked image is based on
SDSS-DR7 is the following:

t-t0,d	filter	exp., 	uplim
0.24295	R	9x300	22.7
