team, report:

The long-duration GRB 120716A has been observed by Fermi (GBM: trigger
364151106), Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Suzaku (WAM), and MESSENGER
(GRNS), so far, at about 61504 s UT (17:05:04).

The burst light curve shows a short initial pulse followed in ~170 s
period of quiescence by two long pulses with a total duration of ~60 s.

We have triangulated both emission episodes and have revealed that they
came from the same direction.

We have localized the burst to a preliminary, 3 sigma error box whose
coordinates are:
    ---------------------------------------------
    RA(2000), deg                 Dec(2000), deg
   ---------------------------------------------
   Center:
    313.089 (20h 52m 21s)  +9.558 ( +9d 33' 28")
   Corners:
    311.595 (20h 46m 23s)  +9.913 ( +9d 54' 46")
    313.791 (20h 55m 10s) +10.049 (+10d 02' 56")
    314.615 (20h 58m 28s)  +9.110 ( +9d 06' 36")
    312.407 (20h 49m 38s)  +9.046 ( +9d 02' 45")
   ---------------------------------------------
The error box area is 2.04 sq. deg, and its maximum dimension is 3.1 deg.

This box can be improved.

The time history and spectrum will be given in a forthcoming GCN Circular.
