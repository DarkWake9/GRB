of the Swift Team:

At 01:05:23 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 120403A (trigger=519211).  Swift did not slew because
of the Sun observering constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 42.459, +40.466 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  02h 49m 50s
   Dec(J2000) = +40d 27' 57"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
with a duration of about 2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~2200 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to a Sun observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT
position until 18:44 UT on 2012 June 25. There will thus be no XRT or
UVOT data for this trigger before this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is A. P. Beardmore (apb AT star.le.ac.uk). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
