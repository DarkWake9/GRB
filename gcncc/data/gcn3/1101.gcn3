TITLE:   GCN GRB OBSERVATION REPORT
NUMBER:  1101
SUBJECT: GRB010921, negative optical observations
DATE:    01/09/22 19:14:47 GMT
FROM:    Arne A. Henden at USNO/USRA  <aah@nofs.navy.mil>

A. Henden (USRA/USNO) reports on behalf of the USNO GRB team:

We have acquired single R-band images with the NOFS 1.0m
telescope from 010922 0654-0807 UT, forming a mosaic that
covers nearly all of the HETE/IPN error box (GCN 1097).

Inspecting the DPOSS images posted by Fox, et al. (GCN 1098),
this region shows a few galaxies, but also a fair amount
of nebulosity and bright stars.  It is located at galactic
longitude 100.5 and latitude -16.8, so not very far out of
the galactic plane.  At the same time, the star colors 
(Henden GCN 1100) indicate that there is not a great deal
of reddening in the field.

In agreement with Fox, et al. (GCN 1099), we find no obvious
afterglow candidate down to the DPOSS plate limit.  There are
several probable variable stars and a couple of faint high proper
motion objects.
