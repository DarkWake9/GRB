P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), J. K. Cannizzo (NASA/UMBC), P.A. Evans and M.R. Goad
(U. Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

Swift continued to monitor the field of the AGILE-detected GRB 110915B
(Del Monte et al. GCN Circ. 12341).
We have analysed 6.1 ks of XRT data, from 36.8 ks to 442.2 ks after the
AGILE trigger. The data comprise 148 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode with
the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode.

The X-ray source reported in D'Avanzo et al. (GCN Circ. 12348) has faded
to a level of 5.8e-3 ct/sec. The light curve can be modelled with a
power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.05 (+0.57, -0.25).


The results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at
http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00020185.

This circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.
