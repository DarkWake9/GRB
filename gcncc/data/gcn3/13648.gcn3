TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  13648
SUBJECT: GRB 120815A: GROND afterglow candidate

V. Sudilovsky (MPE Garching), D. A. Kann (TLS Tautenburg) and J. Greiner
(MPE Garching) report on behalf of the GROND team:

We observed the field of GRB 120815A (Swift trigger 531003; Pagani
et al., GCN 13645) simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHKs with GROND (Greiner et al.
2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla
Observatory (Chile). Observations started 150 seconds after the BAT
trigger, and were obtained at airmass 1.1 and a mean seeing of 1".3.

Based on exposures of 142 seconds in g'r'i'z' and 240 seconds in JHK
centered 348 seconds after the trigger, we detect an uncataloged source in
all bands at

RA (J2000): 18:15:49.82
DEC (J2000): -52:07:52.1

with an uncertainty of 0.3".

This position is close to the Swift XRT position (J. A. Kennea et al., 
GCN 13647).

We measure a preliminary magnitude:

i' ~ 17.6

The magnitudes are derived based on GROND zeropoints (g'r'i'z') and 2MASS
stars (JHK).
