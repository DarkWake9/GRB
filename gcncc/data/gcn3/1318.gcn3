D. H. Hartmann (Clemson University)

reports on behalf of the SARA consortium GRB Team: 

We imaged the error-circle of GRB020331 (Ricker et al., GCN1315)
with the SARA 0.9m telescope at KPNO, starting at 02/04/01-05:25UT.
Two sets of ten R-band and ten I-band images were taken with 3 min
exposure centered on two positions:

RA, DEC (J2000) = 13:16:22.7, -17:55:23
RA, DEC (J2000) = 13:16:42.4, -17:55:23

Comparison with the Digitised Sky Survey red plates suggests a limiting
magnitude of R ~ 19 for each of the individual exposures.
