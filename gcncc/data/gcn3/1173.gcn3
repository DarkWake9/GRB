E. Berger (Caltech) and D. A. Frail (NRAO) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

"On December 3.73 UT we used the VLA to observe the HETE-II error circle
of GRB011130 (GCN #1169), using five pointings at 4.86 GHz.  Inside the
error circle we find one source which is not cataloged in the NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS was taken at 1.43 GHz; Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693),
with a flux density of 320+/-40 microJy.  The coordinates of this source
are: RA=03 05 24.71, DEC=03 46 13.1 (J2000), with an estimated uncertainty
of 1.1" in each coordinate.  Further observations are planned."
