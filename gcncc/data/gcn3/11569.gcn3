Valerie Connaughton (UAH) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 22:24:55.28 UT on 12 January 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110112B (trigger 316563897 / 110112934),
which was also detected by INTEGRAL IBAS in the IBIS/ISGRI data
(Mereghetti 2011, GCN 11562).

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single forked peak lasting
about 0.256 s.

The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.064 s to T0+0.192 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.72 ± 0.20 and
the cutoff energy, parametrized as Epeak, is 495 ± 196 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.53 ± 0.49)E-07 erg/cm2.  The 64 ms peak photon flux
measured starting from T0-0.064 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 8.7 ± 1.0 ph/s/cm2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
