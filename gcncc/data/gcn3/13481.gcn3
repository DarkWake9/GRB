Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 120714B (trigger #526642)
(Saxton, et al., GCN Circ. 13471).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 355.412, -46.196 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 41m 38.9s 
   Dec(J2000) = -46d 11' 47.3" 
with an uncertainty of 2.6 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 92%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad peak starting at ~T-35 sec,
peaking around T+0 sec, and ending at ~T+55 sec with a tail out to ~T+150 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 159 +- 34 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-23.0 to T+154.0 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.52 +- 0.17.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.1 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-21.71 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
