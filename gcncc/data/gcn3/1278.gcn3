team, Astronomical Institute of the Academy of
Sciences of the Czech Republic, Ondrejov, report:

Wide Field Camera of the BART robotic telescope (FOV
4.8 deg) observed the entire error box of GRB020317.

Following the GRB alert at March 17.760780 UT, the
device has taken a series of images of the area defined
by HETE for trigger 1959.

Exposures started at March 17.8009 (57.8 min after the
burst and 5.2 min after the GCN notice was generated)
and ended at  March 18.1715. Total exposure time is 252
minutes.

Poor weather conditions allowed an unfiltered single image
wide field limiting magnitude 14. We have no positive
OT detections within this range, except for one
suspicious object on the noise level detected on a sum of
first 10 images (lim mag 15.5) at coordinates

        RA 10:23:25     Dec +12:51:36   J2000

Position error is about 17 arcseconds. Nature and
likelihood of reality of the detection are uncertain.
