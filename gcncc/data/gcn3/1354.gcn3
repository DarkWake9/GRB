BeppoSAX ALERT: possible GRB020411

On Apr. 11, 01:49:05 UT a further possible GRB has been
detected in BeppoSAX WFC1. Unfortunately GRBM was again switched off at
that time. A Quick Look analysis seems to confirm the X-ray Flash or GRB
nature of the event.

Preliminary coordinates are:

R.A.(2000)= 78.111
DEC.(2000)= 68.257

The error radius  is 5'.
