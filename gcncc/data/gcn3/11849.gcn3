Guy Pooley (University of Cambridge) reports:

The unusual source GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (GCNs 11823,
11824) was observed with the AMI large array at MRAO, Cambridge (UK) on
2011 Mar 31 over a frequency band from 13.5 to 17.25 GHz.

The first observation ran from 02h07m to 08h06m UT; the weather
conditions were poor. This observation started 2d13h after the first BAT
trigger. The source reported in GCNs 11836, 11848 was detected with a
mean flux density of 2.95 +- 0.30 mJy.
Analysis of the data in 4 equal time divisions shows a steady increase
(2.25, 2.48, 2.56, 3.46 mJy), and a spectral analysis shows a rising
spectrum.

A second observation from 09h01m to 10h17m UT gives a mean flux density
of 2.75 +- 0.30 mJy and also suggests a rising spectrum.

This message is quotable in publications.
