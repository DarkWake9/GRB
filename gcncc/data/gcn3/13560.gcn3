Arne Rau (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 10:56:12.67  UT on 29 July 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120729A (trigger 365252175  / 120729456)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Ukwatta et al. 2012, GCN 13530).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 83 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a single pulse with a duration (T90) of about 25 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-3.6 s to T0+17.9 s is
best fit by a simple power law function with index -1.49 +/- 0.05.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(5.1 +/- 0.1)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+1.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.2 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
