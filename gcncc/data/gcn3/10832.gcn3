Ralph Martin (Perth Observatory) report:

We observed the field of Swift GRB100418a (GCN 10612, GCN 10614, GCN 10616) at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between 12:30:00 UT and 19:30:00 UT on May 26, 2010.

We clearly detected the radio afterglow at the optical afterglow position of the GRB 100418a (GCN 10616) at both frequencies with flux densities 0.91 +/- 0.04 mJy and 1.46 +/- 0.07 mJy respectively. 

Further observations are planned.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (/ Parkes telescope / Mopra telescope / Long Baseline Array) is part of the Australia Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
