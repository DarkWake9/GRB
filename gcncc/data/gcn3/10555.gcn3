S.Mereghetti, A. Paizis, (IASF- Milano), D.Gotz (CES-Saclay), E.  Bozzo, 
C. Ferrigno, M. Beck (ISDC, Versoix), and J. Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on 
behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a long GRB has been detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data at 00:30:30 UT of 
March 31. The refined coordinates (J200) are

RA: 261.0831 [degrees] 
DEC: -58.943 [degrees]

with an uncertainty of 2.5 arcmin

The lightcurve shows a single peak lastiing about 15 s. A preliminary 
analysis gives a 20-200 keV fluence of 4 10e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak flux of 
0.5 ph/cm2/s (1 sec bin).

A plot of the light curve will be posted at
