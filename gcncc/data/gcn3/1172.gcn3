We have successfully performed a follow-up observation of GRB011121 with
BeppoSAX starting on Nov.22, 16.01 UT. This is the first TOO (Target of
Opportunity) observation of a GRB after the new gyroless mode was
installed in October and being tested.
 
We have detected the fading X-ray afterglow of GRB011121 with NFI (1SAX
J113426-7601.4) at a position RA(2000)= 11h34m25.8s, Decl(2000)=-76 01'
22", with an error radius of 50". This position is 25" away from the
optical transient (GCN#1150), well within the error, verifying the good
quality of the aspect reconstruction in this new pointing mode.  A
detailed data analysis is in progress.glow of GRB011121 with NFI (1SAX
