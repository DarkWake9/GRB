V. Rumyantsev (CrAO), A. Pozanenko (IKI), A. Volnova (SAI MSU)  report on 
behalf of  larger GRB follow-up collaboration:

We observed the field of the INTEGRAL GRB 100713A (Mereghetti et al. GCN 
10951) with  Shajn telescope of  CrAO in VRI-filters starting  July, 13 (UT)
21:56, i.e. 7.4 hours after burst.

We do not detect any sources in enhanced XRT error circle (D'Elia et al. GCN 
10960). The photometry of  stacked images based on SDSS star 
J170053.83+282355.1  assuming  R=16.46, I=16.24 and V=16.78 (the magnitudes 
obtained from  Lupton's SDSS ugriz -> VRI transformations).

T0+      Filter,   Exposure,      Upper Limit
(mid, d)              (s)

0.3539  V          43x60           24.0
0.3546   R         43x60           24.0
0.3553   I          43x60           23.2

Since we do not detect the source observed at 3.75 hours after burst (GCN 
10962)  we can suggest the source reported in GCN 10962 as the afterglow 
candidate.
