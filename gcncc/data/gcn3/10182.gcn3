E. Berger and W. Fong (Harvard) report:

"We imaged the BAT error circle of the short GRB 091117 (GCN #10171) 
with the VLA at a frequency of 8.46 GHz starting on 2009 Nov 20.07 UT. 
In the 1 hour observation only a single source is detected within the 
BAT error circle, in coincidence with the galaxy near XRT Source #2 
(GCNs #10177,10178).  However, inspection of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey 
(NVSS) reveals a coincident archival source, indicating that this is not 
the afterglow of GRB 091117.  No other sources are detected within the 
BAT error circle to a 3-sigma limit of about 120 microJy."
