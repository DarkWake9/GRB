Postigo (IAA-CSIC, DARK), J. Gorosabel (IAA-CSIC), A.J. Castro-Tirado
(IAA-CSIC), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the GRB 120722A XRT error circle (Melandri et
al., GCN 13499; Evans et al., GCN 13502) with the 1.5m telescope at the
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. The observations were
conducted in the I-band with a total exposure time of 16x300s on July
22.86617-22.92716 UT (7.9--9.4 hours post GRB). No object is detected
inside the XRT error circle down to I~21 (Vega mag, calibrated against
USNO-B1.0). We note the presence of a faint object close to the XRT error
circle border located at RA(J2000)=15:21:59.19, Dec(J2000)=+13:15:05.0
(+/-0.9") which seems also present at the SDSS."
