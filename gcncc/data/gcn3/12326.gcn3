report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 02:39:34.42 UT on 03 September 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110903A (trigger 336710376 / 110903111),
which was also detected by  INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et  al. 2011, GCN 12322)
and Konus-Wind (Golenetskii et al. 2011, GCN 12323).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the INTEGRAL position.
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 44 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows/consists of 3 main emission phases
with a duration (T90) of about 339.9 (+/-2.3)s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0 s to T0+339 s is
well fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -0.88 +/- 0.04 and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 281.3 +/- 21.1 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(3.3E-05 +/- 0.1)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+7.7 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 5.24 +/- 0.22 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
