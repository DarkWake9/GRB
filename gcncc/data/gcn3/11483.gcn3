E. Berger (Harvard) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"We observed the field of the short GRB 101219A (GCN 11467) with ACIS-S on
the Chandra X-ray Observatory starting on 2010 December 23.05 UT (3.942
days after the burst) for a total of 19.8 ksec.  We do not detect any
source within the XRT error circle (GCN 11461), or in coincidence with the
proposed host galaxy (GCNs 11464, 11468, 11469).  We place a limit of about
3e-15 erg/cm^2/s (3-sigma) on the flux of the X-ray afterglow at a mean time
of 351.6 ksec after the burst, indicating a decline rate of alpha_X<-1.1.

We thank Harvey Tananbaum and the CXO scheduling staff (in particular Ping
Zhao) for rapidly approving and executing this observation."
