report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:48:42.87 UT on 29 May 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located the very bright and short
GRB 110529A (trigger 110529034 / 110529034).

The on-ground calculated location, using the GBM trigger
data, is RA = 118.33, DEC = 67.91 (J2000 degrees,
equivalent to 7h 53m, +67d 54'), with an uncertainty
of 1.5 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment,
statistical only; there is additionally a systematic
error which is currently estimated to be 2 to 3 degrees).
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 30 degrees.

This GRB was also observed by Konus-Wind (GCN 12045).

The GBM light curve consists of two short bright peaks
with a duration (T90) of about 0.41s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.0 s to T0+.44s is
adequately fit by a Band function with
Epeak = 1161 +/- 265 keV, alpha = -0.88 +/- 0.06,
and beta = -2.05+/- 0.15

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(2.32 +/- 0.01)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 0.256-sec peak photon flux
measured starting from T0+0.00 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 23.6826 +/- 0.68 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
