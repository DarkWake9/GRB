(ISDC, Versoix/IAAT, Tuebingen) and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun)
on behalf of the IBAS Localization Team report:

a long faint and soft gamma-ray burst has been detected by the  
INTEGRAL Burst Alert System in IBIS/ISGRI data on November 11 2009.  
Due to its faintness no automatic alert has been issued and the GRB  
has been identified through the routine off-line analysis of the low  
significance triggers. The GRB starts at 15:21:59 U.T. and lasts for  
about 100 s.

The GRB coordinates (J2000) are

R.A. : 137.8133 [degrees] ,  Dec.: -45.9093 [degrees]

with a 90% c.l. radius unercainty of 2.5 arcmin.

Even if no known X-ray source is present in the IBAS error circle, we  
note that the low galactic latitude of the object and its soft X-ray  
spectrum may indicate also a Galactic transient origin.
The light curve of the GRB will be posted at http://ibas.iasf-milano.inaf.it/IBAS_Results.html
