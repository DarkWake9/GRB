GRB020410: BeppoSAX NFI observation

A BeppoSAX TOO observation of GB020410 has started about 20
hours after the GRB.
A preliminary analysis of MECS (1.6-10 keV) image of the first orbits
shows a bright unknown source in the WFC error circle.

The position is:

RA(2000) = 331.603
Delta(2000) = -83.82

The error radius is 1 arcminute.
