P.M. Woods, E. Gogus, C.A. Wilson, M.H. Finger (NSSTC), J. Swank, C. Markwardt,
T. Strohmayer (GSFC) and D. Smith (UMich) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

SGR 1900+14 entered a new phase of activity starting on February 17 (GCNs 1253,
1254 & 1255).  On Feb 19, we triggered ToO observations of SGR 1900+14 with the
RXTE PCA and found no bursts in 11 ksec of source exposure, however, the count
rate in the PCA (2-10 keV) was found to be much higher than previous monitoring
observations of this SGR.  We measure a flux of 2E-10 ergs/cm^2 sec (2-10 keV),
~20 times brighter than the quiescent level.  No coherent pulsed signal was
detected in the data, but the power spectrum did show excess red noise.  There
are no other cataloged X-ray transients in the 1.1 degree radius FWZM fov of
the PCA and an archival search through the ASM data reveals no significant
excess at the position of the SGR during the last two months.  A PCA scan on
Feb 21 found SGR 1900+14 still active at 10 mCrab and revealed no evidence for
activity from any new source or the nearby Be star transient (XTE J1906+09). 
Hence, all evidence suggests that this excess flux originates from the SGR.  We
note that the excess found on Feb 19 did not fade by Feb 21.  In all previous
burst active states of SGR 1900+14, the excess flux fades rapidly,
approximately as a power-law in time.  Based upon this unusual timing and
spectral behavior, we conclude that we are observing SGR 1900+14 in a new type
of excited state.  Observations at other wavelengths are strongly encouraged.
