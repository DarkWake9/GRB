report:


The radio source localization described in Breger and Frail (GCN 1173)
is at the intersection of our mosaic of November 30 UT with the Calar Alto
1.23-m telescope.  Two R- and two I-band 180sec images overlap,
along with two shorter setup R-band frames.  The coadded image
can be found at
ftp://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/pub/outgoing/aah/grb/grb011130.jpg
The optical source mentioned in Lee, et al. (GCN 1175) is
marginally detected, at about the same magnitude as
shown in the figure by Lee et al.  We therefore suggest that
this object is most likely a constant source.

This message is quotable.
