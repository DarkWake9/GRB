D. Malesani (DARK/NBI), G. Leloudas (OKC Stockholm and DARK/NBI), D. Xu (WIS), J. P. U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), P. Jakobsson (Univ. Iceland), S. Geier (NOT and DARK/NBI) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 120819A (Beardmore et al., GCN 16381) with the NOT equipped with ALFOSC. Observations were carried out in the R and z bands, for a total of 20 and 40 min exposure, respectively.

Within the current XRT position (see http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions/index.php), we detect a source at the following coordinates (J2000):

RA = 15:43:37.84
Dec = -07:18:32.9

with an error of about 0.5". Assuming R = 18.05 for the nearby USNO star at RA = 15:43:38.183, Dec = -07:17:51.72, the object has R = 23.0 +- 0.1. The mean time of the R-band observation is Aug 19.913 UT, that is 8.75 hr after the GRB.

Given the faintness of the source and the lack of information on its temporal behaviour, we cannot state whether this object is related to GRB 120819A.
