W. Fong, E. Berger (Harvard), and J. Mulchaey (OCIW) report:

"We re-observed the position of GRB 110208A (GCN #11678) with LDSS3 on the
Magellan/Clay 6.5-m telescope starting on 2011 February 10.03 UT (27.5 hrs
post-burst). In a single 180-sec i-band exposure we no longer detect the
point source described by Berger et al. (GCN #11681) to a limiting
magnitude of i>22.8 mag (3-sigma). We therefore conclude that this source
is the optical afterglow of GRB 110208A."
