Using the data set from T-60 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 100526B (trigger #423184)
(Siegel, et al., GCN Circ. 10799).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 0.777, -37.913 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  00h 03m 06.5s 
   Dec(J2000) = -37d 54' 48.4" 
with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 95%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a broad weak peak starting at ~T-25 sec,
peaking around T+10 sec, and ending around t+50 sec.  The burst location
went out of the BAT FOV at T+240 sec when Swift was forced to slew due 
to an observing constraint.  T90 (15-350 keV) is 64.0 +- 22.6 sec
(estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-28.4 to T+35.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.47 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.7 +- 0.9 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+11.15 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.1 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
