J. S. Bloom, D. Reichart, D. W. Fox, P. D. Nicholson, C. Dumas, S. R.
Kulkarni, P. A. Price, R. A. Simcoe report on behalf of the larger
Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB collaboration:

"P. Nicholson and C. Dumar obtained two Sloan r' images of the entire
localization position reported for HETE trigger #1760 with the Hale
200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory beginning 45.5 minutes after the
trigger. The instrument used was the Large Format Camera (LFC) and the
observations were 3 min in duration. Visual comparison with the DSS red
image reveals a new source at approximate location (+/- ~2 arcsec; as
compared with the DSS):

     RA:   22:13:31.2 (J2000)
     DEC: -14:59:44

Given that the source is < 4 deg off the ecliptic plane, the source may be
an asteroid."
