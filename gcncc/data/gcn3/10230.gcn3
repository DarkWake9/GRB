Nysewander report:

Skynet continued to observe the afterglow (Smith et al., GCN 10192) of GRB 
091127 (Troja et al., GCN 10191) with four of the 16" PROMPT telescopes at 
CTIO in BVRI.

The light curve (Haislip et al., GCN 10107) continued to roll over. Between 
25.0 hours and 3.4 days after the trigger, the afterglow faded with a 
power-law index of about -1.4 in all bands.

At 3.2 days after the trigger, the afterglow's magnitude was R = 20.71 
+0.15 -0.13 (statistical) +/-  0.37 (systematic; calibrated to 102 USNO B1 
stars).

Skynet's most recent BVRI light curve, calibrated to USNO B1 and NOMAD 
stars, can be found here:
