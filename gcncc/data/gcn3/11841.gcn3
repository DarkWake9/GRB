Hull (UC Berkeley) report:

"We observed the peculiar Swift event GRB110328A / Swift 
J164449.3+573451 (GCNs 11823, 11824) with CARMA beginning on March 30.39 
UT at 98 GHz.  We find a bright, unresolved source coincident with our 
EVLA detection (GCN 11836) with a preliminary flux density of about 15 mJy.

Additional analysis is on-going and further observations are planned. 
We thank the CARMA observatory personnel for their support of these 
observations."
