behalf of the Swift Team:

At 19:06:47 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered on
Swift J1910.2-0546 (trigger=524642).  Swift will execute a delayed slewed 
due to the Earth observing constraint (49 min delay). 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 287.577, -5.806, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  19h 10m 18s
   Dec(J2000) = -05d 48' 22"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  As is typical for image triggers (27 min),
the TDRSS lightcurve does not show anything significant. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 20:30UT. There will 
be no XRT or UVOT data until this time. 

Swift J1910.2-0546, discovered by BAT on May 30th, 2012 (Krimm
et al., ATEL #4139), has been seen to be rising in the BAT Transient
Monitor for several days, leading to this trigger.
