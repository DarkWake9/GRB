At 15:39:31 UTC, Swift-BAT detected a rate increase due to GRB 101129A
(BAT trigger #439471. Only a sub-threshold image source was found
onboard.  This event corresponds to Fermi GBM trigger #312737973. The
IPN was alerted.  In ground analysis, the source was detected with
slightly greater confidence at RA, Dec 155.921, -17.645 which is:

RA (J2000)       10h 23m 41s
Dec (J2000)    -17d 38m 42s

with an estimated uncertainty radius of 3 arcmin (90% containment).
Correlation of Swift-BAT counting rates and SPI-ACS counting rates,
and SPI-ACS with Messenger yielded intersecting annuli consistent with
this position. The burst was also detected by Suzaku-WAM.

As seen in BAT, the burst consisted of a single pulse with a T90 of about
0.35 +- 0.05 sec.

The burst was faint and short. The low-number statistics in BAT make a
fit to the spectrum very uncertain. The photon index was approximately
0.8 +- 0.5.  The fluence was approximately (9 +- 5) x 10^-08 ergs/cm^2.

A Swift TOO observation was executed at 11 hours after the burst.  The
location of the burst was observed by the Swift-XRT and Swift-UVOT for
a total of about 1400 seconds.  No afterglow was detected.  No further
observations are planned.
