George Younes (MSFC/USRA) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:

"At 00:24:24.51 UT on 07 September 2012, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 120907A (trigger 368670267 / 120907017)
which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Barthelmy et al. 2012, GCN 13716).
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 110 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of a single pulse with a duration (T90)
of about 5.8 s (50-300 keV).
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.4 s to T0+0.7 s is
best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.75 +/- 0.25 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 154.50 +/- 32.90 keV.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(7.8 +/- 1.1)E-07 ergs/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0-1.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band
is 4.3 +/- 0.4  ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
