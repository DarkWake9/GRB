The field of GRB 101225A was observed with CQUEAN, an optical
CCD camera attached at the 2.1m telescope at McDonald Observatory,
USA. The observation was carried out from 01:16:23 UT, Dec. 26, 2010,
with i, r, z, and Y filters, with exposures of 3 * 300 secs for each
band.

The afterglow was clearly visible on i and r-band images at
the same position reported by Xu et al.(GCN 11495). We obtained
the preliminary magnitude of the afterglow on the stacked i-band
image calibrated with the neighboring USNO B-1.0 stars:
R = 22.60 +- 0.19 at 01:42:47 UT. Further analysis of the data is
ongoing.
