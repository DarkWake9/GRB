OT1_mhuang01 Open Time program:

Herschel Space Observatory has observed GRB 110422A according to the
plan (Huang et al GCN 11985).  Preliminary data reduction has shown
statistically significant (S/N ~ 10) detection in 170um and 250um bands
at a few mJy level. Scheduled follow-up observations and further
analyses of foreground/background sources will be conducted to
determine whether the emission is variable (dominated by the afterglow)
or from the host galaxy of GRB 110422A and Galactic ISM.
