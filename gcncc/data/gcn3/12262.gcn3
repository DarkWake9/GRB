Using the data set from T-471 to T+639 sec from recent telemetry downlinks,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110808A (trigger #458918)
(Stratta, et al., GCN Circ. 12256).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 57.322, -44.177 deg which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  03h 49m 17.2s 
   Dec(J2000) = -44d 10' 35.4" 
with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 76%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a FRED pulse shape starting at ~T+0 sec,
peaking at ~T+1 sec, and returning the baseline at ~T+50 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 48 +- 23 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-7.4 to T+40.6 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
2.32 +- 0.43.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 3.3 +- 0.8 x 10^-7 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.06 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 0.4 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
