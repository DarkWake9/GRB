C.Kouveliotou, A. F. Tennant, M. C. Weisskopf, NASA/MSFC, report on
behalf of a large SGR collaboration:

Chandra observed the newly active (GCN #1041) Soft Gamma Repeater,
SGR 1900+14, on April 22, 2001 starting at 4:45 UT, for 20,000 seconds.
The ACIS S3 observation mode was Continuous Clocking (CC). We have fitted a
spectrum to the whole data set; we find the best fit to be a single power law
with spectral (photon) index of 2.9 +/- 0.1 and a hydrogen column density (NH)
of (3.4 +/- 0.1)x10^22 cm^-2. We detect no black body contribution in 
the spectrum.  The source (unabsorbed) flux is 1.1x10^-11 ergs/cm^2 s
(2-10 keV), nearly identical to the quiescent source flux level.
The pulse period is 5.1725 s (barycenter corrected); the pulse profile
appears sinusoidal.

More detailed analysis and comparison with RXTE simultaneous 
observations is underway.
