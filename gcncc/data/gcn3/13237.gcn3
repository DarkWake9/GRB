behalf of the Swift Team:

At 23:08:33 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located an outburst from SGR1806-20 (trigger=519868).  Swift did not slew because
of the Moon observering constraint.  The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 272.153, -20.410 which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  18h 08m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = -20d 24' 35"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single spike
with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~13,000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint Swift will be unable to observe this
field with the XRT and UVOT instruments until 12 April at 14:00 UT.
