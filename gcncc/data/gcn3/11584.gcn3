Using the data set from T-240 to T+713 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 110119A (trigger #442978)
(Troja, et al., GCN Circ. 11581).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 348.589, 5.982 deg, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  23h 14m 21.3s 
   Dec(J2000) = +05d 58' 54.3" 
with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 100%.
 
The mask-weighted light curve shows a cluster of 4 or 5 overlapping peaks
starting at ~T-90 sec and ending at ~T+90 sec, then a second cluster
of 2 or 3 peaks starting at ~T+110 sec and ending at ~T+260 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 208 +- 13 sec (estimated error including systematics).
 
The time-averaged spectrum from T-86.4 to T+215.5 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.44 +- 0.05.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.0 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+33.16 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 2.2 +- 0.1 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.
