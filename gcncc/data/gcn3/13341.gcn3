The long GRB 120522A (IPN localization: Hurley at al., GCN 13340)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=11467.377s UT (03:11:07.377)

The light curve shows multiple partly overlapped pulses.
A total duration of the burst is ~13 s.
The emission is seen up to ~6 MeV.
The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB120522_T11467/

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 2.5(-0.2,+0.2)x10-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+6.528 s,
of 9.3(-0.9,+0.9)x10-6 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+78.086 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.88 (-0.05, +0.05),
and Ep = 381(-33, +40) keV,
chi2 = 100.1/84 dof.

The spectrum at the maximum count rate
(measured from T0+0.256 to T0+7.168 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model, for which
alpha = -0.79 (-0.05, +0.05),
and Ep = 379(-32, +37) keV,
chi2 = 89.5/84 dof.

All the quoted results are preliminary.
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
