A.J. Castro-Tirado (IAA-CSIC), J.C. Tello (IAA-CSIC), M. Jelinek
(IAA-CSIC), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

"I-band observations conducted with the Calar Alto 1.23m telescope at
21:41:19.1--22:04:02.4 UT (obs started ~13 minutes post GRB) for GRB
120805A reveal no object inside the XRT position (GCN Circ. 13588) down to
I~18 (Vega). However, we note the presence an object located at
RA(J2000)=14:26:09.12, DEC(J2000)=05:49:31.7 (error of ~0.5" in both
coordinates) with a magnitude of I~17.5 which seems not to be at the SDSS.
Given the lack of a refined XRT position yet, we are cautious about the
possible relation of this object with the GRB 120805A optical afterglow."
