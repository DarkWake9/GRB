We observed GRB 120119A (GCN 12859, Beardmore et al.) in B,V,R- bands
with a 1 m telescope at Mt. Lemmon, Arizona, US.
The observation began at 06:03:31 UT, ~ 2 hours after burst alert.
We took 3 frames for each filter with the exposure time, 300 secs

The afterglow candidate was detected in stacked images of all three filters
with a preliminary magnitude R ~ 20.3 +/- 0.2 mag.
The photometry calibration is based on two USNO B1.0 stars,
USNO-B1.0 0809-0167573 and 0808-0168858

We thank the LOAO operator, J. Yoon for his help with the observation.
