To GCN Notice Recipients (socket-based & email-based):
The recent series of four copies of the BAT Slew Burst position Notice
(ID_NUM 575 and RA,Dec=222.720,+41.310) are all due to my debuging
a problem in a related part of GCN.
They are all playback copies of a previously real notice.
I forgot to turn on the block2world filter for this notice type
while doing the playback debugging.
Please totally disregard the 4 notices in the last hour.
My sincere apologies for the confusion and lost effort
in chasing these repeated notices.
