A. von Kienlin (MPE) reports on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: 

"At 11:17:20.29 UT on 07 February 2011, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor
triggered and located GRB 110207A (trigger 318770242/ 110207470), which was
also 
detected by the Swift/BAT (Littlejohns et al. 2011, GCN 11658)
The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.
 
The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 72.8 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a multi-peaked structure
with a duration (T90) of about 39 s (50-300 keV). 
The time-averaged spectrum from T0-0.256 s to T0+38.912 s is 
best fit by a power law function with an exponential
high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.09 (+0.13/-0.12) and
the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 450 (+290/-130) 
keV. The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is 
(4.4 +/- 0.6)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1.024-sec peak photon flux measured 
starting from T0+0.211 s in the 10-1000 keV band 
is 2.3 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; 
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog."
