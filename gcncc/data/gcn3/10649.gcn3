SUBJECT: GRB 100414A:  Radio Afterglow Detection with the Expanded VLA

Poonam Chandra (RMC), Dale A. Frail (NRAO), S. Bradley Cenko (Berkeley)
and Fiona Harrison (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We used the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) to observe the
Fermi burst GRB 100414A (Takahashi et al, GCN 10594 Foley GCN 10595)
on 2010 Apr 19 UT Within the revised XRT error circle (Goad et al
GCN 10605).

We detect the GRB afterglow with a flux density of 406 +/- 22 uJy.


The EVLA is undergoing active commissioning and as such these results
should be considered preliminary=2E Further observations are planned.
The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National
Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated
Universities Inc.
