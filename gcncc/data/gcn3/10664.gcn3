J. W. Moody, D. Laney, R. Pearson, and C. Pace report for the BYU ROVOR team:
Beginning 35 hours after the initial detection of GRB 100418A we
obtained BVR optical data using the BYU WMO 0.9m telescope.
Preliminary magnitudes were found by referencing against USNO-B1.0
star 1014-0271368 (RA(J2000) = 17:05:26.42, Dec(J2000) = +11:27:32.9).
 Assuming B=18.66, V=18.00 and R=17.32 we obtain the following values:

post burst
t_mid(hr)   exp.(min)  filter  mag.  error
37.18        25
35.91
35.25


Poor weather prevented observations on 2010-04-21 and 2010-04-22
