Team:

At 01:51:31 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 110928A (trigger=504215).  Swift will slew after 52 minutes
after the Earth limb constraint is avoided. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 257.755, +36.570, which is 
   RA(J2000)  =  17h 11m 01s
   Dec(J2000) = +36d 34' 13"
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows a single FRED-like 
pulse with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 

Due to an observing constraint, Swift will not slew until 
T0+52 minutes. There will be no XRT or UVOT data until
this time. 

Burst Advocate for this burst is E. A. Hoversten (hoversten AT astro.psu.edu). 
Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information
regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after
trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see
Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)
