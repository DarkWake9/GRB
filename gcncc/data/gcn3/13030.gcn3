with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK
National Observatory, Turkey) on March 08, 2012, UT(mean)= 22:35,
approximately 16 hours after the burst. A serie of exposures by 300
sec each in Rc filter was obtained at moderate weather conditions.

We marginaly detected optical source at the position of OT (Virgili et
al., GCN 13018) and estimated its Rc ~ 22.5 mag in our combined image.
