Klotz A. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP), Gendre B. (ASDC/INAF-OAR),
Boer M. (UNS-CNRS-OCA), Atteia J.L. (IRAP-CNRS-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 120811C detected by SWIFT
(trigger 530689) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

The observations started 3.98h after the GRB trigger.
The elevation of the field decreased from
50 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good.

We co-added a series of exposures but we do not find
any optical transcient at the afterglow position
(Barlow et al. GCNC 13622, Denisenko et al. GCNC 13623):

Magnitudes were estimated with the nearby USNO-B1 stars
and are not corrected for galactic dust extinction.
