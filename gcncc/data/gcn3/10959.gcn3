H. Naito, T. Sako, D. Suzuki, S. Kobara and K. Omori (Nagoya Univ.) on  
behalf of the MOA Collaboration, T. Nagayama, M. Kurita (Nagoya  
Univ.), S. Crawford and S. Randriamampandry (South African  
Astronomical Observatory) on behalf of the IRSF Collaboration report:

We searched for a NIR afterglow of the GRB 100713A detected by  
INTEGRAL (Mereghetti et al., GCN 10951) starting from 19:42:07 UT on  
2010 July 13 (5.1 hours after the burst) with the SIRIUS on the IRSF  
1.4m telescope at SAAO in South Africa. In images of a 30 min exposure  
with J, H and Ks filter, we did not find any object within the error  
circle of the Swift XRT source position (V. D'Elia et al., GCN 10952).

A 3 sigma upper limits are the followings.

J > 18.9
H > 18.0
K > 17.4

This photometry was done by using the DoPHOT and calibrated against  
the 2MASS cataloged stars. The Galactic extinction was not corrected.
