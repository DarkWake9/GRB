Zerbi, V. Testa, G. Tosti, F. Vitali, L.A. Antonelli, P. Conconi, G. Cutispoto,
G. Malaspina, L. Nicastro, E. Palazzi, E. Meurs, and P. Goldoni report on  
behalf of the REM/ROSS team:

We imaged the field of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) with  the  
robotic 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla (Chile). Observations 
were performed automatically in the near infrared (J, H, K, z bands) 
starting 62 s after the GCN alert (almost 14 minutes after the GRB).

The first observations were performed at about airmass 6.8, under 
difficult conditions.

Preliminary analysis of the dataset does not show any new source down to 
approximately H = 15.2 at the position of the optical afterglow reported 
by Cummings et al. (GCN 5117) and Mundell et al. (GCNs 5118, 5119).

Further observations and analysis are still in progress.

N. Masetti, E. Maiorano (INAF/IASF Bo), A. Magazzu', G. Mainella 
(INAF/TNG), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the optical afterglow of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 
5117) with the 3.6 TNG telescope located in the Canary Islands. Two 
R-band observations were acquired under good observing conditions, with 
mean times May 13.018 and May 13.065 UT (1.2 and 2.3 hr after the GRB, 
respectively). The optical afterglow (Cummings et al., GCN 5117; Mundell 
& Steele, GCN 5118) is well detected and faded by 0.58 +- 0.04 mag 
between the two epocs. The inferred decay index is alpha = 0.81 +- 0.06, 
assuming a flux decay F(t) = K*t^-alpha.

We acknowledge significant support from the observing staff at TNG.

S. B. Cenko (Caltech) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) with the
automated Palomar 60-inch Telescope.  Observations consisted of 5 x 150 s
exposures taken in the Kron R band.  The mean epoch of our observations
was approximately 03:50 13 May 2006 UT (~ 4.6 hrs after the burst).  We
clearly detect the afterglow and measure an R-band magnitude of R ~ 20.1
(calculated with respect to the USNO-B catalog).

Comparing with the early afterglow detection reported by Mundell and
Steele (GCN 5119), we measure a decay index of alpha ~ 1.0.  We note this
is slightly steeper than the value reported by Malesani et al. (GCN 5122),
although not significant enough to claim a break in the light curve.

Further observations are underway.

We have observed the afterglow (Cummings et al, GCN 5117; Mundell and
Steele, GCN 5118; Malesani et al., GCN 5122; Cenko, GCN 5125) of GRB
060512, a  bright burst localized by Swift BAT (Cummings et al., GCNs
5117, 5124), beginning at about 5:36 UT on 13 May 2006 (about 6.4 hours
after the burst) under partly cloudy conditions, using NIC-FPS on the
ARC 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory.  The observation
consisted of a series of 15 20-second exposures in Ks.  From them, we
have constructed a stacked image of the GRB field, corresponding to a
5-minute exposure.

We measure a magnitude for the afterglow of Ks = 17.7 +/-0.2.  Further 
observations are underway.

NIC-FPS is currently in its commissioning phase.

We observed the field of GRB 060512
starting at UT=05:48 (~6.6 hrs after the burst),
with the 1.54m Kuiper telescope at Mt. Bigelow, AZ.
We obtained 5 x 300-sec images in the R-band filter.
The mean epoch of observations was 05:59 13 May 2006.
Observing conditions were affected by thin clouds
in addition to the bright moon.
 
We detect the candidate optical counterpart reported
by Cummings et al. (GCN 5117), Mundell and Steele (GCN 5118),
Malesani et al. (GCN 5122) , Cenko (GCN 5125), and
Hearty et al. (GCN 5126). Based upon comparison with
USNO-B stars, we estimate the magnitude to be
R=20.14 +/- 0.16.

report on behalf of the Subaru GRB team and the MOIRCS team:

"We observed the field of GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., GCN 5117) 
with MOIRCS on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope at 11:02 UT (11.8 hours
after the burst).

With the 2x60s exposure, we detected the source with Ks=18.4 +/- 0.2.
Comparison with the earlier NIR detection (Hearty et al., GCN 5126)
implies a decay index of 1.05 +/- 0.07 in the Ks band.
It is consistent with the decay index reported by Cenko (GCN 5125)
based on the R band observations at 46 min (Mundell and Steele, GCN
5119) and 4.6 hours after the burst. "

  M. De Pasquale (UCL-MSSL) and J. Cummings (NASA/ORAU)
report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:

The Swift/UVOT began observing the afterglow of
GRB 060512 (Cummings et al., 5117) at 2006-05-12 at
23:14:54, 94 s after the BAT trigger. A bright
optical afterglow is detected in the U, V, B,
and white filters inside the XRT refined error
circle (Godet et al., GCN 5128).

We obtain the following photometry of the afterglow.

  The detection in the U, B and V, together with the non-detection
in the UV filters, may indicate that the redshift of this burst is
less than approximately 2.5.

The values quoted above are not corrected for the low expected
Galactic extinction E(B-V)=0.02.

DATE:    06/05/15 15:07:31 GMT
FROM:    Alain Klotz at CESR-CNRS  <Alain.Klotz@free.fr>

 Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We imaged the field of GRB 060512 detected by SWIFT
(trigger 209755) with the TAROT robotic telescope (D=25cm)
located at the Calern observatory, France.

First image was acquired 796.8s after the GRB trigger
(5s after the notice). The field elevation decreased from
65 degrees above horizon and weather conditions
were good but the full moon was at 68 deg from the
GRB position.

We detected the OT source mentioned by Cummings et al
(GCNC 5117). We co-added series of unfiltered
exposures to increase signal to noise ratio:

t-t_trig (min)
begin -   end   CRmag     1*sigma(mag.)
  13.3   34.7   17.64     0.28
  34.8  228.3   19.03     0.60
t_trig = 2006-05-12T23:13:20.640 (Date of trigger)

CR means Clear filter calibrated by R magnitude.
Magnitudes were estimated by PSF fit with the
two following nearby USNO-B1 stars:

1311-0234453 R=16.63 (I=14.94)
1311-0234485 R=17.09 (I=15.87)

We combined R optical observations
(Mundell et al. GCNC 5119,
Malesani et al. GCNC 5122 assuming R=18.65 at t-t_trig=1.2h,
Cenko et al. GCNC 5125,
Milne et al. GCNC 5127)
with those of TAROT.
All these data are compatible with a
decay index alpha 0.85 +/- 0.08 (assuming a
flux decay F(t) = K*t^-alpha).

FROM:    S. Bradley Cenko at Caltech  <cenko@srl.caltech.edu>

S. B. Cenko and W. H. Baumgartner (Caltech) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:

We have imaged the field of GRB060512 (Cummings et al.; GCN 5117) with the
Large Format Camera mounted on the 5-m Palomar Hale Telescope.
Observations consisted of 5 x 180 s images in the r' filter taken at a
mean epoch of May 21.25 UT.  At the location of the optical afterglow, we
detect an object with approximate r' magnitude 23.7 +/- 0.2 (calculated
with respect the SDSS calibration provided by Cool et al.; GCN 5120).

If we assume limited contamination from an underlying host galaxy, the
afterglow decay remains consistent with the early-time power-law index of
0.85 (Klotz et al.; GCN 5140), indicating a late jet-break time.  However,
futher observations are required to verify the host galaxy brightness.

D. Sharapov (MAO and NOT, La Palma), A. Djupvik (NOT, La Palma) ,
A.Pozanenko (IKI) on behalf of larger GRB follow up collaboration report:

We observed  optical afterglow of GRB060512  (Cummings et al. GCN 5117;
Klotz et al. GCN 5140)  in Nordic Optical Telescope with NOTcam in near IR
(J) on May 13 between (UT) 02.40 - 03:44.  A  brightness of the OT is
following:

J mag, Err,Exposure,  T0+ (Mid time,s)

18.90 0.09  8x90s  12838
18.96 0.09  8x90s  13849
19.09 0.10  8x90s  14843
19.14 0.11  8x90s  15835

The calibration is based on 2MASS star RA  = 13:02:57.846 DEC =
+41:10:23.08, J = 14.485 +/-0.03 and consistent with calibration based on IR
standard star observation in the same night.  A power law decay index alpha
~ 1.1 in J between   (UT) 02.40 - 03:44 (May ,13) is compatible with the
index deduced from  Ks observations (Hearty et al. GCN 5126, Tanaka et al.
GCN 5129).

The first combined image of  8x90s exposure can be found in
