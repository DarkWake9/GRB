Observation log and photometry of the transient source.
Errors are at the 1σ confidence level, while upper limits are given
at 3σ. Note that the CAFOS and FORS2 I-band filters (which we
called I1 and I2) are different (their central wavelengths being 8500 Å
and 7680 Å, respectively). Since the Lyman α break falls within this
band dropout is occuring inside this band, this leads to a significant
magnitude difference.

Notes.—The observations were made at a mean
epoch of 2005 September 4.60 and may be treated
as simultaneous; any correction to the fluxes for the
decay of the afterglow over the course of the observations
would be smaller than the measurement errors
(0.15mag, using a temporal decay index of 1.2;
Haislip et al. 2005). These measurements are not
corrected for the relatively small foreground Milky
Way extinction. The R- and I-band measurements
are consistent with no detections to 3  upper limits
on the fluxes of 2.3 and 3.6 Jy, respectively.

*Error bars are 1j and upper limits are 3j.
We calibrated the r 0 i 0 z0 measurements using stellar Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sources and derived RcIc field calibrations from the SDSS field calibrations24. We obtained YJHKsK field
calibrations using SOAR and ZJHK field calibrations using UKIRT. The JHK field calibrations are in agreement with each other and with the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). However, the
UKIRT Z-band measurement, which we obtained 11.4 h after the burst, is a factor of three below the fitted model (Fig. 2). The UKIRT WFCAM Z bandpass was designed to match the effective
wavelength of the SDSS z0 bandpass (0.876 versus 0.887 mm), but with a rectangular profile. The standard deviation of the magnitude differences for all stellar SDSS sources in the UKIRT Z
field and the Gemini South z0 field, which we obtained 3.2 days after the burst, is only 0.064 mag. When converting from magnitudes to spectral fluxes, we used the correct zero points for Z
and z0 , respectively. When fitting to these spectral fluxes, we used the actual UKIRT WFCAM Z and Gemini South GMOS-S z0 bandpasses. No modification of the model spectrum (for
example, dust extinction21, molecular hydrogen absorption25, or the Lya damping wing) appears to be able to accommodate both measurements simultaneously. Consequently, we conclude
that this factor-of-three deficit is not only real but probably temporal in nature.

Klotz, A. (CESR-OMP), Boer M. (OHP), Atteia J.L. (LATT-OMP) report:

We did not explore the location of the Haislip
et al. (GCNC 3913) source candidate in the first
analyzis reported in GCNC 3911. This source is
detected in three composited images taken by TAROT
in the 8 first minutes after GRB. Magnitudes are
calculated using the R USNO-B magnitudes of three
nearby stars.

   312      370    R=18.7 +/- 0.3

Corresponding images can be seen at:
http://www.cesr.fr/~klotz/grb050904

After 8 minutes, the CCD camera cooler failed.
Then, images are very noisy. We will try to
obtain corresponding dark frames in the next
days to reprocess images after t_GRB+8 min.

Swift/UVOT began observing the field of GRB050904 at 01:54:25 UT,
164 s after the BAT trigger (Cummings, et al., GCN 3910) in all the six 
filters.
In the first 100 s V-band image (T+ 214 s), no new source is detected with
respect to the DSS down to a 3 sigma upper limit of 18.9 mag in the XRT 
error
circle (GCN 3910).
At T+90 min after the trigger, in a single 900 s V-band image the upper 
limit
was 20.1.

The instrument continued to collect data during all the other orbits
detecting no new source down to the following upper limits:

Filter  Start_Time(UT)  Stop_Time(UT)  Exp(s) 3sig_limit
 
V         01:54          16:20         4887    20.9

UVW2      01:57          18:26         4331    21.4

Where Start_Time and Stop_Time are the time range over wich the summed 
images
were accumulated and Exp is the total exposure time (in seconds) of the 
summed image.
The magnitude upper limits are not corrected for extinction.
These non-detections are consistent with a high redshift GRB,
as reported by J. Haislip, et al. (GCN 3914 and 3919).
These magnitudes are based on preliminary zero-points, measured
in orbit, and will require refinement with further calibration.
