Arto Oksanen (Muurame, Finland) and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Varkaus, Finland) 
report to the AAVSO High Energy Network the following optical observations 
of GRB 080430 (Guidorzi et al., GCN Circular #7647):

Arto Oksanen (Hankasalmi Obs., Hankasalmi, Finland) reports the detection 
of the optical counterpart of GRB 080430.  Unfiltered observations were 
made using a 0.4-meter RC telescope with an SBIG STL-1001E CCD.  The 
initial Swift XRT position was observed unfiltered with an initial set of 
10 60-second exposures having a mid-point time of 2008 April 30, 20:08:54 
UT; the afterglow was detected with a magnitude of 18.1 +/- 0.05 
calibrated relative to GSC 3450-0639.  Astrometry of the initial frames 
yields a position of RA 11:01:14.76 , Dec +51:41:08.9 (USNOA2.0 ref, +/- 
0.4 arcseconds), which is within the stated uncertainties of the UVOT 
position (GCNCirc #7647).

Images taken between April 30.839 and April 30.969 UT were reanalyzed and 
calibrated relative to two USNO-B1.0 stars of magnitude ~16.5. Photometry 
of combined frames yields a smoothly decaying light curve during the span 
of observations:

    obs midpoint 	  CR	error
2008 April 30.839	17.798	0.088
2008 April 30.849	18.329	0.120
2008 April 30.860	18.484	0.087
2008 April 30.875	18.751	0.076

Markku Nissinen and Veli-Pekka Hentunen (Taurus Hill Observatory, Varkaus, 
Finland) also report the detection of the optical afterglow of GRB 080430. 
Observations were made using a Meade LX-200 0.3-meter telescope with an 
SBIG ST8-XME CCD; observations were made using both clear and R filters. 
A total of six 600-second exposures were obtained having an average 
midpoint time of 2008 April 30.943.  Photometry of the combined clear and 
Rc frames yields magnitudes of CR=19.2+/-0.3 and R=19.5+/-0.5 calibrated 
relative to the GSC2.3 star N7JI005540.  The observers noted the sky was 
not completely dark due to their high latitude and time of year.

The AAVSO thanks the Curry Foundation for their continued support of the 
AAVSO International High Energy Network.

report:

We observed the afterglow (GCN 7646, Klotz et al.) of GRB 080430 (GCN
7647, Guidorzi et al.) with MOSCA at the NOT/La Palma on Apr. 30 starting
1.21h after the burst. Observations in UBVRI filters with exposure times
of 150s in each filter were acquired.
The afterglow is clearly detected in all bands and we derive the following
preliminary magnitudes based on the pre-burst SDSS calibrations (GCN 7649,
Cool et al.) and standard transformations between SDSS and Bessell
filters, times given are the start of the exposures.

t-t0(h)  band   mag
1.92     U         19.9 +- 0.2
1.74     B         19.8 +- 0.1
1.56     V         19.3 +- 0.1
1.21     R         19.0 +- 0.1
1.38     I           18.7 +- 0.1

The blue colors and the detection down to the U band are consistent with
the low redshift of that burst, z=0.767 as found by de Ugarte Postigo et
al. (GCN 7650) and Cucchiara et al. (GCN 7654).

W.B. Landsman (NASA/GSFC) and C. Guidorzi (INAF-OAB)  report on behalf 
of the Swift/UVOT team

The Swift/UVOT observed the field of GRB 080430 starting at 58s after  
the BAT trigger (Guidorzi et al., GCN 7647). We detect the afterglow in 
all seven UVOT filters at the position

RA(J2000.0)  =   11:01:14.66
DEC(J2000.0) =  +51:41:08.4

with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  
This position is consistent with the enhanced XRT position (Guidorzi et 
al. GCN 7653)
and the position reported from  BOOTES obervations by Jelinek et al.  
(GCN 7648).     The detection in the UVW2 (1950 A) filter is consistent 
with the
redshift of ~0.76 determined from spectroscopic observations by Deugarte 
Postigo et al. (GCN 7650) and  Cucchiara & Fox (GCN 7654). The temporal 
slope in the white filter out to 30400 seconds is approximately alpha = 
0.23.

UVOT photometry from early individual images is reported below.

These magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic extinction  
corresponding to a reddening of E{B-V} = 0.012 mag (Schlegel et al. 
1998).  The photometry is on the UVOT flight system described in Poole 
et al. (2008,MNRAS,383,627).

report:

The optical counterpart (GCN7646) of GRB 080430 (GCN 7647) was observed 
with Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK 
National Observatory, Turkey), starting at May 01, 21:58 UT, i.e.
~26.08 hours after the burst, using Andor CCD.

A series of frames 3*300s in R and 3*600s in B bands were made.
The afterglow is clearly detected  in all images. Using USNO-B1 star
(416-022819, RA=11:01:16.86, DEC=+51:40:38.5, B2MAG=17.79, R2MAG=16.61)
we estimated the following magnitudes for the OT  on combined images:

t-t0 (h)	band	mag 	err
26.25		R	21.3	0.1
27.98		B	22.3	0.1
